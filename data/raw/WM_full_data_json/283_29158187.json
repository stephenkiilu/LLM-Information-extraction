    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases underlie many forms of age-related cognitive impairment and the mechanism linking the two is hypothesized to involve adverse changes in white matter (WM) integrity. Despite being systemic, small vessel disease does not uniformly affect WM. We performed voxel-wise analysis of MRI images to examine the association between fractional anisotropy (FA) -a diffusion tensor measure of WM structural integrity -and pulsatility index (PI) -a transcranial Doppler ultrasound measure of abnormal arterial flow -in adults over the age of 70 years who were free of stroke and dementia. We demonstrate that the relation of PI to microstructural changes in WM is artery specific and regional. We identified spatial clusters of significant correlations between elevated PI and reduced FA which can not be explained by aging, supporting a vascular hypothesis of WM injury. These areas are not limited to the vascular territories of the vessels where PI is assessed, suggesting that the linkage between PI and FA is not likely a function of perfusion per se, but is consistent with injury caused by mechanical wave emanating from pulsating vessel walls.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Growing recognition that cerebrovascular diseases underlie many forms of age-related cognitive decline and dementia 12345 makes vascular risk factors important targets for intervention. Whether vascular pathology exacerbates the impairment or whether the two are synergistic remains unclear, but the mechanism linking the two is believed to involve white matter (WM) injury. At advanced stages, this injury manifests as white matter hyperintense (WMHI) lesions on T2-weighted FLAIR MRI images 4,6 and is reportedly associated with elevated blood flow pulsatility index (PI) -a marker of cerebrovascular small vessel disease -in normal elderly population 78910111213. Given that WMHIs result from a long term accumulated WM damage, linking PI to white matter pathology at an earlier stage, before onset of dementia, may provide a tool to screen and monitor population at risk for developing it later in life.\nTwo groups investigated the relationship between pulsatility index and fractional anisotropy (FA) -an early marker of WM integrity 14 as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) -with conflicting results 12,13. Based on the premise that small vessel disease diffusely affects all intracranial arteries and the entire brain, these studies examined the association between pulsatility index and FA averaged over large predefined white matter regions. The first study found a strong association between elevated pulsatility and reduced average white matter FA 12, while the second observed no significant relation in similar brain areas in patients of similar group 13.\nThe discordance between results of these studies may be attributed to several factors: PI was measured using different techniques (MRI versus transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound) and in different arteries (basilar and carotid versus middle cerebral arteries), DTI acquisitions used drastically different b-values (3000 versus 700 secmm 2 ). Because both studies operated under the same hypothesis that FA changes are not limited to the vascular territories of the arteries where pulsatility is evaluated, choice of arteries was driven by measurement convenience, PI from left and right arteries were averaged and FA was averaged over large regions. These factors may decrease sensitivity of the analyses or distort their results if, in fact, another hypothesis is true.\nPulsatility index refers to the Gossling pulsatility index (PI) expressed as the ratio of the range of the blood flow velocity over the cardiac cycle to its mean 15. By this definition, PI in aorta is expected to differ from PI in carotid arteries and indeed anatomical differences in left and right vascularization may be sufficient to cause lateral differences in PI 16. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predictive value of PI with respect to FA changes in white matter may be expected to depend on the artery in which it is being assessed. Moreover, although small vessel disease is systemic, its diffuse character does not imply that the brain is uniformly affected. The degree to which WM is susceptible to vascular disease and is damaged by it may vary with spatial location or limited to specific vascular territories.\nConsequently, performing analysis without spatially averaging FAs and pulsatilities will increase sensitivity to detect such spatially heterogeneous processes.\nIn this study we apply a voxel-wise approach to examine relationship between white matter integrity assessed using FA and TCD-derived pulsatility index in the major cerebral arteries of normal elderly subjects. We determine in which cerebral artery PI has the strongest association with changes in FA. We then contemplate as to the possible causal mechanism of the observed relationships between PI and FA.",

EAS participants were recruited through systematic sampling from Medicare and voter registration lists for Bronx County, New York 17. EAS participants receive annual in-person assessments which include medical history, neuropsychological testing and general medical and neurological examinations. Exclusion criteria included visual or auditory impairments that preclude neuropsychological testing, active psychiatric symptomatology that interfered with the ability to complete assessments, and non-ambulatory status.

TCD examination assessed blood flow velocities in the vertebral arteries (VA at a 60 mm depth) and basilar artery (BA a 90-100 mm depth) through a transforaminal window; and the middle cerebral arteries (MCA; distal M1 segment at a 50-65 mm depth), the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA; P1 segment at a 60-65 mm depth) and the anterior cerebral arteries (ACA; A1 at a 60-70 mm depth) through a temporal acoustic window. Blood flow velocity in these nine arteries was analyzed off-line using the imaging reading work station (ImagePro). Specifically, we measured: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and mean flow velocity (MFV). The pulsatility index was calculated using the Gosling equation, PI  (PSV -EDV)MFV 15. Because PI is defined as the ratio of the velocities, it is not sensitive to the orientation of the probe with respect to the direction of the flow in the vessel. TCD measures could not be obtained in all vessels in all subjects due to normal variations of anatomy and availability of acoustic windows. To increase sensitivity of the analyses, we included all available data for each vessel.",

First, non-brain voxels were removed from all images using the FMRIB-FSL software 19,20. Subsequently, eddy current correction followed by tensor fitting of the diffusion data to produce maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and image unweighted for diffusion (the S0 image) were performed using FSLs diffusion toolbox 21. Then, EPI distortion in S0 and FA maps was removed using FUGUE of FSL utilizing auxiliary field map 22. To achieve the best registration of the field map to DTI, field map was first distorted the same way the DTI is distorted and then the rigid body transformation needed to match it to the DTI was appled to the original field map. Although this field map does not match the DTI image when overlaid -one is still distorted the other is not -it is actually properly registered and ready to be used in FUGUE 23. Small distortions in the T1-weighted image caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities around sinuses were removed in the same fashion. Finally, rigid body transformation was applied to FA map to register it to the T1-weighted image. Similar to the use of gray and white matter masks to increase robustness of registration of images to a template 24, all rigid body transformations were obtained as ones needed to register white matter masks segmented out by the FAST routine of FSL from the input and target images.",

Because quality of registration to a template is sensitive to the similarity of a brain to the template, to improve the overall quality we selected a study-specific central template -a template requiring least average deformation of the brains in the study -with the idea that smaller deformations are accompanied by smaller registration errors 28. Specifically, we identified a T1-weighted image as our study-specific template from a pool of 17 randomly selected subjects by examining deformations after morphing them to each other. Statistical analyses were performed using data registered to this template.",

      "text": "The sample cohort consisted of 107 subjects (55.2 female) with a mean age of 78 years (standard deviation 5, range 70 -91) and mean number of years of education 14.5 (standard deviation 3.5). The mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 128 and 78 mmHg (standard deviations 10 and 7.1 respectively). PI in each examined artery are summarized in Fig. 1. Mean values of PI vary across arteries and generally increase in more distal arterial segments.\nCorrelation coefficients between all pairs of PIs are presented in Table 1. Overall, the correlations are modest with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.66 detected between the left and the right PCAs suggesting that PIs from different arteries do not provide identical information. Table 1 shows that PI in the right PCA exhibits highest correlations with that in the other vessels while PI in the BA -the lowest.\nThe pulsatility indices were not found to correlate with age as summarized in Table 2. This is consistent with the earlier work showing only a weak correlation of PI with age in a larger sample of EAS participants 34.\nClusters of voxels where FA is significantly correlated with age are shown in Fig. 2. A total of 23 clusters are detected, 19 exhibiting negative correlation (older age is associated with lower FA) and 4 positive. The total volumes of these sets are 11665mm 3 and 1520mm 3 respectively. The summary of clusters with significant correlations between PI and FA is given in Table 3. Both positive and negative correlations are observed with negative correlations (higher PI is associated with lower FA) prevailing. Clusters with positive correlations did not intersected with clusters where FA is associated with age. Overlap of clusters with negative correlations and those in the age analysis is summarized in the last column of Table 3.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study we demonstrated that pulsatility index in the cerebral arteries is correlated with FA, an early marker of WM integrity 14. Further, the relation of PI to FA depends on artery and brain region. Because correlations among pulsatility indexes measured in each of the main cerebral arteries were modest (Table 1), analytic approaches that average their values across vessels to reduce noise, improve precision andor to reduce the number of variables may dilute associations of PI and FA. Moreover, averaging may be performed in different ways yielding different effects on information: (i) average velocity time series across the vessels before extracting global PSV, EDV and MFV followed by applying the Gosling equation, (ii) average PSV, EDV and MFV extracted from each vessel prior to applying the Gosling equation and (iii) average PIs from each vessel 7,12,13,35.\nPrior studies have reported inconsistent results for the association between PI and white matter measures (FA andor WMHI) 7,12,13,35. Our results suggest that this may be due to the fact that PIs in different vessels carry different information and that prior studies employed different methods of PI and spatial averaging. Other methodological differences, such as choice of b-value for DTI acquisition, may also be important. We used b-value800secmm 2 because prior studies demonstrated this to be close to the optimal diffusion weighting for precise diffusion estimation 36,37.\nUnlike previous work, we considered PI from each artery independently and used a voxelwise approach to determine which areas of white matter exhibit significant associations between PI and FA (Table 3, Figure 3). Analyses of PIs in the right VA and left MCA yield the largest number of clusters with the largest total volume where elevated PI is associated with lower FA. We pay particular attention to these negative correlations because at least one component mechanism of white matter degeneration, demyelination, manifests as lower than normal FA 38 and is associated with both aging and cognitive decline 39. We, therefore, also determined areas where age-related decline in FA is significant (Figure 2) and found that overlap of these areas with those related to PIs is small, less than 13.3 (last column in Table 3). The largest overlap is with areas related to PI in left PCA. We conclude that areas of microstructural changes in WM related to elevated PI can not be explained by the agerelated changes identified in prior research 394041, because age was one of the covariates in PI -FA analysis and because overlap between areas where FA is associated with both PI and age is small. Conversely, prior studies reporting age-related changes in FA without regard to PI remain valid because PI appears to be an independent factor. And finally, PI is not likely a mediator of relationship of age to FA in this age group because of the very low correlation between age and PI (Table 2).\nWhite matter areas where low FA is associated with elevated PI are not found to be limited to the vascular territory of the vessel where PI is assessed. For example, elevated PI in the left MCA is associated with lower FA regions within both the left and right hemispheres in Figure 3. This suggests that linkage between elevated PI and reduced FA is not through a direct downstream perfusion deficit within the territory of the affected artery. It is difficult, however, to establish the exact mechanism linking PI to white matter changes because interpretation of PI is confounded by the sensitivity of the index to blood pressure, pulse rate, interplay of stiffness of vessels distal and proximal to the measurement site, microvascular resistance, blood viscosity, and in the case of cerebral circulation to intracranial pressure 16,42. Nevertheless, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that microstructural changes are caused by increased mechanical waves emanating from pulsating vessel walls and traveling without much attenuation within the brain 43. In this scenario we do not expect PI in an individual artery to be related to microstructural changes in regions specific to the arterial vascular territory. At the same time, we observe some spatial relation because elevated PI in different arteries is associated with reduced FA in essentially disjoint regions. Shear waves with their few centimeter wavelengths in the white matter at low frequencies could be the mechanistic basis for pulsatility-related white matter damage 44.\nA potential limitation of this study and its conclusions is the fact that not all study subjects were eligible for or volunteered for MRI, potentially resulting in selection bias. However, care was taken to include subjects representative of the full Einstein Aging Study cohort. Indeed, at the time of the EAS enrollment, the sample of subjects who subsequently underwent MRI and TCD was slightly younger (75.1 versus 77.0 years), had a lower proportion of women (55.1 versus 66.8) but similar years of education and raceethnicity characteristics compared to the full EAS cohort 17.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "In normal elderly subjects, elevated PI is related to lower FA, a marker of degraded white matter integrity. Areas of reduced FA are not limited to the vascular territory of the artery where PI is assessed and are distinct from areas with age-related FA changes. This suggests that elevated PI is a potential marker of low FA, independent of aging, but not necessarily as an indication of diminished perfusion. Instead, we support earlier implications of pulse wave injury to white matter 12,43, which can be detected using low cost, portable and noninvasive TCD. Clusters of voxels with significant correlations of FA and age. Clusters with negative correlations where older age is associated with lower FA are marked in red. Those with positive correlations -in yellow. Clusters of voxels (red) with significant correlations of FA and pulsatility index in left MCA. All correlations were negative: higher pulsatility is associated with lower FA. See Table 3 for summary of clusters in all examined arteries.",

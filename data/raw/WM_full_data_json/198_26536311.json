    "Conclusion:": {
      "text": "Longitudinal diffusion analysis indicates widespread microstructural deterioration of the normal-appearing white matter in normal aging, with relative sparing of sensorimotor fibers.\nNEURORADIOLOGY: White Matter Degeneration with Aging de Groot et al describes the directionality of diffusion, and a lower value typically reflects reduced microstructural organization in regions where white matter fibers are aligned. MD represents the overall magnitude of water diffusion, and a higher value generally reflects reduced microstructural organization (3). Reduced microstructural white matter organization possibly impedes communication within and between neurocognitive networks, which might result in cognitive impairment (4). To identify persons at higher risk of neurodegenerative disease, it is important to quantify changes in brain tissue at an early stage (5). This, however, also requires characterization of baseline agerelated changes.\nThe quantitative nature makes DTI very suitable for longitudinal analyses, which are likely to be more sensitive in the early detection of changes in white matter microstructure. However, longitudinal data are still scarce, and studies are mostly performed with small sample sizes and in patients with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (6)(7)(8)(9). The sparse longitudinal findings in persons experiencing normal aging did, however, corroborate evidence from cross-sectional studies that showed that during normal aging, white matter shows lower FA, with lessuniform observations for regions with crossing fibers, combined with higher MD (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11), and that those aging effects differ across brain regions (8,9,12,13). However, these results need to be corroborated in larger longitudinal studies.\nThus, in the current study, we aimed to longitudinally determine the rate of change in DTI parameters of white matter microstructure in aging and to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors influence this longitudinal change (14,15).",

      "text": "t has been recognized that both gray matter loss and white matter deterioration play an important role in brain aging and cognitive decline (1), and a vascular etiologic pathway has often been hypothesized (2). Diffusiontensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that enables measurement of diffusion of water and can be used to quantify subtle changes of white matter tissue organization that are not visible at structural MR imaging. DTI provides multiple descriptors of diffusion, with fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) most widely used. FA were estimated by using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt estimator, available in ExploreDTI (22). FA and MD, measures of tissue microstructure, were computed from the diffusion tensor images. Tensor fits were inspected for artifacts by reviewing axial sections of the FA images (M.d.G., a researcher with 5 years of experience in diffusion image analysis; L.G.M.C., a radiologistin-training with 2 years of experience in diffusion image analysis).",

Intracranial volume (ICV) (excluding the cerebellum with surrounding cerebrospinal fluid) was estimated by summing total gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid volumes.

Mean age at baseline MR imaging was 69.9 years (range, 64.1-91.1 years), and 253 (50.5) participants were MD over the entire skeleton per subject, excluding voxels labeled as WML at baseline examination. We assessed whether there was a global change in diffusion measurements with multiple linear regression by using three models. In model For the localized TBSS analyses, we performed voxelwise multiple linear regression analysis for the same models as the global analyses, also restricting the analyses to the (baseline) normalappearing white matter. If significant associations were found for tests in model 3, we additionally performed an analysis correcting for measures of macrostructural white matter degeneration to rule out confounding by white matter atrophy and WML. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement (26) with default settings for skeletonized data to promote spatially clustered findings and controlled the family-wise error rate by using a permutation-based approach (using 5000 permutations) (27). All analyses were performed by using an in-house-adapted version of the original TBSS method (23,24). This registration approach is described in Appendix E1 (online). All registrations were inspected by reviewing axial compilations of superpositioned moving and target images (M.d.G., L.G.M.C.). After registration, individual change in diffusion measures could be computed in standard space (Montreal Neurological Institute 152 template, as provided with the FSL software 25) by subtracting baseline images from follow-up images.\nA study-specific white matter skeleton was constructed by using the TBSS skeletonization procedure on the average FA image composed of all subject images at both time points combined in standard space, thresholding the FA skeleton at 0.25. This skeleton was then used to mask the difference images for longitudinal statistical analysis.",

    "Statistical Analysis": {
      "text": "Changes in diffusion characteristics were assessed both globally and locally by using skeletonized difference measurements. For global analysis, we investigated the average change in FA and For model 1, we observed associations between age and FA (decrease) or MD (increase) in 44 of the skeleton voxels (for FA, P mean  .03; for MD, P mean  .02). These associations were reduced both in strength and in extent (changes in age resulted in an additional increase in MD) but were not associated with changes in FA.\nVoxelwise analyses, seen in Figure 2 for model 2, revealed a decrease in FA of, on average, 0.0082 (P mean  .002) in 57 of the white matter skeleton over the follow-up interval. However, in most of the sensorimotor tracts, FA paradoxically increased by 0.0078 (P mean  .009), on average. Change over time for models 1 and 2 was not materially different. Increase in FA was found in the sensorimotor tracts extending from the brain stem through the internal capsule (both the anterior female. The global analyses, corrected for age, sex, imaging interval, and ICV, showed an average decrease of 0.0042 (P , .001) for FA in the normal-appearing white matter skeleton and an average increase of 8.1 3 10 26 mm 2 sec (P , .001) for MD over the follow-up interval (model 1). The same changes were observed when we additionally controlled for white matter atrophy and WML load (model 2). As shown in Table 2, these two additional confounding variables also were associated with changes in MD (ie, higher WML load, less normalappearing white matter, and higher NEURORADIOLOGY: White Matter Degeneration with Aging de Groot et al local differences were more prominent in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere and occurred primarily in the centrum semiovale and in the white matter adjacent to the trigone of the lateral ventricle. In contrast, we observed lower MD only in a small peritrigonal cluster in carriers compared with noncarriers. These observed associations persisted when we additionally corrected for macrostructural measures of white matter characteristics was observed for men or women. In yellow to red regions, there is a decrease in FA that relates to higher age at baseline (adjusted for sex, imaging interval, and ICV). Middle rows: FA changes that are associated with a decrease in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) volume and an increase in WML volume. (Both were adjusted for age, sex, imaging interval, and ICV). Bottom row: Regions of decrease in FA related to older age, when additionally adjusted for normal-appearing white matter volume and WML volume. Inverse directions of association showed no significant voxels (not shown). Results shown are significant (P , .05); the family-wise error rate was controlled by using a permutation approach. P values are shown in Figure E3 (online). Results are overlaid on a population-specific average FA image in standard space coordinates and show nonsignificant normal-appearing white matter skeleton voxels in black. degeneration. Similarly, we observed that APOE 4 carriers had a smaller global increase in MD (Table 3). Total serum cholesterol level was associated locally with a greater increase in MD in the left hemisphere. Regions included the corona radiata and white matter around the posterior and anterior horns of the lateral ventricle. These observed associations persisted when additionally correcting for macrostructural measures of white matter degeneration. Other cardiovascular risk factors were associated with neither global nor local changes in tissue microstructure. Results for global DTI characteristics are presented in Table 3.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this large population-based longitudinal sample of elderly persons, we found changes to microstructural tissue organization congruent with microstructural white matter deterioration. Over a 2-year follow-up interval, loss of microstructure was globally reflected in decreases in FA and increases in MD, independent of severity of white matter atrophy and WML load. On a voxelwise level, we found regional differences in white matter changes, with decreased FA in most of the brain but increased FA in most of the sensorimotor pathway running from the brain stem up to the motor cortex. In contrast, MD was increased throughout the white matter skeleton, without any NEURORADIOLOGY: White Matter Degeneration with Aging de Groot et al micro-and macrostructural (ie, tract thinning) changes (32). We did observe counterintuitive associations with APOE 4 carriership. Globally, we observed a decrease in MD in APOE 4 carriers compared with that in noncarriers. Locally, we observed increases in FA in APOE 4 carriers in comparison with FA in noncarriers in regions with a high prevalence of WML. These observations are in contrast to the findings of cross-sectional studies with APOE genotype that have generally shown widespread deterioration of white matter microstructure associated with the 4 allele (33,34). On closer inspection, this paradoxical increase in FA was largely explained by lower baseline FA in carriers and a larger decrease in FA in noncarriers. Higher serum cholesterol level was associated with stronger increases in MD over time in the left hemisphere. When we investigated other cardiovascular risk factors, we observed associations with neither global nor local changes to white matter microstructure; this finding was in line with the findings of another longitudinal study (6) but was in disagreement with cross-sectional observations (2,35). These discrepancies, both for APOE and for cardiovascular factors, might have been due to the relatively short follow-up interval, which translates in the (clustered) voxelwise and global statistics being relatively underpowered. Another possibility is that changes induced by cardiovascular risk factors may be more prominent in the periphery of white matter tracts, whereas the TBSS method focused on tract centers. Most importantly however, our longitudinal design only probes differential effects and not the difference accumulated over the total exposure time, which precludes the analysis from finding subtle differential changes with cardiovascular risk factors.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the relatively short follow-up interval may have limited sensitivity to detect differences over time, especially in the case of differential effects with risk factors (as mentioned previously). This meant we could not disambiguate characterize change over time, have revealed reductions in FA and increases in MD (6,9). Our findings enable us to confirm many of these longitudinal and cross-sectional findings and to extend on these for the normal-appearing white matter in a larger population.\nIn the sensorimotor pathway, we identified a seemingly paradoxical increase of FA, which may have been related to partial volume mixing of multiple fiber tracts (eg, crossing or touching fibers) within these voxels. Selective degeneration of one fiber bundle with relative sparing of the other bundle may lead to an increase in FA, with a concomitant increase in MD. This effect was previously observed in a study on Wallerian degeneration (28) and was described in detail in a cross-sectional study on Alzheimer disease (29). The increased FA, ascending from the brain stem through the internal capsule and the corona radiata up into the motor cortex (ie, regions with either crossing fibers or closely spaced adjacent fibers 30,31) seems to indicate a relative sparing of sensorimotor fibers. Inside the fornix, we found the strongest increase in MD. This may reflect loss of microstructural organization in this limbic fiber, but we should note that this tract is small compared with our imaging matrix and is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, these findings likely represent a combination of significant decreases. We found that white matter deterioration was locally more pronounced with higher age, indicating that older persons show more change in white matter microstructure over the same follow-up time than do younger persons. This could partly be explained by macroscopic measures of white matter degeneration (ie, white matter atrophy and WML load), which also increase with age. We identified only a few associations between known (cardiovascular) determinants of white matter atrophy and WML load and changes in diffusion characteristics over time, both globally and locally. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related brain changes and may aid in the future identification of early abnormalities leading to disease.\nCross-sectional studies of normal aging of white matter generally have shown lower FA and higher MD with higher age (1,11,12), which is in line with our results. In a cross-sectional analysis of an earlier time point in the same population, we found a similar effect with age itself (ie, most of the associations with age were driven by macroscopic measures of white matter degeneration) (10). Both results indicate that white matter degeneration with aging is not intrinsically due to aging alone, nor is it purely driven by macroscopic measures of white matter degeneration. Longitudinal analyses, which are necessary to reliably the risk factor-related changes from the large changes associated with aging. This also impeded direct translation of our findings to individual subjects (eg, for use in clinical care).\nSecond, the study protocol was defined in 2005 and 2006; therefore, the spatial resolution for the diffusion acquisition was relatively poor for current standards (23). Although use of TBSS mitigated partial volume effects in the major white matter tracts and although we adjusted for overall white matter atrophy, the resolution reduced sensitivity to detect change in very thin tracts. Nevertheless, we identified widespread deterioration of white matter microstructure within the studied interval. Third, we excluded participants with dementia at either time point, but we did not exclude persons with mild cognitive impairment, since mild cognitive impairment contributes to the continuous spectrum of age-related diseases that we aimed to investigate. This may have led to inclusion of some persons with preclinical dementia, which could have affected our results.\nIn conclusion, in this large longitudinal analysis of brain white matter microstructure in normal aging, we found widespread microstructural deterioration of the normal-appearing white matter, with relative sparing of sensorimotor fibers. We found changes to be more prominent in older persons. This finding was partly explained by concomitant macroscopic white matter damage. Cardiovascular risk factors did not generally relate to white matter microstructure. These insights into white matter degeneration in aging may help us to understand the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.",

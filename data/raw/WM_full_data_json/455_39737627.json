    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is sensitive to the microstructural properties of brain tissues and shows great promise in detecting the effects of degenerative diseases. However, many approaches analyze single measures averaged over regions of interest without considering the underlying fiber geometry. METHODS: We propose a novel macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT) framework to investigate how white matter (WM) microstructure and macrostructure are jointly altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We compared MINT-derived metrics with univariate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to examine how fiber geometry may impact the interpretation of microstructure. RESULTS: In two multisite cohorts from North America and India, we find consistent patterns of microstructural and macrostructural anomalies implicated in MCI and dementia; we also rank diffusion metrics sensitivity to dementia.",

    "BACKGROUND": {
      "text": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is often used to investigate the microstructure and geometry of the brains neural pathways. 1,2 As water diffusion is constrained along these pathways, tractography can reconstruct the 3D geometry of the brains major fiber bundles from dMRI signals. Pathological processes in degenerative diseases, such as the loss of neurons and myelin and inflammation, affect tissue diffusion properties, resulting in changes to tissue microstructure and pathway geometry. Because of this, dMRI is sensitive to pathological processes that are not detectable with standard anatomical MRI.\nAnisotropy and diffusivity measures computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used to characterize white matter (WM) microstructural properties. As many types of molecular pathology influence the dMRI signal, including amyloid and tau protein accumulation in the brain, numerous studies have focused on charting WM anomalies in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), 345 Parkinsons disease, 6 and other dementias. DTI metrics have been found to be associated with age and dementia severity, 4,7 particularly in the cingulum, fornix, and corpus callosum. A followup study 5 found that cortical dMRI metrics mediated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD and delayed logical memory performance, which is typically impaired in early AD.\nLower CSF amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ142) and higher phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181) were associated with cortical dMRI measures reflecting less restricted diffusion; this apparent link between AD pathology and diffusion metrics has bolstered interest in using dMRI to study AD. Even so, standard analysis methods typically reduce microstructural indices to summaries over relatively large regions of interest. These limitations have stimulated efforts to map disease effects on brain microstructure along WM tracts at a finer anatomical scale. 5,8,9 DTI-based metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AxD) are contaminated by the presence of multiple fiber populations in a single voxel 10,11 and not specific to any individual fiber population. While voxel-based, fixel-based, 12 and tractometry approaches have been proposed to help resolve crossing fibers, microstructural measures are still calculated at the voxel level.\nCurrent tractometry methods often compute statistics for each bundle separately using a univariate approach without accounting for the complex pattern of intersecting fibers in the brain. Tractography data can also be used to study the macrostructural or shape properties of WM bundles. In a large multisite cohort of elderly adults, Schilling et al. 13 found heterogeneous patterns of age-related WM macrostructural changes compared to the more homogeneous microstructural changes across bundles. A recent study 14 found that early tau-related WM changes in AD may be due to fiber macrostructure using fixelbased analysis. To our knowledge, no work has examined how WM micro-and macrostructure are jointly altered in neurodegenerative conditions such as AD using tractometry methods, which we address in the current study.\nThis study proposes macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT)  to jointly model microstructural measures and cooccurring variations in bundle geometry with a variational autoencoder (VAE). When used as a normative model, VAE can encode normal variability for diffusion metrics in healthy controls. This multivariate model integrates multiple complementary microstructural features and accounts for the statistical covariance among different dMRI metrics as well as along-tract spatial correlations. We compare MINTderived measures with traditional univariate measures derived from DTI to investigate characteristic patterns of WM abnormalities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in a large multisite sample.\nWe also examine how WM abnormalities relate to clinical measures of dementia severity. As there is interest in identifying the microstructural metrics useful for detecting and tracking dementia, we also rank DTI metrics by evaluating their sensitivity to dementia. After visualizing WM microstructural abnormalities in dementia and MCI in two cohorts of different ancestry and demographics, we examine how they relate to overall tract geometry, noting ambiguities of interpretation that can be resolved by joint statistical modeling of microstructure and shape.",

    "Bundle segmentation": {
      "text": "For all ADNI, NIMHANS, and the TractoInferno datasets, we used the bundle analytics (BUAN) tractometry framework 8 for bundle segmentation, subsequent bundle profiling, harmonization, and statistics (detailed in Sections 2.3.3 and 2.4). DiPys 25 autocalibrated RecoBundles method 8,40 was used to segment 30 WM bundles using the population-averaged HCP-842 atlas 41 in both the native and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Figure 1 and Section S3). These 30 bundles have been successfully reconstructed in single-shell dMRI data from participants with Parkinsons disease and bipolar disorder. 8,42 The autocalibration step 8 performs additional pruning and can help reduce false positives and extract bundles of various shapes and sizes without manually tuning parameters. Bundles with fewer than 96 streamlines were removed. In MINT, we use 1D convolutional layers to model streamline-level information. This method was proposed to enforce sequential dependency of 3D points along a streamline. 43 Illustrated in Figure 2A, a 1D convolution learns from local neighborhood points along a streamline using a sliding window, and multiple convolutional layers can be stacked to learn information from points farther away. This approach has been successfully applied to problems such as streamline filtering, clustering, 43,44 and generative sampling of streamlines for bundle segmentation. 45 MINT can learn the patterns of statistical variation in whole-brain macrostructure by training it on streamlines (3D curves) from multiple bundles. While prior studies used the term macrostructure to describe bundle-level shape information, here we use this term to describe the overall, whole-brain fiber geometry derived from tractography (including information from multiple bundles). We illustrate this in Figure 2B We then perform model inference on all data from the target dataset to obtain their reconstruction for subsequent bundle profiling. For each bundle, the point-wise deviation score (MAE) is indexed using 100 along-tract segments created to align data across subjects. MAE for all points within each segment is averaged to create a bundle profile of deviation scores. The BUAN statistical framework is used for harmonization and group difference testing. In the harmonization step, bundle profiles created from data in Split 1 are used to train ComBat, 35,36 the distribution of the training data and can serve as a normative baseline when calculated on healthy controls. We expected the reconstruction error to be higher for data with abnormalities. This tactic of using reconstruction error from a VAE, or a related generative model, has been widely employed for anomaly detection in both biomedical and industrial contexts. 464748 Next, we created along-tract segments aligned across subjects to localize tract-specific deviations. The methods to create along-tract profiles for these deviations are detailed in Section 2.3.3.",

DTI metrics, FA, MD, RD, and AxD, were projected onto the corresponding bundle in the native space. Each streamline was resampled to 128 equidistant points -so that the resulting set of points could be used with 1D convolutional layers -with seven input features -x, y, z, FA, MD, RD, and AxD. To preserve the spatial relationships between streamlines within each subject, unit sphere normalization was applied to the 3D coordinates for all streamlines in each subjects bundles, using a centroid and radius calculated from the HCP-842 atlas tractogram. 41 Min-max scaling was applied to each of the four DTI metrics using preset ranges, and all seven input features were scaled between -1 and 1. As streamlines are also flip-independent -that is, one streamline can be traversed in either direction -we performed random flipping as an augmentation step 45 to further enforce this property, although 1D convolution can learn information from neighboring points in both directions.\nAs the VAE model was used here in a normative model setting, we need to be careful not to overparameterize the model to avoid reconstructing anomalies at inference time.

To compare the MAE scores with the original DTI microstructural measures, we also calculated the mean along-tract profile M as follows:\nwhere the features contain four DTI measures. For each subjects bundle, X, we created along-tract profiles for a total of nine features: MAE scores were calculated for five features at 100 along-tract segments, Along-tract bundle profiles for all nine features were harmonized using ComBat using the bundle-wise approach described in Chandio et al. 15 ComBat is a location and scale model, where we assume that each measurement is affected by the additive and multiplicative effects of the scanner and protocol, 15,53 The estimated ComBat parameters were then applied to bundle profiles from the test set, which included CN and subjects with MCI and dementia, for subsequent statistical analysis.",

A linear regression model was fitted for each of the 100 segments in 30 bundles with harmonized diffusion metrics modeled as the dependent variable, and diagnosis (DX), age, and sex as independent variables (MAE  Age  Sex  DX, M  Age  Sex  DX). The CN group was used as the reference group against which we compared MCI and dementia. Linear regression was fitted separately for each cohort to compare MCI and dementia effects between ADNI and NIMHANS. We corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method 19 applied to 3000 tests across the whole brain. We then repeated this procedure on bundle profiles for the dementia group with MCI as the reference. We also conducted an additional analysis on diffusion measures from the merged cohorts.\nAlthough DTI and MAE measures were harmonized with ComBat across all nine protocols, regional differences in demographics and cognitive assessments across cohorts might have affected diagnosis.\nInstead of a linear regression, we fitted a linear mixed model for the merged analysis where cohort was modeled as a random effect, and age, sex, and DX were modeled as fixed effects. Only bundle profiles from the test set were used for statistical analysis in this step and Section 2.5.\nThere is considerable interest in determining which dMRI-derived metrics are most effective in picking up subtle and distributed effects of the disease in the brain. As the statistics are defined at multiple locations along a tract, we then used a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot to gauge how much of the tract shows significance and at what level.\nThese plots are cumulative histograms of the p values of association between dementia diagnosis and diffusion metrics for all segments in a tract from the linear regression model. If a curve rises sharply from the origin in the Q-Q plot, it means that a large proportion of the tract has very low p values.

All visualizations in these figures were created using the FURY package. 25,57,58 As expected from the intensification and spread of disease pathology of MCI and dementia, we see greater effects of dementia than MCI in almost all WM regions for all nine measures compared to CN. Overall, mean diffusivity (MD), which is commonly reported as increased in dementia, was higher in MCI and higher still in dementia. Consistent with the temporal lobe atrophy, that is, typical of both MCI and dementia, the abnormal elevation in MD showed the strongest effects in the temporal lobe pathways (inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), temporal uncinate fasciculus (UF), and arcuate fasciculus (AF) bundles), and in the corpus callosum at the midline.\nFor both DTI and MAE diffusivity measures in general, higher MD (Figure 3), RD, and AxD (Section S4.1) were found in dementia and MCI compared to control participants. Lower DTI-FA (Figure 4A), higher MAE-FA (Figure 4B), and higher MAE-Shape (denoting a bundles geometrical distortion compared to its normal configuration learned from the VAE model; Figure 5) are found in dementia and MCI compared to CN in most brain regions. For all MAE metrics, these findings are consistent with our expectation that statistical deviation from the norm is greater in the MCI and dementia groups than in the CN group.\nTrends and directions of deviation for DTI metrics are also consistent with prior reports on regional DTI measures in AD. 7,59606162 Patterns of dementia and MCI effects were also mostly consistent across the two cohorts we examined, with stronger statistical significance in ADNI compared to NIMHANS.\nFor MAE-MD and DTI-MD, we see widespread effects of dementia across the whole brain, with the largest effects in the posterior and temporal regions, including the OPT and OR bundles in the projection pathways, the ILF, posterior regions of the MdLF and EMC and temporal regions of the UF and AF bundles in the association pathways, and the forceps major in the commissural pathways. The patterns are largely similar for both DTI-MD and MAE-MD and across the two cohorts. We see smaller effects in NIMHANS than ADNI, except for the brainstem bundles -where effects could be inflated due to the ComBat harmonization (Section S5).\nWithout considering crossing fibers, the overall diffusivity can be decomposed into a diffusivity along the axons (AxD) and a component transverse to axons (RD). In the context of neurodegeneration, the latter is increased when cell membranes are damaged, neurons are lost, or myelin degrades. MCI and dementia effects on MAE-RD were similar to those found for MAE-MD in all regions, whereas their effects on MAE-AxD and MAE-MD are more similar in some bundles in the association, brainstem, and projection pathways. The ADNI cohort showed greater MCI and dementia effects with stronger significance for the three MAE diffusivity measures in most regions relative to the NIMHANS cohort.",

We compared the four DTI-derived measures with their corresponding MINT-derived measures, as well as MAE-Shape.\nFor the ADNI cohort, both the DTI and MAE diffusivity measures were very similar in their associations with CDRsb (Figure 6A), MMSE, and ADAS13 (Section S6.1), where each metric showed a significant positive correlation in most bundles, except IFOF_L and V. MAE diffusivity measures aligned most with DTI measures for MD, followed by RD and AxD, where the association with RD measures was slightly higher for MAE in the association and projection pathways, and the association with AxD measures was slightly lower for MAE in the projection pathways.\nFor the NIMHANS cohort, however, MAE diffusivity measures showed a significant negative correlation with WLDR in more bundles than DTI measures (Figure 6B). The differences between the corresponding DTI and MAE diffusivity measures were more prominent than those for CDRsb in the ADNI cohort. Significant negative correlations with WLDR for MAE-MD and MAE-RD were widespread in the posterior and temporal association pathways (EMC, ILF, and MdLF), posterior projection pathways (FPT, OPT, and OR), and corpus callosum. Significant associations with SMDR (Section S6.2) -although less widespread compared to WLDR -were seen in more bundles for MAE-MD and MAE-RD compared to the corresponding DTI measures.\nSince we expected DTI-FA to be lower and MAE-FA to be higher in participants with greater cognitive impairment, correlations for these two measures had opposite signs for many bundles. There was a weak correlation between MAE-FA and all clinical metrics, lower than that for DTI-FA in most bundles, except for EMC and FPT, where associations with CDRsb and ADAS13 were comparable or higher. No bundle, except for the forceps minor, exhibited significant correlation between FA measures with WLDR and SMIR. Notably, MAE-Shape showed a significant positive correlation with CDRsb, MMSE, and ADAS13 in the association and projection pathways and a significant negative correlation with WLDR in EMC_L, OPT, MLF, and STT_L. Overall, EMC showed statistically significant associations with more clinical metrics in more diffusion measures than any other bundles, followed by OPT and forceps minor.\nOverall, MAE measures were comparable to DTI measures in their associations with clinical metrics for the ADNI cohort. MAE-MD and MAE-RD outperformed the corresponding DTI measures in their association with episodic memory for the NIMHANS cohort. For metrics from both cohorts, MAE-Shape was comparable to DTI-FA in their association with clinical metrics, indicating that macrostructural changes may be associated with neurodegeneration pathologies.",

      "text": "To evaluate how DTI-and MINT-derived measures differed in detecting group differences, we display a Q-Q plot of-log 10 (P) for the dementia versus CN comparison in the ADNI cohort in Figure 7. We selected ILF_L, OPT_L, and CC_ForcepsMajor -three WM bundles from each association, projection, and commissural pathways -which showed significant dementia effects in most along-tract diffusion measures (Section 3.1). For both DTI-and MINT-derived measures, MD and RD (shown in orange and green colors) associated most strongly with dementia compared to AxD and FA for all three bundles. This is consistent with prior work examining dMRI metrics in regions of interest, where MD and RD typically showed the strongest association with dementia. 7 The ranking of DTI-AxD and DTI-FA differed by bundle, with DTI-AxD being more sensitive to dementia effects than DTI-FA in OPT_L and less in CC_ForcepsMajor. For MAE measures, however, MAE-FA was the weakest at detecting dementia effects in all bundles, followed by MAE-Shape and MAE-AxD. MAE-Shape outperformed both MAE-FA and MAE-AxD in OPT_L and CC_ForcepsMajor. These findings might indicate that metrics describing diffusion along the principal direction of axons (FA and AxD) may be more prone to crossing fibers and macrostructural changes (characterized by MAE-Shape) than MD and RD. We also observed that the difference in statistical significance between corresponding MAE and DTI measures varied across bundles, where the p values changed most, and for most measures, for CC_ForcepsMajor compared to ILF_L and OPT_L. These differences may reflect a bundles sensitivity to macrostructural changes, which is accounted for in MINT, as some variations in DTI metrics may be explained away by MAE-Shape. While MAE-MD and MAE-RD remained most sensitive to dementia effects compared to other MINTderived measures, they were less sensitive than their DTI counterparts for CC_ForcepsMajor and OPT_L. If macrostructural changes were disentangled from such compound measures, it could be expected that MAE measures might have a lower sensitivity to dementia for some bundles. In ILF_L, on the other hand, multivariate modeling of DTI and whole-brain fiber geometry showed comparable performance in detecting dementia effects on MD and RD with univariate modeling and could boost sensitivity for AxD measures.",

    "Microstructural brain abnormalities in dementia and MCI": {
      "text": "In this study, we proposed the MINT framework for mapping microand macrostructural WM abnormalities using a joint multivariate model. Our novel method contrasts with the univariate approach used in existing tractometry methods, where metrics defined on each tract are considered without reference to other related metrics in the rest of the brain.  We investigated group differences in dMRIderived metrics in subjects with dementia and MCI, relative to matched healthy controls, for both North American and Indian cohorts. We computed bundle profiles of the four widely used DTI measures and five MINT-derived measures quantifying deviations from the norm, corresponding to each DTI metric and an additional shape measure.\nOverall, diffusivity increased in MCI and further in dementia, with stronger abnormalities in the temporal lobe tracts and the corpus callosum. We detected widespread and largely similar patterns of abnormalities across two cohorts with stronger statistical significance for disease effects in ADNI than NIMHANS. Of all DTI-derived metrics, MD was the most sensitive to dementia, followed by RD, AxD, and FA. Patterns of dementia and MCI effects on MD were also consistent across univariate and multivariate approaches. This aligns with our understanding that MD is less susceptible to crossing fibers, and macrostructural changes are linked to variations in FA more than MD. Microstructural metrics that are associated most strongly with dementia are typically MD and RD, shown in orange and green colors. The dashed line in these plots shows the pattern of p values that would be expected for null measures, that is, brain metric that shows no association with dementia. For some tracts, the MAE-FA is not much better than a null measure (ie, shows no detectable association with dementia). ADNI  Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. CN, cognitively normal; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; FDR, false discovery rate; MAE-FA, mean absolute error-fractional anisotropy; MINT, macrostructure-informed normative tractometry; QQ, quantile-quantile; RD, radial diffusivity.\nAreas showing higher DTI-FA in dementia and MCI largely corresponded to areas with lower macrostructural anomalies characterized by MAE-Shape, except for the bilateral OPT tracts. This paradoxical pattern of FA was previously reported in dementia and MCI by Nir et al. 7 and Douaud et al. 63 in regional DTI analyses. In healthy aging, FA has also been found to have no detectable association -or even a paradoxical, positive association with age -in the projection fibers. 646566 Using fixel-based analysis, Han et al. 67 reported fiber-specific age associations in healthy adults and found evidence of selective WM degeneration. This fan-shaped pattern in the projection pathways in our findings was likely due to the fiber crossings near the corona radiata and the centrum semiovale. The complex fiber configurations in the commissural and U-fibers, compared to the more homogeneous fiber organization in the deep proximal regions, may contribute to this spatially varying pattern in the long-range projection pathways.\nWhile such fiber crossings would presumably exist in healthy controls, we found that this pattern was enhanced in dementia and MCI in both cohorts after accounting for age and sex effects. In a voxel-wise DTI analysis, Racine et al. 68 reported higher FA in the cingulum and fornix in preclinical AD subjects who were amyloid positive. FA is a composite measure and is not a reliable metric for interpreting fiber integrity. 11 For similar reasons, RD and AxD are also susceptible to fiber crossings, where changes in one measure can lead to spurious changes in the other. 69 When studying neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, where the underlying pathology may affect the biophysical properties of WM, the effects of fiber crossing can overshadow (and be confounded with) disease-related microstructural changes in FA, AxD, and RD, when considered independently. Our novel MINT framework accounts for whole-brain macrostructure using tractography in a multivariate model. This may help to disentangle intrinsic changes in DTI measures from signals affected by crossing fibers, to better reflect the underlying pathology. While FA is the metric that is most correlated with alterations in WM macrostructure -and few regions pass the statistical significance threshold compared to univariate DTI measures -MINT still identified widespread abnormalities in RD and AxD in dementia and MCI and higher correlation with cognitive measures compared to DTI values in some WM regions. Although MD is less prone to the effect of crossing fibers than other DTI metrics, we note that it is susceptible to partial volume effect. In WM regions close to the ventricles, such as the forceps major, CSF may contribute to changes in MD that could be attributed to atrophy instead of WM microstructural changes. We will investigate multicompartment diffusion metrics such as free water 70 in the MINT framework in our future work to better account for various sources of signal in the multivariate model.",

Even in acquisitions with sufficient angular resolution for tractography, widely used tractography and segmentation pipelines systematically produce false positive streamlines. 71 For this study, we selected 30 bundles from a total of 80 bundles from the HCP-842 atlas. 8,41 State-of-theart fiber orientation reconstruction and tractography methods used in this study 33,35 can sufficiently reconstruct fibers from these bundles in single-shell dMRI acquisitions with low b-values. 72 However, some key bundles, such as the fornix and the cingulum, are difficult to reconstruct using automated methods due to their unique shape and location, 72,73 although the fornix is a key structure showing early changes in aging. 74 Even among the 30 bundles we used in this study, UF and IFOF bundles were not well reconstructed in all subjects across all protocols, which might have affected downstream harmonization and statistical analysis (Section S5). Skeleton-based methods such as TBSS, compared to tractometry, examine a relatively small subset of the brains anatomy. These methods can be more computationally and memory efficient, facilitating efficient large-scale international analyses such as those by the ENIGMA-DTI working group. 74,75 FA abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases are robustly reported in numerous studies, as are age effects across the human lifespan in normative models of vast international samples. 76,77 While FA, RD, and AxD are not specific indices of microstructural integrity per se, they are still useful for group comparisons and for detecting anomalies in acquisitions where the WM tracts of interest are difficult to reconstruct using tractography.",

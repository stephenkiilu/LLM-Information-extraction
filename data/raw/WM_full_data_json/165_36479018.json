    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Degeneration of subcortical white matter (WM) is increasingly recognized as a critical process of early Alzheimers disease (AD) pathophysiology, with some studies suggesting that WM degeneration may precede cortical atrophy. 12345 Given that neurodegeneration is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction in AD, the discovery and development of reliable and sensitive in-vivo markers for neurodegeneration are important goals of AD research, as these prospective measures may aid in the identification of cognitively unimpaired individuals who are at risk for developing AD in the future, as well as provide crucial information pertaining to the staging and progression of AD. 6 WM changes are commonly studied using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), a modality that operates by sensitizing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal to the diffusion of water molecules in the brain. The most prevalent DWI model used to study WM changes associated with AD is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 6 While DTI studies of AD have been informative, the model has known limitations, including providing limited information in regions with greater restricted (non-Gaussian) diffusion, such as that present within cellular structures. 7,8 An increasingly popular alternative to DTI applied in contemporary AD research is neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI). 9 NODDI is a biophysically-based model which characterizes brain changes in specific microstructural environments by assuming that the DWI signal emanates from 3 distinct tissue compartments:\nwithin neurites, outside of neurites, and free water. 9 The primary NODDI measures are the neurite density index (NDI -the signal fraction from within neurites), the orientation dispersion index (ODI -the degree of angular variation among neurites), and the isotropic volume fraction (ISO -the signal fraction from a free water compartment).\nNODDI has shown promise for evaluating neurodegeneration along the clinical continuum of AD, 101112 as well as alterations along the biological spectrum of AD pathology. 13 An alternative DWI model with minimal assumptions about tissue microstructure is mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI. 14,15 In MAP-MRI, the probability density function describing the displacements of diffusing water molecules is estimated directly from the DWI signal.\nMAP-MRI measures include the return to origin probability (RTOP), the return to axis probability (RTAP), the return to plane probability (RTPP), the mean squared displacement (MSD), the Non-Gaussianity (NG), and the q-space inverse variance (QIV). 14,15 RTOP quantifies the probability that a proton will remain in the same relative position in 3D space between 2 consecutive diffusion gradient pulses, and therefore, is a marker for tissue restriction. RTAP and RTPP are the 2D and 1D counterparts of RTOP and are sensitive to restrictive barriers perpendicular and parallel to the principal direction of diffusion, respectively.\nNG, which can similarly be decomposed into components that are perpendicular (NG  ) and parallel (NG  ) to the principal direction of diffusion, represents the fraction of the DWI signal that does not conform to a Gaussian distribution, and therefore, serves as a barometer for complex tissue organization. MSD, another indicator of tissue restriction, is a measure of how far diffusing water molecules travel between successive diffusion gradient pulses. Finally, QIV is a measure of the variance in the diffusion signal. 141516 Recently, MAP-MRI has been shown to be more useful than DTI for the evaluation of Parkinsons disease severity 17 as well as temporal lobe epilepsy lateralization. 18 Additionally, 1 study found evidence that MAP-MRI was sensitive to age-dependent amyloid burden in transgenic Alzheimer rats (TgF344-AD), 19 paving the way for future studies to explore the potential of MAP-MRI to identify AD-related microstructural changes in humans.\nIn order to investigate WM microstructural alterations associated with AD across the brain, we applied DTI, NODDI, and for the very first",

Of the 9 total associations between diffusion microstructural parameters and NfL, QIV and RTPP were the most prevalent, with 83.1 and 80.6 of WM skeleton voxels related for each metric, respectively (Table 2).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "While MRI investigations of neurodegeneration in AD have most commonly focused on gross macrostructural brain changes, such as reduced cortical volume and thickness, there is now considerable evidence to suggest that neurodegeneration can be captured with techniques sensitive to tissue microstructure along the AD continuum even prior to cortical atrophy. 13 Furthermore, studies have shown that degenerative WM microstructural changes, including axonal degeneration, demyelination, inflammation, and alterations in cellularity, are involved in AD and methods that measure these phenomena provide useful and complementary information related to the onset and progression of AD pathology. In this study, we used 3 distinct DWI techniques to identify widespread relationships between CSF markers of AD and DWI markers of WM degeneration along the AD continuum, which may suggest that little subcortical WM is spared from the effects of AD. to pTau (NG, NG  ). While the associations were much less extensive across the WM skeleton voxels of the brain, there remained 8 different DWI indices that had some significant sensitivity to CSF markers of AD pathology or neurodegeneration, among our preclinical cohort. Notably, the diffusion imaging sequences applied in this study can be acquired in under 10 min, 42 making the derivation of these metrics a clinically viable tool for early detection of AD-related neurodegeneration.",

    "MAP-MRI and NODDI may be sensitive to microstructural signatures of AD-related neurodegeneration": {
      "text": "In our study, MAP-MRI outperformed NODDI and DTI in detecting changes in CSF biomarkers of AD pathology and neurodegeneration across the WM fiber bundles of the brain. This may be a consequence of the fact that MAP-MRI metrics more directly relate to the microstructural features of brain tissue and characterize non-Gaussian diffusion profiles indicative of more complex tissue organization. Therefore, these markers may be especially sensitive to common neurodegenerative changes, including those central to AD pathology, such as axonal degeneration, demyelination, inflammation, and reductions in tissue cellularity.\nFor example, water diffusion is highly restricted within axons, dendrites, and cellular membranes and organelles, resulting in non-Gaussian diffusion. Decreased Non-Gaussianity (NG) from MAP-MRI suggests reduced tissue complexity and is likely a sensitive marker of axonal loss and demyelination, 15 which are 2 hallmark features of ADrelated WM degeneration. 43,44 NfL, which was predictive of NG, NG  , and NG  in our sample, is sensitive to both. 45,46 Moreover, NG  had a strikingly widespread association with α-synuclein, a presynaptic protein and known marker for synaptic degeneration. 22 In this context, it is likely that damaged synapses (in the cortices) are concurrently affecting nearby (subcortical) WM and that NG  , by detecting subtle increases in diffusion Gaussianity in the affected area, is sensitive to this damage. Additionally, higher Aβ 4240 levels in our sample were predictive of widespread increases in RTOP, suggesting that amyloid accumulation in AD is associated with pervasive reductions in tissue restriction.\nFurthermore, MAP-MRI and NODDI metrics exhibited widespread associations with pTauAβ 42 , and NfL. Notably, increases in both markers were predictive of extensive reductions in NDI, suggesting that reduced neurite density may be a characteristic feature of early AD pathology. These relationships pervaded association, commissural, projection and brainstem fiber bundles, spanning every lobule of the brain. While several studies of WM hyperintensities in AD have focused on frontal and temporal regions associated with memory and executive function, 474849 our results suggest that WM changes in early pre-symptomatic stagers of AD progression might be more widespread than is commonly appreciated. It is possible that the microstructural WM changes detected by DWI indices in this study are happening on a whole brain scale, in parallel with well-documented global atrophy of WM and gray matter structures.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "A few limitations should be noted. First, we are limited by our crosssectional study design. Ideally, we would have multiple CSF biomarker measurements and DWIs per participant, so that we could better account for individual variability in brain structure and age-related changes to both CSF and DWI markers. Second, some caution should be used when interpreting DWI indices and CSF biomarkers. For example, a change in RTOP may be dictated by changes in cellularity, myelination, and axonal volume. 14,15,50,51 Without corroborating histological studies, it can be difficult to attribute specific DWI measurements to specific tissue properties. Similarly, in a mostly preclinical cohort, pTau does not directly reflect the regional accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and is probably, at least in part, indicative of a neuronal response to the deposition of β-amyloid proteins. 13,52 As a result, it is likely that some of our DWI associations with pTau are artificially inflated by underlying amyloid pathology. Third, we did not consider the presence of WM hyperintensities (WMH) in our analysis. Because previous studies have shown that DTI 53 and NODDI 54 metrics are associated with the presence of WMH and because the majority of individuals over the age of 60 exhibit WMH, 53 we cannot rule out the possibility that some of our results may be influenced by uneven macrostructural WM damage between participants. Last, while data harmonization reduces the variability between DWI protocols, it cannot entirely remove protocol-dependent differences in sensitivity to tissue properties. Because of this, we assessed the associations between DWI metrics and CSF markers in the 3shell and 5-shell cohorts independently, finding evidence that some of these relationships appear to be robust to differences in acquisition parameters.",

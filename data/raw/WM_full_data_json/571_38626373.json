    "abstract": "Background and Objectives Previous studies have linked the MRI measures of perivascular spaces (PVSs), diffusivity along the perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS), and free water (FW) to cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and SVD-related cognitive impairments. However, studies on the longitudinal associations between the three MRI measures, SVD progression, and cognitive decline are lacking. This study aimed to explore how PVS, DTI-ALPS, and FW contribute to SVD progression and cognitive decline. Methods This is a cohort study that included participants with SVD who underwent neuroimaging and cognitive assessment, specifically measuring Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), cognitive index, and processing speed, at 2 time points. Three MRI measures were quantified: PVS in basal ganglia (BG-PVS) volumes, FW fraction, and DTI-ALPS. We performed a latent change score model to test inter-relations between the 3 MRI measures and linear regression mixed models to test their longitudinal associations with the changes of other SVD MRI markers and cognitive performances. Results In baseline assessment, we included 289 participants with SVD, characterized by a median age of 67.0 years and 42.9 women. Of which, 220 participants underwent the follow-up assessment, with a median follow-up time of 3.4 years. Baseline DTI-ALPS was associated with changes in BG-PVS volumes (β  -0.09, p  0.030), but not vice versa (β  -0.08, p  0.110). Baseline BG-PVS volumes were associated with changes in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes (β  0.33, p-corrected  0.001) and lacune numbers (β  0.28, p-corrected  0.001); FW fraction was associated with changes in WMH volumes (β  0.30, p-corrected  0.001), lacune numbers (β  0.28, p-corrected  0.001), and brain volumes (β  -0.45, p-corrected  0.001); DTI-ALPS was associated with changes in WMH volumes (β  -0.20, p-corrected  0.002) and brain volumes (β  0.23, p-corrected  0.001). Furthermore, baseline FW fraction was associated with decline in MMSE score (β  -0.17, p-corrected  0.006); baseline FW fraction and DTI-ALPS were associated with changes in cognitive index (FW fraction: β  -0.25, p-corrected  0.001; DTI-ALPS: β  0.20, p-corrected  0.001) and processing speed over time (FW fraction: β  -0.29, p-corrected  0.001; DTI-ALPS: β  0.21, p-corrected  0.001). Discussion Our results showed that increased BG-PVS volumes, increased FW fraction, and decreased DTI-ALPS are related to progression of MRI markers of SVD, along with SVD-related cognitive decline over time. These findings may suggest that the glymphatic dysfunction is related to SVD progression, but further studies are needed.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) encompasses various pathologies affecting the brains small vessels. SVD is the leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. 1,2 A range of MRI features, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes of presumed vascular origin, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), are believed to be pathologic alterations caused by SVD. 1 However, the underlying mechanisms driving SVD development, progression, and concomitant cognitive impairment remain largely unknown.\nThe glymphatic system has been considered as a highly dynamic waste clearance pathway in the CNS 3 and may potentially be related in the pathophysiology of SVD. 4 MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVSs), free water (FW), and diffusion tensor imaging along the PVS (DTI-ALPS) have been used to assess the glymphatic function (Figure 1). 5678 MRI-visible PVSs showed a spatial correlation with small arteries rather than small veins, 9,10 suggesting that these spaces mostly represent periarterial spaces. 11 FW estimates the extracellular water volume fraction, which could be regulated by interstitial fluid (ISF) in the brain parenchyma. 12 DTI-ALPS is based on the assumption that it measures the diffusivity capacity of the perivenous space surrounding the deep medullary vein at the lateral ventricle body level. 13 Although the 3 MRI measures are not formally validated as parameters for glymphatic function, DTI-ALPS has demonstrated a significant correlation with glymphatic clearance rates, as measured through invasive MRI with intrathecal gadolinium injection. 6 Note that this study was not performed in a SVD cohort. While the MRI measures of PVS volumes and FW values were suspected to be the consequence of blockage in glymphatic outflow based on previous studies, this lacks direct validation.\nIn SVD, several studies have demonstrated that higher PVS counts (mostly located in the basal ganglia BG), 14,15 higher FW, and lower DTI-ALPS are related to radiologic severity and cognitive impairment in SVD. 6,8,16 However, most studies used only 1 or 2 of the aforementioned measures with a cross-sectional study design, resulting in inconsistent findings. Currently, there is a lack of longitudinal studies to disentangle the trajectories and inter-relations of these measures, as well as their associations with radiologic and clinical progression of SVD over time.\nIn this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes and inter-relations of PVS, FW, and DTI-ALPS, as well as their longitudinal associations with MRI markers of SVD and cognitive function. We hypothesized that changes in these measures over time are associated with progression of SVD MRI markers and cognitive decline in patients with SVD.",

Detailed information on this study has been described previously. 17 In brief, participants who met the following criteria were included: (1) age between 50 and 85 years, (2) cerebral SVD on MRI (i.e., lacunes or WMH), and (3) clinical symptoms that could be attributed to SVD. Baseline inclusion was in 2006, with 3 follow-up assessments in 2011, 2015, and 2020. However, because of the scanner upgrade between baseline (2006) and the first follow-up (2011) and between the second (2015) and third follow-ups (2020), we only used the data from 2011 and 2015 (eFigure 1). In this study, we set the assessment in 2011 as baseline and assessment in 2015 as follow-up because we only used data from these 2 time points.",

To minimize practice effects, the alternative versions of the tests were used whenever possible. For PPMST, SCWT and VSAT, we used the Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off (SAT) score to quantify the balance between response time and correct responses. The SAT scores were computed as the percentage of correct responses divided by the response time, as described in a previous study. 18 Raw scores of all time points were converted to z-scores by using the difference between the raw score and the mean of the baseline study population, divided by the SD of the baseline study population. Our analysis focused on global cognitive function as a compound measure of cognition and on processing speed because this domain is the most prominent cognitive area and showed the strongest associations with neuroimaging markers in SVD. 19,20 For global cognitive function, we calculated the cognitive index by first averaging the z-scores of the subscores for each cognitive test, followed by averaging the z scores of all tests in the cognitive test battery; for processing speed, we calculated the mean of the z-scores of the PPMST, the reading and color naming tasks of the Stroop Test, and the SDST. In addition, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a measure of global cognitive function.",

PVS segmentations in deep WM presented low quality. As such, PVS volumetry in this study focused only on the BG. Note that previous studies have shown that PVS in deep white matter were mainly associated with cerebral amyloid-β pathologies in Alzheimer disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 29 By contrast, PVS in the BG (BG-PVS) was related to arteriolosclerosis in SVD. 30 BG-PVS volumes were corrected for ICV. To validate the effectivenessrobustness of BG-PVS segmentation, we performed Pearson correlation analysis between the visual rating scores (4-point PVS visual rating scale: 0 score, no PVS; 1 score, 1-10 PVS; 2 score, 11,20 PVS; 3 score, 21,40 PVS; 4 score, 40 PVS) and the volumes for BG-PVS, using a 10 random participant subset from each time point.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we measured BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, and DTI-ALPS and examined their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with MRI markers of SVD and cognitive function in a sporadic SVD cohort. We found that (1) baseline DTI-ALPS was associated with increase of BG-PVS volumes over time, but not the reverse, suggesting a time-lagged association between DTI-ALPS and BG-PVS volumes; (2) increased BG-PVS volumes, increased FW fraction, and decreased DTI-ALPS were related to severity and progression of SVD; and (3) increased FW fraction and decreased DTI-ALPS were associated with impairment and decline of cognitive function. Taken together, our results showed that BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, and DTI-ALPS independently contributed to the progression of SVD burden and cognitive decline in SVD population.\nWe showed that baseline DTI-ALPS was associated with increase in BG-PVS volumes, but not vice versa. This finding builds upon previous studies that merely tested the crosssectional association between DTI-ALPS and PVS, 6,8 by showing that decrease in DTI-ALPS precedes the increase in BG-PVS volumes. This time-lagged association supports the concept of decreased DTI-ALPS being an early contributing mechanism for enlarged BG-PVS, which is proposed to represent the blockage of brain drainage pathways. 11 In addition, we found that FW fraction was not related to either BG-PVS volumes or DTI-ALPS. This could be because the exact mechanisms underlying the increased FW in SVD is highly complex and remains largely unclear yet. Although several studies suggested that increased FW-WM was related to the stagnation of ISF drainage, 5,7 an increase in FW may also be a consequence of other pathologic processes, including the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation, vasogenic edema, and intramyelinic vacuolization in SVD. 16 Therefore, caution is warranted in interpreting an increased FW fraction as a glymphatic dysfunction. Moreover, we did not find any significant changes in BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, and DTI-ALPS over time. This could mainly be because of the relatively short follow-up time (median: 3.4 years) in this study, leading to an insufficient observation window for changes in these measures. In addition, another explanation could be the confounding effects of test-retest variations, especially in the 1.5T MRI scanner, which could either reduce or enlarge the observed changes over time of the 3 measures.\nWe also found that increased BG-PVS volumes, increased FW fraction, and decreased DTI-ALPS were related to the baseline severity and progression of SVD burden (mainly WMH volumes, lacune count, and brain volumes). Similar associations have previously been shown. 6,8,14,15 Our findings corroborate these associations and provide further evidence supporting the hypothesis that early-stage changes in BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, and DTI-ALPS may contribute to the progression of SVD. Nevertheless, we did not find any association between changes in BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, or DTI-ALPS and progression of MRI markers of SVD. This may suggest that the changes in BG-PVS volumes, FW fraction, DTI-ALPS and progression of MRI markers appear at different times. Another explanation could be that the followup time was too short to detect significant changes in these measures that could truly lead to progression of SVD.\nThe association between DTI-ALPS and cognitive performance has been previously explored in cross-sectional studies that have shown that lower DTI-ALPS was related to worse performance in multiple cognitive domains. 37,38 Our findings extended this link by showing that DTI-ALPS at baseline was associated with decline in cognitive index and processing speed over time. It is of interest that the significant association between decreased DTI-ALPS and cognitive impairment remained after adjusting for SVD MRI markers (including white matter integrity), suggesting an independent role of DTI-ALPS in cognitive decline. We also found that increased FW fraction was related to cognitive decline over time, which is consistent with previous studies. 16 Increased FW could cause extensive cerebral structural abnormalities through various pathophysiologic mechanisms, which in turn contribute to cognitive impairment in SVD. 5,16 We did not find any association between BG-PVS volumes and cognitive function based on the cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. This result is consistent with previous studies, which used whole-brain PVS volumetry in SVD and Alzheimer disease. 5,39 Nevertheless, several studies reported significant association between higher BG-PVS numbers and cognitive impairments. 40,41 An independent contribution of PVS on cognitive impairment remains to be established in SVD.\nThe strength of this study is the comprehensive longitudinal imaging assessment in a relatively large sample size of participants with SVD with detailed cognitive data. However, there are some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, although DTI-ALPS has a substantial correlation with glymphatic clearance rates measured by invasive MRI with intrathecal injection of gadolinium, it fundamentally captures the diffusivity along the perivascular spaces, which may originate from different compartments, such as tissue and blood, rather than along the perivascular spaces. 6,13 In addition, this index was measured only at the level of the lateral ventricle body 13 while the glymphatic changes occur throughout the brain. Therefore, DTI-ALPS could only serve as an approximate measure of the regional brain area. Further validations are, therefore, needed for DTI-ALPS in the assessments of glymphatic function. Until then, no conclusion can be made on whether DTI-ALPS can be used as a proxy for glymphatic function. Second, the PVS volumetry was limited in the BG in this study because of the low-quality of PVS segmentations in deep WM. Although SVD-related PVSs are typically concentrated in the BG, 30 the lack of PVS volumetry in other regions (e.g., centrum semiovale and hippocampus) could potentially underestimate the association between PVS volumes and other markers of SVD, as well as cognitive function. Future studies using higher resolution structural MRI, particularly using a high-field strength, could enable an accurate PVS volumetry of the whole brain, thereby providing a better understanding of the role of PVS in SVD and SVD-related cognitive impairments. Third, the statistical models used in our study, specifically the linear mixed model and latent change score model for longitudinal analyses, are not able to draw a casual association. These models, at most, could infer temporal associations, which should not be equal with causal associations. Our observed temporal associations between the three MRI measures, SVD progression, and cognitive decline could be confounded by other concurrent factors, including aging and the accumulation of vascular risk factors. Further work employing more precise methods for assessing glymphatic function, such as MRI with intrathecal injection of gadolinium, and with extended follow-up periods is needed to validate our findings.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that decreases in DTI-ALPS precede increases in BG-PVS volumes, suggesting a time-lagged association between the 2 measures. Increased BG-PVS volumes, increased FW fraction, and decreased DTI-ALPS are independently related to SVD progression, along with SVD-related cognitive decline over time. However, it is essential to formally validate whether these measures accurately represent glymphatic dysfunction in SVD in further studies.",

    "abstract": "To determine the preirradiation baseline association of white matter integrity with neurocognitive function and to assess posttreatment changes in pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma treated with proton therapy. Methods and Materials: Ninety children and adolescents (2-20 years old) with craniopharyngioma were treated with proton therapy (54 Gy RBE) in a prospective therapeutic trial. Neurocognitive performance at the postoperative baseline before proton therapy and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired at baseline and at annual follow-up were analyzed. Tract-based spatial statistics and structural connectomics were used to derive global and local white matter features from DTI. Baseline DTI features were compared for patients with average and below-average neurocognitive performance. Longitudinal DTI data were analyzed to determine the proton dose effect on white matter structures in relation to the irradiated brain volume and baseline age. Results: Before proton therapy, patients with below-average working memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, verbal learning, or fine motor dexterity exhibited more globally degraded white matter structures compared with their counterparts",

      "text": "Craniopharyngioma accounts for approximately 4 of childhood brain and central nervous system tumors. 1 Despite a high overall survival rate (83-96 at 5 years), 2 survivors of craniopharyngioma often experience neurocognitive deficits and other sequelae, such as hypothalamic dysfunction and endocrine deficiencies. 3,4 To mitigate potential surgical morbidity, one of the prevalent treatment strategies favors limited surgery followed by adjuvant proton therapy. Proton therapy has been increasingly considered 5,6 instead of photon therapy because of the dosimetric advantages in sparing cerebral structures relevant to clinical outcomes. 7 Previous studies showed favorable early toxicity profiles and satisfactory disease control in pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma treated with proton therapy. 891011 However, because of the rarity of the disease and the relatively recent advent of proton therapy, our understanding of treatment-related outcomes has been limited, particularly in regard to treatment-related injury to normal brain and its effect on neurocognitive function.\nAnalyzing advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can improve our understanding of neurocognitive outcomes in patients treated with radiation therapy. In particular, substantial attention has been paid to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) because of its sensitivity to radiation-induced alterations in the structural integrity of white matter. 12 Declines in intelligence quotient (IQ), processing speed, and executive function in survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors have been reported to correlate significantly with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial or mean diffusivity in multiple white matter regions, particularly in the corpus callosum. 13141516 Longitudinal studies in adult patients with various brain tumors have found that posttreatment changes in DTI measures in the cingula are associated with a decline in verbal learning at 30 weeks 17 and a decline in executive function at 3 months 18 after treatment. Other longitudinal studies in pediatric patients have found that DTI measures in the frontal lobe 19 and corpus callosum 20 are associated with attention, processing speed, and motor functions.\nOur previous study 21 found that in patients with craniopharyngioma, deep white matter structures underwent an early decline during the first year after proton therapy but subsequently recovered and that surgical defects present in the corpus callosum before irradiation appeared to prevent complete recovery. In the present study, we analyzed neurocognitive data at the preirradiation baseline to determine the association with DTI measures, considering the effects of surgery across the entire brain and other clinical factors. Compared with our earlier study, the longitudinal DTI analysis included more patients and longer follow-up and used advanced methods (ie, tract-based spatial statistics TBSS 22 and structural connectomics 23 ) to examine the entire white matter tracts without being limited to regions of interest determined a priori.",

    "Patients and treatments": {
      "text": "Ninety-four patients with craniopharyngioma were enrolled in an institutional review boardeapproved prospective therapeutic trial (NCT01419067, identifier blinded for review) between August 2011 and March 2016 and treated with passively scattered proton therapy. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants when they were enrolled in the trial. The present study excluded 4 of the enrolled patients because no DTI was available or because there were severe metallic artifacts in their images. Consequently, 90 patients were analyzed (Table 1). This study represents part of the exploratory objectives of the trial.\nThe patients underwent subtotal tumor resection or other surgical procedures for cyst decompression and drainage. They received proton therapy with a total prescribed dose of 54 Gy(RBE) delivered in 1.8-Gy(RBE) fractions over 6 weeks. The median time from tumor surgery (the last surgery before proton therapy if the patient underwent multiple surgeries) to the start of proton therapy was 112 days (range, 16 days to 9.4 years; 3rd quartile, 230 days). The median neuroimaging follow-up was 48 months (range, 30-60 months) excluding 1 patient with only baseline data.",

    "Neurocognitive assessment": {
      "text": "The patients underwent neurocognitive assessments at the postoperative baseline before proton therapy and every year thereafter up to 5 years after therapy. The median time from tumor surgery to the baseline assessments was 107 days (range, 7 days to 9.4 years; the third quartile, 232 days). The present study analyzed only the baseline neurocognitive data because posttreatment evaluations await maturation.\nBased on reports in the literature, 3,24 we selected 5 measures from the protocol battery that are prone to change and most representative (ie, higher-level composite scores as available). The selected measures were Working Memory and Processing Speed Indices from the age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale 25,26 ; Retrieval Fluency from the WoodcockeJohnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (third edition) 27 as a measure of verbal fluency; California Verbal Learning Test Total Trials 28 as a measure of verbal learning and memory; and Grooved Pegboard dominant hand 29 score as a measure of fine-motor dexterity. All neurocognitive scores were age-standardized using large, representative, and normative samples. Table 2 shows the minimum age for each measure. For Working Memory and Processing Speed Indices, we combined Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 25 for children aged 6 to 16 years and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 26 for adults aged 16 years or older. A score more than 1 standard deviation below the normative mean was considered to be below the average range (referred to hereafter as below average).",

    "Image acquisition and processing": {
      "text": "DTI data were acquired at baseline, every 3 months for the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. The present study analyzed baseline and annual DTI data. The median time from tumor surgery to the baseline DTI was 85 days (range, 4 days to 9.4 years; the 3rd quartile, 208 days), and that from the DTI to the start of proton therapy was 27 days (range, 9 days to 53 days). The neuroimaging was often performed on a different day from the neurocognitive assessment (mean of interval, 1.3 days; standard deviation, 15 days), but there was no temporal bias between the 2 measurements (one-sample t test, P Z .45). The intervals between treatments and baseline measurements are illustrated in Figure E1. DTI scans were performed on a 1.5-T Avanto, a 3-T Skyra, or a 3-T Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany), for which 12 directions of diffusion-encoding gradients were used, with a b-value of 1000 smm 2 and 4 averages. The other imaging parameters were as follows: repetition time, 6700-12,000 ms; echo time, 100 to 120 ms; in-plane resolution, 1.5-1.8 mm Â 1.5-1.8 mm; and slice thickness, 3 to 4 mm.\nThe DTI data were processed using the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library 30 to derive the FA and perform TBSS analysis according to the standard procedure. 31 Once an individual FA map was spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) coordinates, the voxel-wise FA in the major white matter tracts (the skeleton) was derived for statistical comparison. The International Consortium for Brain Mapping atlas 32 was used to facilitate the identification of the white matter structure to which each voxel belonged. In addition to the voxel-wise local values, we calculated the mean FA over the entire skeleton as a global measure.\nFor the structural connectome, the individual brain was parcellated into 90 cortical and subcortical gray matter regions of interest (ROIs), for which the ROIs defined by Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas in the MNI space 33 were deformed onto the individual brain by using Elastix software. 34 The automatic parcellation was reviewed, and a manual editing of the ROIs was performed as necessary. When the deformation algorithm failed because of a severe brain distortion, a 2-step deformation was performed: The template brain was first deformed to the brain of another patient with relatively less distortion, and that brain was then deformed to the patient of interest. Tractography was subsequently performed using the Diffusion Toolkit 35 to determine the structural connectivity between each ROI pair, as detailed in the literature. 31 The connectivity of all ROIs was processed with the Brain Connectivity Toolbox 23 to derive global graph measures such as the global efficiency and the modularity. The Network-Based Statistics (NBS) tool was used to identify subnetworks that might differ between patients with average and below-average neurocognitive performance. 36 Gray matter regions are more directly connected in a brain network with higher global efficiency. The modularity represents the level of partitioning of the brain network into nonoverlapping regions. Modularity increases during infancy but thereafter undergoes only minimal changes or decreases slightly because no major reorganization of structural modules occurs after the age of 2 years. 37 Poor brain connectivity typically results in lower global efficiency and higher modularity.\nBesides DTI, preoperative and postoperative anatomic MRI (T1, T2, and FLAIR) of each patient was reviewed to delineate intracerebral postoperative changes, including the surgical corridors and catheter tracts. The union of those regions was deformed onto the aforementioned MNI space to derive a frequency map of occupation by surgical defects. The proton dose distribution on the planning CT was similarly deformed onto the MNI space to derive the average proton dose distribution for the entire patient cohort.",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "For each neurocognitive measure, the participants were divided into those with scores falling below average and those with average scores. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the 2 groups in terms of the global DTI measures at baseline, with baseline age and sex as covariates. The use of a categorical approach, as opposed to analyzing the neurocognitive measure on a continuous scale, was based on clinical relevance and is a common practice in the literature. 38,39 We performed additional ANCOVA for whether or not craniotomy for tumor resection was performed, the number of surgeries, the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion as a surrogate measure of obstructive hydrocephalus, and preoperative hypothalamic involvement to investigate the effects of surgery and the clinical factors on the neurocognitive and DTI measures.\nTBSS and NBS were used to compare local DTI measures for the 2 patient groups for each neurocognitive function. For the fine motor function of the dominant hand, only the right-handed patients (Table 1) were included in these local analyses. These comparisons were based on a nonparametric t test using 5000 permutations, which controlled for family-wise error. The voxel-wise FAs of white matter skeletons were examined by TBSS. NBS searched for significant local clustered connections. 36 Longitudinal trends in the DTI measures were tested with a generalized estimating equation (GEE), 40 with the covariates of baseline age, sex, and time. To examine the effect of radiation dose on the longitudinal trends, the GEE added an interaction term between time and brain volume receiving at least 90, 50, and 10 of the prescription dose (V90 brain , V50 brain , and V10 brain ). The effect of age on each trend was also tested with another interaction term between time and baseline age.

      "text": "Before proton therapy, 19 to 33 of the patients who underwent neurocognitive assessments exhibited belowaverage neurocognitive performance in the 5 measures (Table 2; see the Table E1 for the patient numbers in each subdivided group). ANCOVA showed that those patients exhibited lower mean FA, decreased global efficiency, and higher modularity over the whole brain compared with the patients with average performance (Fig. 1), all of which indicated lower white matter integrity and the resultant lower brain connectivity. Verbal fluency was significantly associated with all of the global DTI measures, and mean FA was associated with all neurocognitive functions analyzed in this study. In addition to the group comparison, an alternative analysis of the data on a continuous scale is provided in the Table E2.",

    "Associations between baseline neurocognitive performance and local DTI measures": {
      "text": "TBSS analysis revealed that the white matter tracts with lower FA were distributed across almost the entire brain in patients with below-average performance, particularly in working memory and processing speed (Fig. 2a). For the other cognitive skills, the associations with some of the left white matter tracts were more significant in the left hemisphere than were the associations with their counterparts in the right hemisphere. Such lateralized association was apparent in the cerebral peduncle, internal and external capsules, and corona radiata for the verbal functions (ie, verbal fluency and verbal learning) and in the brain stem (the cerebral peduncle, corticospinal tract, and medial lemniscus) and superiorinferior cerebellar peduncle for fine motor dexterity (Fig. 2b). A significant association with the body of the corpus callosum was commonly observed for all neurocognitive functions. NBS analysis found no local clustered connections that differed significantly between the 2 patient groups, reflecting the nonlocal character of the reduced FA. Associations of surgery, CSF diversion, and hypothalamic involvement with DTI measure and neurocognitive function\nFigure 2c shows that surgical defects were more prevalent in the right hemisphere, which is consistent with rightlateralized surgical approaches used for most (60) of the patients (Table 1). The frequent surgical defects in the right inferior frontal and temporal gyri were the result of craniotomies performed with frontotemporal or cranio-orbital approaches. The white matter tracts in the region with the most frequent defect (found in 20 of patients; the dark red region in Fig. 1c) tended to show lower FA compared with the contralateral tracts in the patients who underwent right-sided surgery (P Z .02 by paired t test; n Z 54), although the difference was subtle (0.01 of FA on average). Other regions exhibiting frequent defects included the cingulate gyri and the body of the corpus callosum; defects in these regions were mostly attributed to transcallosal craniotomy or catheter placement. Additional ANCOVA revealed strong associations between DTI measures and the extent of surgerydthat is, whether craniotomy for tumor resection was performed and the number of surgeries (Table 3). All global DTI measures were strongly associated with hypothalamic involvement, and global efficiency was significantly lower in the patients with CSF diversion than in other patients. For neurocognitive functions, we found associations of verbal learning with whether craniotomy was performed, of processing speed and fine motor function with the number of surgeries, and of retrieval fluency and verbal learning with hypothalamic involvement.",

Figure 2d depicts the average proton dose distribution and the location of the irradiated volumes. The GEE analysis found that mean FA and global efficiency increased after proton therapy whereas modularity decreased (Fig. 3a), all of which indicates improved white matter tracts. The patients in whom a larger brain volume was irradiated exhibited smaller improving trends (Fig. 3b)dthat is, the interaction term between time and V90 brain , V50 brain , or V10 brain was mostly significant for the global DTI measures. Regarding the age effect, the mean FA and global efficiency of younger patients were smaller than those of older patients at baseline, but they increased more rapidly after proton therapy than did those of older patients (Fig. 3c). There was no difference between younger and older patients regarding modularity at baseline and no difference in their longitudinal trends.",

    "Effects of surgery on postoperative white matter integrity and neurocognitive performance": {
      "text": "The alterations in white matter structures in the patients with below-average performance at the postoperative baseline were partially related to surgical interventions (Fig. 2, Table 3; see Fig. E2 for an illustration of relations among the investigated variables). Individual FA maps often clearly showed disrupted white matter tracts near surgical corridors and catheter tracts, particularly in the corpus callosum. The associations of the body of the corpus callosum with all neurocognitive functions reflected such surgical effects. The reduced FA in the right brain regions that were the sites of the most frequent surgical defects is consistent with the report that  18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose uptake was decreased in the hemisphere corresponding to the side of surgical intervention. 43 However, the alterations in white matter tracts were not limited to the regions with surgical defects, suggesting that factors other than surgery might have contributed to the alterations. The associations of the DTI measures with CSF diversion and preoperative hypothalamic involvement (Table 3) suggest that obstructive hydrocephalus and preoperative tumor effects were also related to the white matter changes. The patients who underwent transsphenoidal resection did not exhibit the surgical defects that were attributed to craniotomy. Accordingly, they mostly exhibited average neurocognitive performance, and their DTI measures were not significantly different from those who did not undergo resection (P  .2).\nIt is notable that some left white matter tracts were unilaterally associated with verbal and motor functions (Figs. 2a,2b). The lateralized association with motor function was manifested in the corticospinal tract in the brain stem and in the cerebellar tracts that are responsible for motor control and coordination. An additional TBSS analysis excluding patients operated with a right-sided approach confirmed that the left-lateralized association was also present in this subgroup. These findings are consistent with the understanding that most language ability and dominant-hand fine motor control are left-lateralized, 44 and they support the use of surgical approaches to midline tumors via the nondominant (ie, right) hemisphere.\nThe associations of the DTI measures with surgery, hypothalamic involvement, and hydrocephalus and neurocognitive performance imply an indirect effect of white matter structural integrity on the relation between the surgical and clinical variables and neurocognitive performance. A mediation analysis with DTI 45 might benefit understanding the extent of variance in the neurocognitive performance accounted for by the investigated variables.",

    "Effect of proton therapy on longitudinal changes in DTI measures": {
      "text": "The improving trends in global DTI measures (Fig. 3a) confirmed our previous finding 21 that the integrity of most deep white matter structures recovered after proton therapy. The rate of change was lower as a result of the higher radiation dose, but the improving trend in the GEE model was mostly maintained, rather than being converted to a declining trend (Fig. 3b). Visual inspection of individual longitudinal FAs confirmed the improving trend in most white matter structures, whereas the patients who underwent transcallosal craniotomy often exhibited persistently reduced FA in the body of the corpus callosum and cingula, which is consistent with the findings of our previous study. 21 The trends of more rapidly increasing mean FA and global efficiency in younger patients (Fig. 3c) most likely reflect the normal age-related growth rate of the white matter in younger patients being faster than that in older patients. 46 This result again suggests that the white matter structures analyzed in this study were mostly preserved up to 5 years after proton therapy, particularly in the younger patients. As previously mentioned, the normal age-related trend in modularity is relatively stable by comparison with the trends in FA and global efficiency. Indeed, our data showed that longitudinal modularity was not significantly associated with age, indicating that the change observed was attributable not to normal aging but to the recovery of white matter structures that were altered at baseline.",

    "Implications for neurocognitive outcomes": {
      "text": "The improving trends in DTI measures, together with their associations with baseline neurocognitive performance, have implications for the preservation of neurocognitive functions after proton therapy. It is particularly encouraging that the improving trends were mostly maintained even with larger irradiated brain volumes and younger patients, variables that have been previously correlated with late effects. 47 Consistent with these implications, recent studies in pediatric patients with brain tumors found no significant declines in multiple neurocognitive domains including IQ, attention, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed 4849505152535455 at median or mean follow-up of 2.5 to 4.5 years after proton therapy. Notably, comparative studies among them suggested that proton therapy is associated with superior performances with respect to IQ, perceptual reasoning, and working memory compared with photon therapy. 50,54,55 However, the subgroup analyses identified several factors associated with weak performances, including younger age, 52 receipt of craniospinal irradiation (as opposed to focal treatment), 51,53 and receipt of a higher dose to critical structures such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus. 48 Our continuing study will include posttreatment neurocognitive scores. Considering the DTI data, we anticipate that the neurocognitive outcomes for our patients will be mostly stable, if not showing improvement. There may be a proton dose effect on the outcomes, particularly for patients who have undergone extensive surgery or irradiation of a larger brain volume.",

    "Study limitations": {
      "text": "As Table 2 indicates, not all of the 90 patients participated in neurocognitive assessments. The primary reason for this was the test-specific minimum age requirement. Other reasons included patients not speaking English or having visual impairment. Consequently, the reported baseline associations with neurocognitive data had limitations in reflecting children younger than 6 years. As most such young children underwent general anesthesia during imaging sessions and radiation treatment, the cumulative anesthesia exposure could affect the neurocognitive performance. 56 However, this potential effect on the baseline performance reported in this study is likely minimal. When interpreting the baseline associations with surgical parameters, it is necessary to consider the wide distribution of the time from surgery to the baseline, because the subacute and long-term effects of surgery can vary.\nIt should be noted that the reported longitudinal image change has not been verified with respect to the corresponding clinical outcome. The present longitudinal analysis was limited to global DTI features because we found no significant association with local connectivity at baseline when a data-driven approach was used to examine all local connections. It might be worthwhile to investigate hypothesis-driven local features, such as function-specific neural circuits, 57 in relation to neurocognitive data. Given that this study focused on white matter only, further longitudinal studies including other imaging modalities that measure gray matter features, such as perfusion MRI and positron emission tomography, will extend our understanding of late effects.\nA methodologic limitation of this study was the use of 2 types of MRI scanner with different magnetic field strengths (ie, 1.5 and 3 T) for logistical reasons. However, most (82) of the analyzed DTI data sets, including all of the baseline data sets, were acquired on the 1.5-T scanner. We do not expect that the occasional use of a 3-T scanner had a significant effect, as supported by several previous studies. 585960 We repeated the analysis using only 1.5-T data and observed similar longitudinal trends as in Fig. 3 (see Fig. E3). The deformation-based automatic parcellation for a severely distorted brain could be another methodologic concern, despite the deliberate deformation method and manual correction. However, the global DTI measures were not sensitive to minor deviations in the ROIs. The statistical significance finding in this study did not differ when the parcellation before manual correction was used instead.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "Below-average neurocognitive performance in patients with craniopharyngioma before they underwent proton therapy was associated with global degradation of white matter structural integrity, which was partly attributed to surgery, obstructive hydrocephalus, or preoperative hypothalamic involvement. The associations of verbal and dominant-hand fine motor functions with the relevant white matter tracts on the left side of the brain support the use of right-sided surgical approaches. The overall improving trends for DTI integrity and efficiency measure up to 5 years after proton therapy, particularly in children in whom a smaller brain volume was irradiated, which is consistent with the emerging literature suggesting stable cognitive outcomes after proton therapy.",

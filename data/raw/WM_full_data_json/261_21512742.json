    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterise the white matter damage involved in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the relationship between this damage and clinical presentation. Twenty patients with INPH, 20 patients with Alzheimers disease and 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease (as disease control groups) were enrolled in this study. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were determined using DTI, and these measures were analysed to compare the INPH group with the control groups and with certain clinical correlates. On average, the supratentorial white matter presented higher MD and lower FA in the INPH group than in the control groups. In the INPH group, the mean hemispheric FA correlated with some of the clinical measures, whereas the mean hemispheric MD did not. On a voxel-based statistical map, white matter involvement with high MD was localised to the periventricular regions, and white matter involvement with low FA was localised to the corpus callosum and the subcortical regions. The total scores on the Frontal Assessment Battery were correlated with the FA in the frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, and an index of gait disturbance was correlated with the FA in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule and under the left supplementary motor area. DTI revealed the presence of white matter involvement in INPH. Whereas white matter regions with high MD were not related to symptom manifestation, those with low FA were related to motor and cognitive dysfunction in INPH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "It is believed that a disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics is involved in the development of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) 1,2. Ventricular dilation, which is an essential neuroradiological and neuropathological indicator of idiopathic NPH (INPH), has been postulated to be caused by reduced CSF absorption by the arachnoid villi or capillaries 3,4. Adams has stated that mechanical compression of the neural tracts caused by an expansion in the lateral ventricles produces the typical gait disturbance observed in NPH patients 1. Regardless of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NPH, neuropathological findings are generally consistent in demonstrating the involvement of white matter. Indeed, a variety of pathological characteristics, such as direct mechanical compression of the periventricular white matter, ischaemic demyelination, and infarction, have been observed in the brains of patients with NPH 567. In one neuropathological study, disruption of the ependymal lining, interstitial oedema, axonal degeneration, and gliosis were noted in the periventricular white matter regions of patients who presented with chronic hydrocephalus (including patients with INPH) and were thought to be associated with the development of motor and cognitive dysfunction 8. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on white matter as the main locus affected by INPH and measured the changes of white matter in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a useful MRI technique that reflects the movement of water molecules within tissues 9,10. An increase in the mean diffusivity (MD) of a tissue is associated with increased free water diffusion in the extracellular space of that tissue. The fractional anisotropy (FA) reflects the degree of directionality of intracellular water diffusion and the structural integrity of the white matter 111213. Therefore, these DTI indices are both useful tools for evaluating white matter involvement in patients with INPH. Although the involvement of white matter in INPH has previously been studied using DTI 14, the severe morphological changes that occur in the brains of patients with INPH have precluded the use of voxel-based analysis 15. Nevertheless, a recent study demonstrated microstructural changes in periventricular white matter structures that could be functionally relevant to gait disturbance and indicated a novel possibility for the detection of an association between white matter lesions and clinical symptoms in INPH patients 16. However, it is doubtful that damage to the pyramidal tract could cause the gait disturbance involved in INPH, which is characterised as broad-based, magnetic, and petit pas gait 17. In addition, the association between cognitive dysfunction and white matter lesions in INPH patients remains uncertain. In the present study, acquired DTI data were used in a voxel-based analysis that adopted a customised white matter template that reflects morphological aspects of INPH for spatial normalisation, using the technique for both manual and automatic image processing. We included patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and idiopathic Parkinsons disease (IPD) as disease control groups because the cognitive and gait disturbances that occur in these patients are generally due to gray matter involvement 18,19. By comparing INPH patients with patients with AD or with IPD, we attempted to elucidate white matter changes that occur in patients with INPH. We also sought to uncover associations between the occurrence of white matter changes andor ventricular dilation with a patients clinical presentation.",

The criteria for the diagnosis of definite INPH are as follows:\n(1)60 years of age; (2) gait disturbance, dementia, andor urinary incontinence; (3) ventricular dilation (Evans Index 0.3) with a narrow CSF space in the superior convexity; (4) CSF pressure 200 mmH 2 O with a normal CSF cell count and normal CSF protein levels; (5) absence of another disease that could account for their symptoms; (6) no previous illness that could have caused ventricular dilation; and (7) improved INPH symptoms after shunt placement.\nIn the present study, shunt responsiveness was defined as an improvement by one point or more on the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus grading scale (iNPHGS), which is a validated scale for the measurement of INPH symptom severity, within 1 year of shunt placement 21. To evaluate patients motor and cognitive symptoms, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) 22, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 23, and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) 24 were administered. We used the FAB, which is a simple and useful tool for assessing the frontal lobe functions of patients, because it has been reported that frontal lobe dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the cognitive impairment that occurs in patients with INPH 25. In this study, we assessed patients symptoms, administered the TUG, MMSE, and FAB, and performed MRI scans prior to performing both a lumbar puncture for CSF removal and the shunt operation to elucidate the clinical and radiological features of pre-operative INPH patients whose symptoms improved after shunt placement.",

These measurements were performed by two neurologists who were blinded to the subjects clinical data. The infratentorial structures were excluded according to the method of Pfaendner et al. 26. The VVSTV ratio, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the volume of the lateral ventricles and the volume of the third ventricle by the volume of the supratentorial intracranial region, was calculated as an All diffusion images were aligned with the initial b0 image, and we used motion correction and registration software from the FSL software package (http:www.fmrib. ox.ac.ukfsl) to perform motion correction and eddy current distortion correction 27. The corrected images for each direction, which were acquired in two scans, were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the MD and FA maps were calculated from the mean diffusion-weighted images for each direction using DTI calculation software from the FSL software package. The initial b0 image and the 3D-SPGR image of each subject were co-registered, and the obtained co-registered parameters were applied to the corresponding MD and FA maps using the SPM5 software package.\nTo anatomically normalise the MD and FA maps, supratentorial brain segmentation was first performed using the SPM5 software package (http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. ukspm) with individualised masks (created using MRIcron 28 for each subject) fitted to the lateral and third ventricles. Next, we created a mean white matter image from all subjects segmented images using the SPM5 realign algorithm. This image was then smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian filter (8 mm, FWHM), and the resultant image served as a white matter template. We used this customised white matter template instead of the standard template because the standard template could not be used to effectively analyse the marked deformations present in the brains of INPH patients. The white matter image of each subject was normalised to the custom white matter template, and the normalised parameters obtained were applied to the co-registered MD and FA maps. The normalised MD and FA maps were subsequently smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian filter (10 mm, FWHM).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, we found that white matter in the cerebral hemispheres was implicated in INPH. We also found that the white matter involvement in specific regions was correlated with both motor and cognitive symptoms experienced by INPH patients. Before discussing the implications of our findings, it is important to discuss the methodological limitations of our study. Rather than comparing INPH patients with normal, healthy controls, we compared them with disease controls, i.e., patients with either AD or IPD. This might have led to an underestimation of the changes that occur in INPH patients. In AD patients, increased MD values and reduced FA values in the temporoparietal subcortical white matter have been reported 31,32. Karagulle et al. 33 observed a significant decrease in the FA values in the medial frontal lobes of IPD patients. However, there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that specific white matter regions exhibit decreased MD values or increased FA values in patients with AD or IPD. Therefore, this suggests that our findings are rather robust.\nIncreased MD values in periventricular white matter were also found in a previous study in which region-ofinterest analysis of periventricular white matter was performed in pre-operative INPH patients 34. Despite these findings, no significant association was observed between hemispheric MD values and any of the clinical measures that we used. High MD values theoretically reflect an increase in the extracellular water content in the particular region being studied, and the distribution of the areas with increased MD values in INPH patients could suggests the presence of interstitial oedema in periventricular white matter regions. This phenomenon has previously been demonstrated in a neuropathological study of patients with chronic hydrocephalus 8. The degree of interstitial oedema could be associated with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to white matter involvement in patients with INPH, but it is not directly correlated with the severity of the clinical symptoms of patients with INPH.\nIn contrast, the MD values observed in the superior convexity of the medial frontal subcortical white matter were lower in the INPH group than in either control group. A low MD value indicates a reduced amount of extracellular space and increased axonal fibre density in the region 35 reported that shuntresponsive INPH presented with neuroradiological features, including an enlarged basal cistern and sylvian fissures and a decreased CSF space in the superior convexity and medial subarachnoid space. Indeed, in a recent clinical study, observation of these features predicted good shunt responsiveness in elderly INPH patients 36. Ishii et al. 37 demonstrated that the grey matter densities of the para-interhemispheric and frontoparietal cortices at the dorsal convexity were elevated in INPH patients, and they suggested that this could be due to mechanical compression of the brain parenchyma in these regions by enlarged ventricles and sylvian fissures. The white matter in these regions is also likely to be compressed, which could lead to a constriction of extracellular spaces.\nThe distribution of white matter regions with low FA values in the INPH group was different from that of regions with high MD values, as the areas with low FA values were distributed across the periventricular white matter, predominantly in the posterior cerebrum. The hemispheric FA value was significantly associated with the FAB total score and with the TUG number of steps in INPH patients. Because FA theoretically reflects the structural integrity of the white matter, low FA values imply disintegration of the white matter. This white matter disintegration could lead to motor and cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, the function of the corona radiata, which contains the pyramidal tract and sensory radiation and in which the FA value was preserved despite high MD values, appeared to be maintained in INPH patients, as pyramidal signs and sensory disturbances do not typically develop in INPH patients. Hattingen et al. 16 reported that the FA values observed in the periventricular corticospinal tract in INPH patients were higher than those in healthy controls and were correlated with the severity of gait disturbances. In the present study, we did not detect such effects, despite our use of disease controls. Further studies are needed to understand whether the lesions with high FA values are associated with the clinical symptoms of INPH patients.\nIn our voxel-based linear regression analyses, gait disturbance, as assessed by the TUG number of steps, was negatively correlated with the subcortical white matter FA value in the left SMA and left anterior limb of the internal capsule. The SMA is thought to play a role in the planning or programming of voluntary movements, including gait. In a single photon emission computed tomography study, the SMA was found to be activated during voluntary walking in normal subjects 38. Gait apraxia caused by SMA lesions has also been reported 39,40. A recent functional MRI study demonstrated that increased activation of the SMA after CSF drainage in INPH patients was significantly correlated with an improvement in sequential motor learning 41. The anterior limb of the internal capsule, where the thalamofrontal and frontopontine projection fibres run, is also hypothesised to be involved in motor function. Therefore, the results of the present study support the theory that a disconnection between the SMA and subcortical structures causes gait disturbances in INPH patients. In addition, our results demonstrated a left hemispheric dominance related to gait disturbance. In previous functional MRI studies, left SMA-dominance has been reported during unilateral finger movement and bimanual coordination in right-handers 42,43, although it has not been observed during locomotion. Further studies will be required to investigate the existence of hemispheric dominance in the SMA for locomotion.\nThe voxel-based linear regression analyses revealed that the FAB score was negatively correlated with the FA values for the frontal subcortical white matter (including the SLF and SOFF), the genu of the corpus callosum, and the superior parietal subcortical white matter. The SLF and SOFF are association fibres that connect the frontal lobe to the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The genu of the corpus callosum is a commissural fibre that projects to the bilateral prefrontal areas, which are thought to be the main centres of executive function 44. Several functional imaging studies have revealed that the superior parietal lobule is associated with basic attentional processes and that it mediates the fundamental processes of executive function 45. Thus, the disruption of a number of different interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connections might cause the executive dysfunction that occurs in INPH patients.\nThe nature of the white matter disintegration that occurs in INPH patients is still unknown. Nevertheless, the finding that some of the clinical symptoms associated with INPH recover after shunt placement implies that the abnormalities observed in the areas of white matter with low FA values should be at least partially reversible. A recent study demonstrated that periventricular white matter lesions observed through MRI andor CT scans could be reversed by shunt operation in some shunt-responsive INPH patients 46. In combination with the results of the present study, the neuropathological finding of reversible white matter lesions in INPH patients might be related to interstitial oedema, which is detected by high MD values. Further studies are needed to clarify which regions with low FA values are able to recover after a shunt operation. Our findings concerning the distribution of areas with low FA values suggest that mechanical distortion, extension, and compression of white matter arise from marked deformation of the brain in INPH patients. However, we did not observe any significant correlations between ventricular size and either of the white matter involvement indices or clinical symptoms (as assessed by the MMSE, FAB, and TUG) in INPH patients in this study. Individual differences in the compliance of the brain or other unknown factors might explain this discrepancy.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to explore the changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) by analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). DTI data were collected from 17 AD patients, 27 MCI subjects and 19 healthy controls. Voxel-based analysis with TBSS was used to compare FA among the three groups. Additionally, guided by TBSS findings, a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis along the TBSS skeleton was performed on group-level and the accuracy of the method was assessed by the back-projection of ROIs to the native space FA. Neurofiber tracts with decreased FA included: the parahippocampal white matter, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, fornix, tracts in brain stem, and cerebellar tracts. Quantitative ROI-analysis further demonstrated the significant decrease on FA values in AD patients relative to controls whereas FA values of MCI patients were found in between the controls and AD patients. We conclude that TBSS is a promising method in examining the degeneration of neurofiber tracts in MCI and AD patients.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is thought to be a transition stage between normal aging and AD. Evidence has shown gradual loss of morphological and functional integrity of cortico-cortical pathways in AD patients, for review see (Delbeuck et al., 2003). The earliest processes take place prior to clinical symptoms. Accurate and early detection of the pathological changes will be of particular importance when disease process-modifying drugs become available for AD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique that has been used in several diseases in evaluating the integrity of white matter tracts in vivo (Kyriakopoulos et al., 2007;Newcombe et al., 2007). In central nervous system, the water molecules are subjected to less hindrance parallel to the white matter tracts than perpendicular to them. This property, diffusion anisotropy, is exploited in DTI experiment as the directionality and the extent of diffusion may be extracted from the tensor model.\nPathological changes in the architecture of the axons in parallel bundles and their myelin sheaths, such as swelling, shrinkage or loss of tissue organization, cause alteration in diffusion anisotropy, for review see (Mori and Zhang, 2006). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is the most commonly used quantitative parameter to describe diffusion anisotropy. FA is independent of the fiber orientation, and could be used to objectively and straightforwardly compare across subjects and groups (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996).\nDTI studies using either region of interest (ROI)-based (Bozzali et al., 2002;Choi et al., 2005;Naggara et al., 2006;Stahl et al., 2007;Sugihara et al., 2004;Takahashi et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2007) or voxel-based methods (Medina et al., 2006;Teipel et al., 2007;Xie et al., 2006) have shown promising but somewhat discrepant findings in AD and MCI patients. With the previously used ROI-based methods, it is difficult to objectively and reproducibly place ROIs on small or thin tracts on the images of individual patients, when the slice orientation and anatomical details (such as atrophy) may show variation between individuals and the boundaries of the white matter tracts are not easily identified. Obviously, there is also variability arising between different studies that may have variable criteria for ROI selection. Furthermore, the ROI approach can reveal changes only in pre-selected areas thus lacking whole brain volume information.\nTo overcome the weaknesses of the ROI-based methods, voxel-based DTI methods have been used to study the changes in anisotropy in a fully automated manner without specifying ROIs in advance or limiting study to specific tracts (Ashburner and Friston, 2000). However, alignmentrelated problems in the previous voxel-based approaches may yield serious problems (Smith et al., 2006). A recent report demonstrated that by using the same DTI data, the current voxel-based methods can lead to dramatically different results (Jones et al., 2007), highlighting the urgent need for a sophisticated and reproducible voxel-based approach.\nA new voxel-based method, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), has been recently proposed. It alleviates the alignment-related problems by applying both linear and nonlinear alignment to data and additionally projecting the FA values of individual subjects in given spatial locations to the thinned common FA-skeleton of major white matter structures, thus improving sensitivity, objectivity, and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject DTI data (Smith et al., 2006(Smith et al., , 2007)). The purpose of the present study was to analyze DTI data from AD patients, MCI subjects, and age-matched healthy controls with TBSS to explore the changes in FA in MCI and AD.",

    "Subjects": {
      "text": "The original study population consisted of 76 subjects: 31 MCI subjects, 22 AD patients, and 23 controls. Alto-gether 13 subjects were excluded from the study: 4 MCI subjects (due to sequence artefacts), 5 AD patients (due to sequence or motion artefacts), and 4 controls (3 had old ischaemic lesions and 1 had sequence artefacts). However, presences of periventricular or deep white matter hyperintensities were not exclusive criteria. Consequently, a total of 63 subjects were included in this study: 27 MCI subjects (12 female, 15 male; mean age  SD: 75  6 years), 17 AD patients (11 female, 6 male; 76  7 years), and 19 controls (8 female, 11 male; 75  6 years). Experienced attending doctors and neuropsychologists made the diagnosis of MCI and AD. The AD patients met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke and Alzheimers disease (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for a diagnosis of probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). MCI subjects fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MCI (Petersen et al., 2001(Petersen et al., , 1999)), i.e.\n(1) memory complaint by patient, family, or physician; (2) normal activities of daily living; (3) normal global cognitive function; (4) objective impairment in memory as evidenced by a score 1.5 SD below the average of a normative agematched sample group in at least one of the memory tests included in the neuropsychological test battery; (5) Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score of 0.5; and (6) absence of dementia according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD (McKhann et al., 1984). All MCI subjects had amnestic MCI. The controls were identified as cognitively normal, and they did not have any neurological or psychiatric disorders or psychoactive medication. The CDR score was 0 for controls, 0.5 for MCI subjects, and for AD patients 0.5 (n  1), 1 (n  12), or 2 (n  4), and differed significantly across the groups (p  0.001). The mean Mini-Mental State (MMSE) scores were for controls 28  1, MCI subjects 26  2 and AD patients 22  5, and differed significantly across the groups (p  0.001). There were no significant differences in gender (Chi square, p  0.323), age (p  0.953), and education years (p  0.447) among AD and MCI patients, and control subjects (Table 1). All subjects were participants of the 1-year follow-up study AddNeuroMed (Lovestone et al., 2007). Participants were recruited in the Department of Neurology, University of Kuopio and were investigated according to a protocol that included: inclusionexclusion criteria, informed consent, subject and informant details, subject demographics, case history, family history, current medication. The controls and MCI subjects were clinically assessed at baseline, and will be assessed at 1 year, and AD patients at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The DTI data presented here were acquired at baseline. Local ethical committee approved the study and informed consents were acquired from all the subjects.",

      "text": "MR studies were performed on a clinical 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Avanto, Erlangen, Germany) using an eightelement receiving coil. The imaging protocol included a T1-weighted 3D sequence and axial PDT2-weighted DTI data analysis was performed following the standard procedure of voxelwise cross-subject analysis using TBSS (Smith et al., 2006(Smith et al., , 2007)), which, together with other image processing tools used here, is provided in FSL software package (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). After the eddycurrent correction (linear alignment to the reference scan using FLIRT) the diffusion tensor was calculated with the DTIFIT program for whole brain volumes and resulting FA volumes were used in TBSS analysis. Direct registration of individual FA volumes to the FMRIB58 template was applied and as described in the original papers (Smith et al., 2006(Smith et al., , 2007)), the mean FA-image was created following registration (Fig. 1A) and thinned to represent the mean FA skeleton (Fig. 1B, FA  0.2 overlaid with the mean FA image). Individual FA volumes were then projected onto this common skeleton. Following these steps, data were fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistical analyses with following group comparisons; control vs. AD, control vs. MCI and MCI vs. AD. In all cases, the null distribution was built up over 5000 permutations, and significance was tested at p  0.05 and 0.01 levels, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Differences between groups were illustrated by masking significant voxels with yellow (p  0.05) and red color (p  0.01) (Fig. 1B andC) and if not otherwise specified the results are discussed as p  0.01. For the control over multiple comparison correction within the data we tested cluster-level inference at t  2.7, p  0.05, false discovery rate theory (Genovese et al., 2002) (at level q  0.05) and threshold-free cluster-enhancement (Smith and Nichols, 2007). None of the multiple comparison correction methods were successful in revealing the significant clusters (except in the genu of corpus callosum with cluster-level inference between the AD and control groups).\nThe region of interest-analysis was based on the original TBSS mean FA skeleton overlaid with FA differences (uncorrected voxelwise) between control subjects and AD patients. Such approach provided us the ability to determine the size and the location of continuous ROIs in distinct white matter tracts most severely affected by the disease. The ROIs were drawn on the side with more pronounced FA changes first and these ROIs were then mirrored on the contralateral side in corresponding symmetric tracts (Fig. 1D). For the tracts mainly localized in the midline (body of fornix and body of corpus callosum) only one set of ROIs were drawn. The FA values of AD patients, MCI subjects, and healthy controls were extracted using identical set of ROIs along the individual FA skeletons that were aligned onto common space during the TBSS processing, and subsequently compared between the groups with one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Due to the thickness of 5 mm in the present study, the abnormalities were considered true only if the abnormal voxels were continuous and more than 5 mm in length. In addition, we back-projected two sets of ROIs to the native space of control and AD groups to check whether the reslicing and atlas transformation significantly bias the results. One ROI set was on small structure left parahippocampal tract and the other one was on large structure body of corpus callosum. Bland-Altman plots (Bland and Altman, 1986) were used to test the agreements between FA values extracted from re-sliced TBSS skeleton FA map and native space.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Many studies using DTI in MCI and AD have been reported recently. However, the findings are to some extent discrepant (Table 4). In subjects with MCI, it has been reported from no FA change (Damoiseaux et al., 2009) or significant FA reduction only in posterior cingulum (Zhang et al., 2007) to significant FA reduction in parahippocampal white matter, superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fibers of the superior frontal, superior temporal, and right frontal gyrus, posterior cingulum, superior and posterior thalamic peduncles, sub-lobar extra-nuclear WM, and bilateral sub- gyral cingulate gyrus arcuate fibers of the superior (Medina et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006). On the other hand, studies have shown significant FA reduction in multiple fiber tracts in AD patients involving uncinate, superior, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (corresponding to temporal, parietal frontal and occipital WM), fornix, cingulum, corpus callosum, thalamic peduncle (Bozzali et al., 2002;Medina et al., 2006;Naggara et al., 2006;Stricker et al., 2009;Takahashi et al., 2002;Taoka et al., 2006;Teipel et al., 2007;Xie et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2007). However a few studies have shown no FA reduction in regional FA measures (Stahl et al., 2007) or FA reduction only limited in frontal WM (Choi et al., 2005), parietal WM (Sugihara et al., 2004), or unicinate fasciculus (Damoiseaux et al., 2009). In the present study, the significant FA reduction in the right parahippocampal white matter, bilateral uncinate fasciculus, and tracts in the brain stem and cerebellum in the subjects with MCI; while in AD patients the significant FA reduction was found in the right parahip- pocampal white matter, bilateral uncinate fasciculus, fornix, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, genu and splenium of corpus callosum, and tracts in the brain stem and cerebellum. Our results agree well with a recent TBSS study, in which the FA values of uncinate fasciculus, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, cingulum, splenium of the corpus callosum were significantly decreased in AD patients (Stricker et al., 2009). It is interesting that the reduced FA in the cerebellar tracts has not been reported in previous DTI studies in MCI subjects and AD patients. However, a neuropathological study (Joachim et al., 1989) has shown that cerebellum has diffuse senile plaques in AD patients, supporting our finding in cerebellum.\nBesides the differences in study populations (mild vs. moderate AD patients, amnestic MCI vs. multi-domain MCI), methodological factors in analysis of DTI data probably account for the majority of the discrepancies. The FA value obtained from a conventional ROI-analysis is largely affected by location and size of the ROIs; both being limiting factors in accuracy of ROI method since the ROI selection is often conducted without a prior knowledge about the exact location and extent of pathology. Indeed, our study showed that only subregions of fiber tracts were affected, indicating that the FA value measured from one selected ROI may not represent the integrity of the whole tract. The FA changes start at specific locations in specific structures which can partly explain the discrepancy in ROI-based studies in which different ROIs were used (Bozzali et al., 2002;Choi et al., 2005;Naggara et al., 2006;Stahl et al., 2007;Sugihara et al., 2004;Takahashi et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2007). Although the voxel-based analysis provides the ability to map the FA changes within the whole brain at once without a priori define ROIs it has been shown that the interpretability of the results from voxel-based DTI may sometimes be questionable (Bookstein, 2001;Davatzikos, 2004). The TBSS method used here overcomes the problems in the voxel-based DTI analysis in regards of alignment and spatial smoothing, and thus far seems to be a more accurate voxelwise analysis method when comparing multi-subject diffusion data (Smith et al., 2006).\nWe based our initial hypothesis of FA changes along the TBSS skeleton to the voxel-based uncorrected results (p  0.05 and 0.01) and further tested various methods to control over multiple comparison correction. Although the threshold-free cluster-enhancement (Smith and Nichols, 2007) method is designed to overcome the need to pre- determine the cluster-forming threshold the cluster-based inference (at t  2.7, p  0.05) was the only method that passed a cluster with significantly lower FA only in the genu of the corpus callosum in AD patients compared to controls. While acknowledging the need for multiple comparison correction to remove the inherent uncertainty in statistical analysis such as used here, we found, however, that the uncorrected TBSS output showed decreased FA in multiple white matter tracts in the MCI and AD patients compared to controls, which agree very well with neuropathological knowledge. Even though TBSS method has been applied in a few MCI and AD studies, there are discrepant findings when using different parameters (correction or uncorrection for multiple comparison and difference in p levels) (Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2008;Stricker et al., 2009), and the optimal parameters are still unknown. Our results are similar with the findings in a recent TBSS study (Stricker et al., 2009) as mentioned above. To overcome the methodological problems in automated cluster-level testing, we conducted a ROI-based analysis on a group level to quantitatively assess the observed FA decreases between the three groups.\nThe TBSS procedure, namely the registration and projection of individual FA data to the common skeleton, enabled us to apply the ROIs in the same size and to the same anatomical locations for each subject along the TBSS skeleton thus avoiding commonly problematic user-dependency in hand drawn ROIs. Furthermore, TBSS uncorrected results were used to (1) navigate to the locations of brain areas affected and (2) to decide the size of ROIs. In this context it is important to notice that our ROI-method differ from the conventional ROI-analysis. In general the findings in the ROI-based analysis agree well with those of TBSS method in the present study, especially between AD and control groups. Because the locations and sizes of the ROIs were navigated through worst-case changes and were subsequently applied in all groups and contained whole structures and not only those voxels highlighted in TBSS statistics, in some of the comparisons between more severely affected hemisphere and the contralateral side, or when MCI patients were tested against the other groups the FA differences did not reach the significant level. As shown in the Table 3, statistical difference in quantitative ROI-derived FA values between the controls and AD patients exist, whereas in MCI the FA values in all analyzed structures are found in between the controls and AD patients suggesting the progression of the disease. In agreement with previous, statistical analysis provided by TBSS protocol clearly showed that the areas with decreased FA increase in size as a function of progressing disease. By using single sized ROIs in each structure over all the studied groups we were unable to address whether the disease progression is manifested as an expansion of pathological area along the degenerating tract or whether there is gradual decline in FA values over the whole ROI area. However, FA decline in quantitative ROI-analysis combined with observed increase of pathological area in TBSS statistics strongly supports the expansion hypothesis. Indeed, in such case ROIs in MCI patients would contain voxels both from healthy and diseased tissue subsequently averaging out the effect of FA decrease in comparisons with controls and AD patients.\nOne of the most interesting findings of our study is the changes in FA were asymmetric between left and right hemispheres in MCI subjects and AD patients. The reduction in FA in the parahippocampal white matter, uncinate fasciculus, and anterior arch of fornix were only in right side or more extensive on the right side than on the left side, however, the FA reduction of SLF was dominant in the left side in AD patients. The side-dominant phenomenon of FA reduction in fiber tracts has no apparent explanation yet. Recent two DTI studies with TBSS showed left side dominance in FA reduction in the unicinate fasciculus (Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Stricker et al., 2009) and in SLF (Stricker et al., 2009). The left dominance in FA reduction of SLF is in line with our finding. However, the finding in the unicinate fasciculus is controversial to ours. The leftward or rightward asymmetry in MCI and AD patients is also controversial in volumetric studies. Many volumetric studies have showed leftward asymmetric hippocampal atrophy in AD patients. However, there were indeed volumetric studies showing that MCI and AD individuals have asymmetric atrophy in the medial temporal lobe, only present or more severe on the right side (Busatto et al., 2003;Pennanen et al., 2005). Moreover, cortical atrophy is now thought to be the result of cell shrinkage rather than a decrease in neuronal number (Kemper, 1994;Uylings et al., 2000). Even though the leftward hippocampal atrophy has been reported in the most studies, it cannot rule out the possibility that only the right parahippocampal tract shows FA reduction. A recent study showed white matter pathology isolates the hippocampal formation in AD (Salat et al., 2008). The asymmetric FA reduction in right side implies that the course of pathological changes might differ between the left and right sides. Because the different combinations of changes in axial and radial diffusivities, can result in quiet different, from decreased to increased, FA values. FA parameter alone maybe not be enough to investigate the detailed WM pathological change. FA evaluation combined with axial and radial diffusivities would be helpful in this purpose (Salat et al., 2008).\nThe present study has certain limitations. In the present study, presences of periventricular or deep white matter hyperintensities were not exclusive criteria, this may have influenced our results. We used 5-mm thick slice in our DTI data. The DTI data were then converted into 1-mm mean FA and skeleton maps. The FA changes less than 5-mm in z axis direction can therefore not be reliably evaluated due to the space resolution limit, this limitation is more prominent when evaluating small tracts (e.g., the fornix). Study has shown that the non-isotropic voxel dimensions can underestimate the FA in areas with crossing fibers (Oouchi et al., 2007). It may additionally confound the calculation of the FA, especially given the procedure for TBSS to reslice the low resolution voxels to 1 mm  1 mm  1 mm isotropic data in the present study. However, when ROIs were back-projected to the native space, they were on the similar locations compared to the locations on skeleton map in each subject, and the FA values that extracted from the skeleton maps and native space agreed reasonably well. Furthermore, we defined that the abnormalities were true only if the abnormal voxels were continuous and more than 5 mm in length. This might somehow minimize the limitation of slice thickness. In addition, by using the same set of ROIs to extract FA values from the three groups in the same locations, FA analysis for each group have exactly the same resolution caused by the partial volume effect and non-isotropic effect. When the FA values were compared among the three groups, this seems to minimize the effect as well. Our findings agree well with our neuropathological knowledge, and are further enhanced by our FA ROI-analysis.\nOur data suggest that the voxel-based analysis with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics is a promising method for examining the degeneration of neurofiber tracts in AD and MCI patients. The degeneration extensively involves neurofiber tracts already in the early phase of AD, and progressively deteriorates. The tracts degenerate asymmetrically in some structures in the left and right hemispheres.",

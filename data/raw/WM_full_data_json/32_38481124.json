    "abstract": "Sports-related concussions may cause white matter injuries and persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). We hypothesized that athletes with PPCS would have neurocognitive impairments and white matter abnormalities that could be revealed by advanced neuroimaging using ultra-high field strength diffusion tensor (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis (DKI) imaging metrics and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. A cohort of athletes with PPCS severity limiting the ability to workstudy and participate in sport school andor social activities for 6 months completed 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (morphological T1-weighed volumetry, DTI and DKI), extensive neuropsychological testing, symptom rating, and CSF biomarker sampling. Twenty-two athletes with PPCS and 22 controls were included. Concussed athletes performed below norms and significantly lower than controls on all but one of the psychometric neuropsychology tests. Supratentorial white and gray matter, as well as hippocampal volumes did not differ between concussed athletes and controls. However, of the 72 examined white matter tracts, 16 of DTI and 35 of DKI metrics (in total 28) were significantly different between concussed athletes and controls. DKI fractional anisotropy and axial kurtosis were increased, and DKI radial diffusivity and radial kurtosis decreased in concussed athletes when compared with controls. CSF neurofilament light (NfL; an axonal injury marker), although not glial fibrillary acidic protein, correlated with several diffusion metrics. In this first 7T DTI and DKI study investigating PPCS, widespread microstructural alterations were observed in the white matter, correlating with CSF markers of axonal injury. More white matter changes were observed using DKI than using DTI. These white matter alterations may indicate persistent pathophysiological processes following concussion in sport.",

      "text": "Acute symptoms following sports-related concussion (SRC) include physical, cognitive, and emotional disturbances that commonly subside within 7-14 days after injury. 1 However, 10-30 of athletes develop persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS), 2,3 which include neurocognitive deficits and impaired long-term mental health and quality of life. 4,5 Although there is no consensus or gold standard for the definition of PPCS, which varies among studies, the diagnosis is often based on symptom rating (e.g. using self-report rating scales) with symptoms persisting beyond the normal recovery time. 2 There are growing concerns that several mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) and SRCs may initiate a long-term neurodegenerative process in the brain, associated with white matter (WM) pathology. 6,7 However, often there is an absence of gross structural pathology on conventional neuroimaging. 8 Presumably, subtle abnormalities may be detected by advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques at higher field strengths. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an imaging technique that sensitizes the images to the microstructure of brain tissue by probing the diffusional motion of water molecules. 9 Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension to DTI that may be more sensitive to microstructural changes. It not only provides measures of the average diffusivity and anisotropy, but also measures the diffusional kurtosis, which reflects the degree to which the microstructure is heterogeneous. 10,11 DTI and DKI have been evaluated in SRC 12131415 and PPCS 16,17 and have been found to provide imaging metrics related to prolonged symptoms 18 and impaired results on neuropsychology tests. 12,1920212223 In fact, the risk of developing PPCS was predicted by DTI and DKI metrics at 72 h post-injury, 18 and DTI and DKI may provide neurobiological and microstructural correlates to SRC-induced symptoms. However, none of the previous DTI or DKI studies examined the use of ultra-high field strength (  7T). At 7T, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of DTI are supposed to be enhanced when compared to 3T-DTI. 242526 Apart from imaging, there is also a vast interest in biomarkers for SRC, aimed at diagnosis, assessment of injury severity, and outcome prediction. Increased levels of neurofilament light (NfL), a component of the cytoskeleton of large-caliber myelinated axons, correlate with persistent symptoms following SRC. 27 Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrogliosis, 28 also increases over the short and long term following SRC. 29,30 Acute blood biomarker levels have been shown to correlate with WM atrophy and DTI measures of axonal injury, 30 and biomarker levels are associated with DTI metrics. 31 However, the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP or NfL levels and DKI parameters has not previously been evaluated.\nThe multifaceted symptoms experienced by PPCS athletes, caused by heterogeneous injury mechanism, cannot be explained by a single injury mechanisms and multimodal assessment including neuropsychology. CSF biomarker and neuroimaging studies are required. Therefore, in the present explorative study, we evaluated the neurocognitive and mental health outcomes in athletes with SRC and PPCS for 6 months, and explored measures of atrophy using 7T MRI volumetry and measures of tissue microstructure using 7T DTI and DKI. For inclusion, symptom severity should prevent participation in sports, and limit work, school, or regular social activities. We choose to include DTI and DKI metrics in all WM areas of the brain to provide a study of WM microstructure in SRC athletes to assess the additive value of ultra-high field DTI and DKI on mild TBI research. We also evaluated CSF biomarkers of astrogliosis and axonal injury.",

De-noising was performed using Marchenko-Pastur principal component analysis. 54 For mitigating Gibbs-ringing artefacts we used the method proposed by Kellner and coworkers. 55 Brain extraction was performed with the use of a T1-weighted brain mask that was extracted via the advanced normalization tools (ANTs) brain extraction scheme. 56 Once a brain mask was extracted from the T1-weighted volume, the b-zero volume (b  0 secmm 2 ) was rigidly registered onto the T1-weighted volume using the ANTs rigid registration scheme, 57 and then the inverse transformation matrix was used to bring the brain mask onto the DTI or DKI space. Motion and eddy currents correction was applied using the eddy method provided by FSL. 58 Geometric distortions were corrected using topup by FSL. 59 In cases of remaining artefacts not mitigated by the aforementioned processing steps, the specific scan was excluded from the analysis. DTI parameters were estimated through DTIFIT in FSL using weighted linear least squares. 60 DKI parameters were computed using the package dipy and its module DiffusionKurtosisModel, using weighted linear least squares in the fitting. 10 For both DTI and DKI, the two b-zero volumes were not included in the model fitting. Median filtering with a kernel size of three was applied to the three kurtosis parameters (i.e., mean, axial, and radial kurtosis), following their initial computation, in order to mitigate the issue with the black voxels in DKI. 61 To obtain tract-specific diffusion parameter values, WM tract segmentation was performed using TractSeg, 62 which automatically segments 72 major WM tracts.

Data were analyzed for normal or skewed distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test and histograms and presented using means and standard deviations (SD) if normally distributed and with medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) if skewed, nominal, or categorical. Because of the limited sample size, non-parametric tests were chosen for all analyses; v 2 tests if categorical or binominal, Mann-Whitney U test if the data were nominal or continuous, and for correlations, Spearmans coefficient (r s ) were calculated.\nFor calculating differences in subject characteristics, if normally distributed and with medians and IQRs if skewed, nominal, or v 2 tests were used for sex, occupation status, and housing situation, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for age and years of education. Neuropsychological measures were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U tests, using raw scores for comparisons between SRC athletes and controls. In addition, to determine any deviations from normal populations, raw scores from the cognitive tests (RBANS, d2, SDMT, and WAIS-IV) and the self-report inventory of executive functioning, BRIEF-A, were converted into standard Z-scores, derived from test-specific age-related published norms. Manifestation of cognitive difficultiesdeficits was defined by results À1.5 Z; that is, 1.5 SD below normative means for each measure, 65 corresponding approximately to 6.7 in the general population. Volumetric and diffusion data were compared across groups using Mann-Whitney U tests. The significance threshold was set to 0.05.\nCorrections for multiple comparison were not done in this explorative study. To mitigate the problem of multiple comparisons, however, we compared the number of significant tests to the corresponding one computed under the null hypothesis using a permutation test, as previously proposed. 66,67 In this analysis, the test statistic was defined as the number of tracts that displayed significant differences in their medians. For each permutation, the labels of the two groups were randomly permuted after which a U test was performed for each tract. Using 10 4 permutations, this generated a distribution of the number of tracts with significant differences, under the null hypothesis. The exact p value was computed as the relative fraction for which the number of significant tracts from the permutation analysis was higher than the number of significant tracts with the true labels. Using the results of the permutation analysis, we also computed the 95th percentile of the number of tracts that was significant under the null hypothesis. This number can be considered as a significance threshold: for parameters with fewer significant tracts, all significant tracts for that parameter may be considered as false positives. For parameters with a higher number of significant tracts, some but not all of the significant tracts can be considered as false positives. The permutation analysis was repeated for significance thresholds (a) in the per-tract U tests of 0.05 and 0.01.\nEffect sizes were calculated for differences between SRC athletes and controls in the DTI and DKI metrics.\nEffects sizes above 0.64 or below À0.64 were considered significant, as the 95 confidence interval of effect sizes in the absence of a true effect spans this range for our group sizes. 68",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study investigated neurocognitive functioning, structural abnormalities in GM and WM, and CSF biomarkers in a well-characterized group of athletes with long-lasting PPCS. Our main findings were that despite having no gross findings on routine clinical neuroimaging, SRC athletes had marked deficits on neuropsychological functioning and showed evidence of widespread structural changes in a large proportion of WM tracts when studied by 7T DKI. Further, the axonal injury marker NfL correlated with several of the diffusion metrics. These findings indicate that advanced neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers are needed to explore the extent of WM abnormalities following SRC.\nThe SRC athletes had sustained a median of five SRCs, reported a high symptom burden at the time of investigation, and would meet the ICD-10 criteria for postconcussion syndrome. The symptoms included elevated ratings of depression, anxiety, and mental fatigue; subjective experiences of executive dysfunction; and impaired life satisfaction. The enrollment of the PPCS cohort could, as a result of self-selection, have introduced a bias with symptoms unrelated to SRC-induced factors but instead caused by mental health concerns. We regard this as unlikely because no elite athlete had any preexisting mental health issues and the PPCS were continuous, without symptom-free periods post-concussion. Moreover, the causes of PPCS may be multifactorial, and psychological processes and pre-injury factors could contribute. 69 We argue that biological processes are indeed present at prolonged times post-injury, supported by recent findings from our group. 70 Our results revealed deficits in neuropsychological functioning, particularly in the domains of immediate memory, verbal abilities, and attentional functions. Compared with controls, SRC athletes performed significantly worse on all psychometric measures except the Digit span working memory test. Several factors other than SRCs can influence perceived mental health, such as SRC-induced post-traumatic stress and not being able to continue sport participation or attend work, studies, or social events to the same extent as previously. Although other factors may contribute to mental health issues, given the extent of structural abnormalities on 7T DKI, we argue that the observed WM abnormalities may give rise to neurobiologically based dysregulation of emotional homeostasis following SRC. 71 The microstructural alterations detected with 7T DKI in this group of symptomatic SRC athletes at an average time of 2.6 years since their last SRC suggest persisting, or even evolving neuropathology in the WM, as supported by our CSF NfL data. At the time of SRC, rotational forces cause tension in WM tracts, and this axonal stretch may lead to axonal beading, 72 which may explain increased AK. 15,73 Axonal beading is the accumulation of varicosities along the axis of an axon, which may be caused by a tensiondriven destabilization of microtubules. 74 The theory of axonal beading is further strengthened and argued for in an animal model of mTBI, where an increase in AK and MK was seen. 75 Neurodegenerative processes tend to yield reduced FA. However, increased FA in SRC as observed in our present study has been observed previously. In our study we observed increased DKI FA and AK, and decreased RD and RK, which may be evidence of axonal beading, gliosis, and astrogliosis supported by a postmortem study of athletes with previous SRCs. 76 Other mechanisms such as Wallerian degeneration, a concomitant inflammatory response, and SRC-induced neurodegeneration may also contribute. 777879 However, this needs verification by histopathological evaluation. The correlation between NfL and several DTI and DKI metrics argues for an ongoing axonal injury process rather than astrogliosis as an explanation of the altered diffusion metrics. Recently, serum NfL and GFAP levels were evaluated over several years following injury, 30 and whereas NfL and GFAP correlated with WM atrophy and DTI measures of axonal injury, the prognostic utility of GFAP was inferior to that of NfL. 30 The correlations between diffusion metrics and the axonal injury marker NfL indicate a progressive axonal injury process. The microstructural changes found in this study were widespread in the WM and present in long tracts, central structures, and in both hemispheres, and were mainly supratentorial. In previous studies, a general pattern of abnormalities was observed, 13,15 which was expected in view of the rotational forces causing global WM tract shearing.",

      "text": "GARD ET AL.\nIn the diffusion analysis, DKI yielded higher effect sizes than DTI (see the average rows in Fig. 4). Diffusion MRI (DTI or DKI) metrics characterize alternations in WM morphology, described by water diffusivity within the WM tracts. Our results indicate that DKI is more sensitive in the evaluation of PPCS athletes than DTI; however, the merit of DKI over DTI can only be appreciated when both protocols are implemented equally. DKI is a more demanding protocol than DTI (multishell acquisition, higher b-values, necessitates diffusion encoding with longer gradient pulses), and therefore, DKI is performed with longer echo times than DTI, which reduces the baseline SNR ratio. This is often compensated for by reducing the spatial resolution in DKI compared with DTI. In such a case, DKI might not demonstrate any additive values compared with DTI, and to date we cannot firmly argue that DKI should replace DTI in clinical routine. A different observation when comparing DTI with DKI was reported in a study on SRC athletes, in which MD differed from DTI more extensively across the WM skeleton than any DKI parameter. 80 A possible explanation is that the DTI protocol featured fewer diffusion encodings than the DKI protocol (36 and 52, respectively), which therefore leads to a slight disadvantage in terms of protocol performance. However, previous studies investigating what effect the number of gradient directions has on the accuracy of directionsensitive diffusion parameters such as FA, AD, and RD showed that above a certain number of directions ( 25) the accuracy does not improve substantially from an increased number of encoding directions. 81 Despite the high sensitivity of DTI and DKI to detect signs of microstructural alterations in SRC, there is considerable ambiguity between studies, showing both increases and decreases in the same metrics. 121314151617182021222373 Some of the ambiguity can probably be explained by the diversity in which metrics were acquired and analyzed and at which post-injury time points and in which populations they were evaluated. DTI and DKI metrics change over time with the pathology, and studies indicate that metrics can evolve over time, or return to normal levels. 22,23,27,28 The modalities differ in sensitivity, 15,18,21,73 and can be sensitive to different changes at different time points. 17,23 Most SRC studies have a male dominance or only include men, 131415 and there may be important sex differences. In a previous mTBI study, significantly different DTI metrics compared with controls were only observed in symptomatic patients and not in the asymptomatic group. 16 Similarly, a study of DTI and DKI following mTBI revealed differences to controls at 72 h and 3 months, and when stratifying based on symptoms at 3 months, symptomatic patients had signs of pathology not present in the asymptomatic group. 17 In another study, the risk of developing PPCS could be predicted using DTI and DKI metrics at 72 h post-injury. 18 Further, microstructural alterations have been shown to extend beyond symptom resolution in SRC athletes. 13,15 This is evidence of a high sensitivity to microstructural change following SRC, with impairments observed even in symptom-free athletes, and more impairments observed in athletes with prolonged symptoms. DTI and DKI, with the addition of NfL, may therefore aid in determining the neurobiological correlates, and which athletes may be at risk of prolonged symptoms.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "The present study evaluates a rather small, yet highly characterized cohort of SRC athletes with PPCS 6 months. However, this cohort may not be representative of all SRC athletes. The discrepancies in cognitive performances between SRC athletes and our control group may have been enhanced by factors other than SRCs. Although matched by age and sex, the controls had more years of education, which is related to better psychometric performance. 82 Still, the majority of SRC athletes in the present study demonstrated cognitive difficulties by deviating from test-specific norms. The level of education in the SRC group is consistent with the mean years of education in the United States and Sweden -from where norms are obtained. The PPCS severity may have contributed to impaired ability for higher education and therefore have contributed to the lower level of education observed in our athlete cohort.\nAlthough CSF sampling in PPCS athletes is rare, we acknowledge the limitations caused by the small sample size and the fact that CSF sampling was not conducted in our control cohort (it was not permitted by the ethical committee). Therefore, our study may lack statistical power in detecting correlations using the CSF biomarker findings. It should be noted that our included cohort displayed a very high symptom severity and number of symptoms, although as SCAT symptoms were not obtained from our control cohort, direct comparisons cannot be made. T1-weighed imaging, DTI, and DKI may have benefited from the increased SNR at 7T. However, T1-weighted imaging at 7T is known to occasionally suffer from increased B1 inhomogeneity with artefacts in low signal intensity regions, mainly in the temporal lobes. 83 Such specific artefacts were present in two athletes and three controls in our study, which led to their exclusion from the volumetric analysis.\nMultiple comparisons, not corrected for, may lead to a risk of statistical type II error. We acknowledge that the absence of such corrections may increase the risk of type II errors, although we argue against the differences being merely caused by false positives. First, in this exploratory study, we performed a permutation analysis that showed that the number of tracts showing significant differences between SRC athletes and controls were larger than expected from chance alone for many of the DKI parameters. Second, we introduced the single WM ROI, which also displayed significant differences across the groups. Regardless, a larger PPCS cohort could have enabled stronger conclusions, although this would have been difficult in view of the narrow inclusion criteria.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "In this study, persistent symptoms following SRC were associated with several neurocognitive impairments as well as signs of depression, anxiety, mental fatigue, executive dysfunction, and impaired life satisfaction. We found evidence of widespread WM microstructural alterations on DKI. The correlation of WM abnormalities on DKI and CSF NfL levels, but not GFAP, points toward an important role for an ongoing axonal injury process in PPCS athletes.",

    "Transparency, Rigor, and Reproducibility Summary": {
      "text": "The study and the analysis plan were not formally preregistered, although the analysis plan was pre-specified in the study planning. A sample size of 40-50 subjects, SRC athletes and controls equally distributed, was planned based on the limited availability of Swedish SRC athletes meeting the strict inclusion criteria. The included sample size was 22 subjects per group (please see Table S3 for further details). The licensed neuropsychologist conducting the assessments was aware of the clinical status of the (SRC athletes or healthy controls) but blinded to the neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers results. Participants were unable to guess the results of their assessments, as the results were analyzed after their last clinical evaluation, whereafter the participants were informed about their neuropsychology results and provided with recommendations when appropriate. Data collection and processing of MRI data were performed by investigators unaware of relevant participants characteristics (medical history, neuropsychology, and lumbar puncture). Data were labeled using codes linked to participant identifying information.\nBecause of the limited sample size and particular patient features, making it impossible to blind the data, the data analysis (statistics) was performed by investigators who were aware of relevant characteristics of the participants. Data were acquired between June 2018 and June 2020, Monday to Fridays between 7:30 and 16:30. Data were collected with subjects well rested, starting with neuropsychology, followed by MRI, with the lumbar puncture being the last procedure during the day. All data sets were analyzed at the same time using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Version 25, IBM, New York) with methods specified in the Methods section. Specific equipment and software used to perform acquisition and analysis are widely available or may be available upon request from each specific company and The National 7T facility at Lund University Bioimaging. The key inclusion criteria for PPCS varies in the literature 2 although they are typically, as in our present study, based on symptom duration and severity. The primary clinical outcome measures (PPCS symptoms, neuropsychology, DTIDKI metrics, and blood or, as used here, CSF biomarkers) are increasingly used in this research field but may not be widely established as standards. The statistical tests used were based on the testing for normality non-normality and sample size. Statistical analysis and review were performed by the authors (A.G., M.N., N.M.) with qualifications including specific statistical training and expertise. Correction for multiple comparison was not performed, which is described in detail in the Statistical analysis and Discussion sections. Replication by the study group and external validation are ongoing. De-identified data from this study are not available in a public archive but may be received from the authors upon reasonable request. Analytical codes used to conduct the analyses presented in this study are not available in a public repository.",

    "abstract": "Primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) is a clinical syndrome in which apraxia of speech is the initial indication of neurodegenerative disease. Prior studies of PPAOS have identified hypometabolism, grey matter atrophy, and white matter tract degeneration in the frontal gyri, precentral cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA). Recent clinical observations suggest two distinct subtypes of PPAOS may exist. Phonetic PPAOS is characterized predominantly by distorted sound substitutions. Prosodic PPAOS is characterized predominantly by slow, segmented speech. Demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data (MRI, DTI, and FDG-PET) were analyzed to validate these subtypes and explore anatomic correlates. The Phonetic subtype demonstrated bilateral involvement of the SMA, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus. The Prosodic subtype demonstrated more focal involvement in the SMA and right superior cerebellar peduncle. The findings provide converging evidence that differences in the reliably determined predominant clinical characteristics of AOS are associated with distinct imaging patterns, independent of severity.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "In 1967, Darley described a motor speech disorder characterized by varying combinations of slow speaking rate, syllable segmentation, abnormal prosody, distorted sound substitutions, additions, and prolongations, sometimes accompanied by groping and trial and error articulatory movements (Darley, 1967(Darley, , 1969) ) The disorder was termed apraxia of speech (AOS), a motor speech disorder reflecting a problem with the planning andor programming of speech. AOS is well recognized in the context of stroke, where onset is acute and the condition improves or becomes stable and chronic (McNeil, Robin,  Schmidt, 2009). AOS that is insidious in onset and progresses over time because of neurodegeneration is less well recognized and understood, although in recent years it has been recognized that AOS can be a feature, sometime a prominent feature, of the nonfluent or agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011;Ogar, Dronkers, Brambati, Miller,  Gorno-Tempini, 2007;Silveri et al., 2014).\nFor the past decade, patients with primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) patients have been the focus of a body of research. It has been demonstrated that AOS can be the earliest and sole manifestation of an underlying neurodegenerative disease; it was recently reported that the profile of PPAOS clinical characteristics can differ among affected patients (Josephs et al., 2014). In some cases, the speech pattern is dominated by distorted sound substitutions and additions, and other features attributable to articulatory difficulty, while in other cases the pattern is dominated by slow, prosodically segmented speech. The first profile has been designated as Phonetic (Articulatory) PPAOS and the second as Prosodic PPAOS previously referred to as type 1 and 2, respectively (Josephs et al., 2013). Importantly, it appears that the PPAOS pattern subtype may have prognostic implications. In a recent small longitudinal study, it was observed that, although not broken down by subtype, in some PPAOS patients the AOS remained the most prominent feature for an average of seven years. Other patients developed a severe extrapyramidal syndrome resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) within five years, causing significant morbidity. Interestingly, this more aggressive course was associated with the Prosodic subtype (Josephs et al., 2014). At present, little more is known about these subtypes, including how they initially present and if there are differences in demographic, neurologic, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological profiles.\nPrior studies of PPAOS, without regard to possible subtypes, have identified involvement of frontal gyri, precentral cortex, and SMA, with hypometabolism seen on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging (FDG-PET) (Josephs et al., 2012;Josephs et al., 2006), grey matter atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Josephs et al., 2013), and white matter tract degeneration on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Whitwell et al., 2013). In autopsy data, PPAOS is consistently associated with tau biochemistry and is thought to be a primary tauopathy. In fact, autopsy-confirmed cases of both corticobasal degeneration (Josephs et al., 2006;Josephs et al., 2016) and progressive supranuclear palsy (Josephs et al., 2005;Josephs  Duffy, 2008) have been reported in patients who presented with a progressive AOS. Currently, it is not understood whether these imaging profiles and autopsy findings are shared between the different clinical presentations of PPAOS.\nThe goals of the current study included 1) detailing the demographic and clinical profiles of the perceptually distinct Phonetic (Articulatory) and Prosodic subtypes of PPAOS, 2) establishing a quantitative profile of salient features (i.e. auditory and visual) of AOS, and 3) verifying the concurrent validity of the auditorily distinct subtypes through examination of neuroimaging findings (atrophy on MRI, white matter tract integrity on DTI, and hypometabolism on FDG-PET).",

    "Participants and Diagnostic Classification": {
      "text": "This study was approved by the Mayo Institutional Review Board. All participants consented to research. From September 2010 to January 2017, twenty-one participants diagnosed with Primary Progressive Apraxia of Speech ten Phonetic (Articulatory) PPAOS, hereafter referred to as Phonetic PPAOS; eleven Prosodic were seen as part of a larger study. All participants had unequivocal evidence of AOS, which was the first noted symptom, and were classified through a consensus meeting by two speech-language pathologists (JRD and HMCEAS), a neuropsychologist (MMM), and neurologist (KAJ). These individuals did not meet clinical criteria for any other neurologic diagnosis at initial testing including, but not limited to, progressive supranuclear palsy (Litvan et al., 1996;Respondek et al., 2013), corticobasal syndrome (Armstrong et al., 2013;Boeve, Lang,  Litvan, 2003), or Alzheimers disease dementia (Albert et al., 2011;Dubois et al., 2014;McKhann et al., 1984). Importantly, while these patients may technically meet criteria for the nonfluent agrammatic variant of PPA, they do not meet the requisite root criteria for PPA, as outlined in the consensus criteria (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011), as they were not aphasic.\nFor a clinical diagnosis of PPAOS, a patient must present with a chief complaint of progressive impairment of speech (i.e. AOS). Evidence of aphasia precludes a diagnosis of PPAOS. Dysarthria does not preclude a diagnosis of PPAOS, as long as the AOS is greater in severity. For this study, given that the goal was to examine the neuroimaging correlates of the different characteristics of AOS, patients with evidence of dysarthria (i.e., speech features consistent with any dysarthria type that do not overlap with features of AOS, such as strained voice quality, hypophonia, hypernasality, tremor) regardless of severity, were excluded to minimize confounded results. Additionally, participants were excluded if the AOS was too severe to validly and reliably to judge the presence or severity of the specific speech characteristics. Participant inclusion and exclusion are outlined in Figure 1. All participants were monolingual, with English as their native language. Of the 21 participants in this study, 15 (71) were included in previous studies and 6 (29) have not before been published.\nAdditionally, a cohort of 63 healthy, cognitively normal controls, without any neurologic deficits, was selected from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) as a control cohort for the imaging analyses. The MCSA is an epidemiological study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota (Petersen et al., 2010;Roberts et al., 2008). The PPAOS cohort was matched on age and gender with MCSA participants (3 controls: 1 patient), who were all amyloid-negative (SUVR  1.42) as determined by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET (Jack et al., 2013). All control and patient participants had 3-T volumetric MRI, DTI, FDG-PET, and PiB PET scans using identical acquisition parameters described in detail below (section 2.4).",

Non-verbal oral apraxia (NVOA) was assessed with an 8-item measure consisting of 4 gestures (cough, click your tongue, blow, smack your lips), each repeated twice. Each item received 0 to 4 points, with a score of 4 awarded for an immediate, accurate response; a score of 32 indicates no errors. Consistent with past research, a cutoff of 29 was used to establish the presence of NVOA (Botha et al., 2014).\nA clinical neuropsychologist (MMM) oversaw test administration, scoring accuracy, and quality control of neuropsychological assessment. Tests were selected to assess different domains of cognitive function and to complement the speech and language battery. Domains tested include motor speed Trail Making Test A (Spreen  Strauss, 1998), executive function (Trail Making Test B), visuospatial and visuoperceptual function Cube Analysis and Incomplete Letters of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP), respectively (Warrington  James, 1991), and visual constructional skills Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test (Rey-O) (Osterrieth, 1944;Rey, 1964).",

Judgments of speech included: (1) a 0-4 rating of AOS severity (1  mild; 4  severe), as an index of AOS severity regardless of its specific features, (2) a 1-10 rating (10  normal) of motor speech disorder severity MSD severity, adapted from (Yorkston, Strand, Miller,  Hillel, 1993), which indexed the degree to which speech is understandable (i.e. functional impairment), (3) the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale 3 (ASRS-3), detailed below (section 2.3.2), and (4) an Articulation Error Score (AES), also described below (section 2.3.3). Complete evaluations of oral structure and function were conducted. Strength, tone, and range of motion were normal, with no evidence of any associated dysarthria.\nLanguage measures included the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ) (Kertesz, 2007), which served as a composite measure of global language ability; it includes measures of repetition, naming, spontaneous speech fluency, word finding, grammatical competence, verbal and reading comprehension, and writing. A WAB-AQ score of 93.8 or above was considered normal, consistent with standard test guidelines. Grammar was assessed by review of conversational speech and verbal and written picture description tasks. The patients included in this study showed no evidence of agrammatism (e.g. omission of articles function words or syntax errors) in conversational speech, narrative picture description, and writing. The 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT) (Lansing, Ivnik, Cullum,  Randolph, 1999) served as a sensitive measure of confrontation naming ability; a score of 13 and above was considered normal. As some of the WAB subtests can be influenced by non-aphasic deficits, including, but not limited to, apraxia of speech, participants were required to perform below normal on at least two measures of language, including demonstration of agrammatism in spoken language or writing, poor scores on the BNT, or reduced WAB-AQ. No patients in this study met criteria for aphasia.",

      "text": "Assessment-Previous study of reliability for PPAOS subtype designation demonstrated 95 independent inter-rater agreement, with consensus achieved by the two SLPs after discussion on the remaining patients (Josephs et al., 2012). Additionally, a second independent consensus rating was achieved one-to-five years following initial consensus diagnosis. All patients included in this study were reliably rated as representative of each subtype at both consensus meetings. Specifically, a designation of Phonetic PPAOS was made if distorted sound substitutions or additions (often increasing in prominence with increased utterance length or syllable or word complexity) were judged to clearly dominate the speech pattern (i.e. were more prominent than the characteristics that dominate Prosodic PPAOS). A designation of Prosodic PPAOS was made if syllable segmentation or lengthened intersegment durations between syllables, words, or phrases were judged to clearly dominate the speech pattern (i.e. were more prominent than the characteristics that dominate Phonetic PPAOS). See Supplementary Videos for representative samples of each subtype. Importantly, the subtype designation is reflective of the pattern that predominates; it does not imply that it is the sole disruption of speech output. If there was no clear predominance of characteristics for Phonetic PPAOS or Prosodic PPAOS, the patient received a diagnosis of Mixed PPAOS (four patients were classified as Mixed and subsequently excluded from the current study). The presence, type, and severity of dysarthria were also assessed. To ensure any differences between groups were attributable to AOS, and not confounded by dysarthria, patients with any evidence of dysarthria were excluded from the study (See Figure 1).\nJudgments of PPAOS subtype were based on spoken responses to the Spontaneous Speech subtests of the WAB (answers to basic questions and a narrative picture description) and several supplementary motor speech tasks that included vowel prolongation, speech alternating motion rates (e.g. rapid repetition of puhpuhpuh), speech sequential motion rates (e.g. rapid repetition of puhtuhkuh), word and sentence repetition tasks, and a conversational speech sample. The tasks most important to the classification of PPAOS subtype include narrative speech (picture description) and repetition of sentences and words of increasing length and phonetic complexity. The combination of these sources of speech responses allows for reliable judgments of PPAOS subtype (Josephs et al., 2013). The consensus classification of PPAOS subtype was made by the perceptual judgment of speech characteristics only; the primary rater who conducted the speech and language examination presented video recordings of the speech exam and the second rater was blinded to the examiners judgments.",

    "Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale-3 (ASRS-3": {
      "text": ")-To provide a quantified description of the characteristics of AOS, the ASRS-3 was used to rate the presence or absence, relative prominence, and severity of associated characteristics (see Appendix). An earlier version of the ASRS-3 was used in previous studies of progressive AOS (Duffy et al., 2017;Duffy et al., 2015;Josephs et al., 2013;Josephs et al., 2012). The total ASRS-3 score can range from 0 to 52 (where 0  no abnormal speech characteristics); it captures the severity of AOS but does not capture the specific quality of the AOS. For this study, those items that capture the salient features (i.e. auditory and visual) associated with each subtype were of particular interest. Toward that end, the sum of scores for the four items that best capture phonetic (articulatory) problems (items 1-4) minus the sum of scores for the four items that best capture prosodic abnormalities (items 5-8) was used to quantify the degree to which articulatory and prosodic abnormalities differed, and to further assess the reliability and validity of the non-quantified judgment of PPAOS subtype. In addition to showing the wide range of variability, this composite score minimizes the need for multiple comparisons and allows us to interpret the relative predominance of characteristics, independent of severity (i.e. value of the individual phonetic and prosodic variables).",

This error score may underestimate total abnormalities within and across words because a word scored as incorrect might contain more than one error, and because distortions that did not cross phonemic boundaries were not scored as incorrect. In general, it is expected that the AES score, on average, will be higher in the Phonetic group, capturing the predominance of their articulatory errors.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The study supports previous work establishing that neurodegenerative AOS can exist in the absence of aphasia, dysarthria, or any neurological abnormalities that meet criteria for other neurodegenerative disease (e.g., CBS, PSP). While there are no population prevalence estimates for PPAOS, a recent review suggests that 20 of patients diagnosed with the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), progressive nonfluent aphasia, or PPA-not otherwise specified, had little to no evidence of aphasia, but rather an isolated apraxia of speech (Duffy, Strand,  Josephs, 2014). These patients would be more accurately classified as PPAOS. The abnormal speech characteristics identified in this study are consistent with features commonly associated with AOS due to stroke and other nonneurodegenerative causes (Ballard et al., 2015;Duffy, 2013;Duffy  Josephs, 2014;McNeil et al., 2009). Although previous work has raised the possibility of subtypes of strokeinduced AOS (Kent  Rosenbek, 1983) and neurodegenerative AOS (Josephs et al., 2013), the current study is the first to formally examine and validate two clinically distinguishable subtypes of PPAOS. That is, the two primary problems reflected in broad characterizations of AOS -articulation and prosody -can be perceptually dissociated to varying degrees in PPAOS, as demonstrated by the differences in ratings of a number of phonetic and prosodic features on the ASRS-3. Difference in overall severity between the phonetic and prosodic subtypes is an unlikely explanation for the subtype differences because neither global AOS severity ratings nor ratings of functional impairment differed between the two subtype groups. It is possible that the two subtypes may be most easily appreciated at mild-moderate levels of severity, as seen in this cohort; the distinction may blur (as it does with variants of primary progressive aphasia) as PPAOS becomes more severe.",

      "text": "The different manifestations of AOS in this cohort were reliably detected by independent raters and during consensus meetings; this reliability is critical because the clinical identification of the salient features (i.e. auditory and visual) of AOS served as the gold standard for this study. The sub-scores of the ASRS-3, designed to quantify the presence and severity of different aspects of AOS, support the gestalt diagnosis, such that all patients designated as Prosodic had higher Prosody sub-scores and nine of ten Phonetic patients had higher Phonetic sub-scores. The data supports the notion that the extent of Prosodic and Phonetic differences can vary among patients, reflected in the wide range of Phonetic-Prosody composite score on the ASRS-3. It is hypothesized that as severity of AOS increases, the distinction between the subtypes may blur, but this must be assessed through longitudinal study. The notion of subtypes described here serves as a starting point; it is not proposed that the predominant perceptual features occur in isolation, but rather that their predominance early in the disease course may herald the condition to follow. That is, the subtypes may predict the nature or rate of disease evolution and the type of additional deficits that may eventually emerge (Josephs et al., 2014).\nThe Prosodic patients, on average, were significantly older than the Phonetic patients. Research on healthy aging suggests that different areas in the speech-language network may vary in their vulnerability to natural senescence (notably white and gray matter changes in the inferior frontal cortex and to a lesser extent the premotor cortex) (Yang et al., 2014). Such an interaction between age and disease pathophysiology is seen in Alzheimers disease, where the same pathology results in different clinical presentations, strongly associated with age (Barnes et al., 2015;Dickerson, Brickhouse, McGinnis,  Wolk, 2016). By extension, one hypothesis for the PPAOS subgroup differences might be that they reflect an interaction between similar pathophysiology (e.g., tau pathology within the speech planningprogramming network) and age-related vulnerability in somewhat different portions of that network.\nIt is important to note that at initial presentation, there were no differences in language function between the two subgroups; no member in either group had aphasia. This supports considering PPAOS as a distinct entity of motor planning and programming and not a disorder of language (Josephs et al., 2012). While the Phonetic group had lower scores on the MOCA, a measure of general cognition; the mechanism for this difference was largely from the subsection of the MOCA that requires repetition of phrases (a total of 2 points for this section). To receive points, the patient must provide an exact repetition of two lengthy sentences. No points are awarded if there are any errors, including unintelligible responses. While this was intended to reflect cognitive and language abilities, it is possible this is biased against the Phonetic patients whose sound level (articulatory) errors were responsible for lower scores on this task. Prosodic patients, whose rate and rhythm are abnormal, while articulation is relatively preserved, carry an advantage to complete this task free of error. However, while the MOCA score differences may have been contaminated by the specific characteristics of speech difficulties, such difficulties are unlikely to account for the trend toward differences in the neuropsychiatric inventory-questionnaire, designed to index behavioral or other psychiatric symptoms. While none of the PPAOS patients had a formal diagnosis of behavioral or other psychiatric problems, two of the eleven Prosodic patients and five of the ten Phonetic patients had scores ranging from four to nine (ten or above reflects the presence neuropsychiatric deficits). This trend may portend development of other behavioral or cognitive changes among patients with Phonetic PPAOS, such as anxiety and depression. Finally, the data support that NVOA occurs frequently, but not invariably, with PPAOS (Botha et al., 2014;Josephs et al., 2012), but without differences between the Phonetic and Prosodic subgroups.\nAlthough not statistically different between the subgroups, there was an overall higher presence of impaired motor function in the Prosodic group, as reflected in their higher UPDRS III scores. These higher scores are primarily attributable to slowing and reduced amplitude of extremity AMRs (finger, hand, pronation, toe tap, and leg). A final observation is a difference in inclusion and exclusion features that yielded the sample for the study. There were a larger number of patients with Prosodic PPAOS who were excluded because of co-occurring dysarthria (seven of eighteen patients with Prosodic PPAOS, without aphasia) compared to Phonetic PPAOS (two of twelve patients with Phonetic AOS, without aphasia). This is a possible consequence of the aforementioned decline in motor function that appears more prominent in the Prosodic group. Perhaps this reflects the finding of a longitudinal study that suggests a subset of PPAOS patients evolve to a syndrome reminiscent of progressive supranuclear palsy (Josephs et al., 2014). This likely will be clarified through longitudinal study of the evolution of deficits within and between the subgroups.",

    "Imaging Findings": {
      "text": "The literature has documented consistent patterns of hypometabolism on FDG-PET (Josephs et al., 2012;Josephs et al., 2006), atrophy on MRI, and white matter tract degeneration on diffusion tensor imaging (Whitwell et al., 2013) in patients with PPAOS compared to controls. The current study supports this converging evidence while at the same time suggesting that these global imaging patterns may differ depending on the specific profile of the speech deficits (i.e., PPAOS subtypes).\nA consistently shared imaging finding between the PPAOS subtypes is the involvement of premotor regions, in particular the SMA. The SMA has a known role in the preparation and initiation of voluntary movements, including speech (Duffy, 2013). Specifically, the SMA has been implicated in the transition between the conceptualization of a word to different aspects of speech production, including articulation and prosody (Hertrich, Dietrich,  Ackermann, 2016). In addition to experimental findings, theories of speech motor control also recognize the SMA as influencing the initiation of speech (Tourville  Guenther, 2011). It is unclear if further parcellation of the SMA to the pre-SMA (anterior portion) and SMA proper would provide further insight; some data suggest the pre-SMA is differentially involved in the earlier, higher levels of motor planning (Alario, Chainay, Lehericy,  Cohen, 2006). In the future, larger sample sizes, and finer-grained imaging analyses, will allow us to make more confident estimations of relative contributions of different portions of the SMA to disrupted aspects of speech production in PPAOS.\nThe results seen on MRI, FDG, and DTI in the Phonetic group suggest bilateral involvement, spanning the frontal gyri, precentral cortex, and SMA. This relatively widespread involvement is a possible harbinger for behavior, language, and cognitive changes in the Phonetic group (discussed above). This is unlikely to purely reflect clinical severity, as there were no significant differences between the two subgroups on the AOS severity rating and ASRS totals, intended to capture the severity of the apraxia of speech, nor on the MSD severity rating, intended to capture the severity of the associated functional impairment. In fact, the Prosodic group demonstrated worse overall ASRS totals. This supports the notion that the more diffuse anatomical involvement in the Phonetic group yields a difference in the quality of impairment and not the severity of the impairment. Further, the FDG analyses showed hypometabolism in the insula in the Phonetic group that was not seen in the Prosodic group. In the stroke literature, insular damage has been linked to AOS (Ogar et al., 2006). While prosodic versus articulatory differences have not been explicitly addressed in other studies of AOS, general descriptions suggest that strokeinduced AOS may be predominated by articulatory errors versus prosodic errors, or that the AOS is mixed in the distribution of phonetic and prosodic features (Dronkers, 1996). At this time, descriptions of the quality of AOS associated with stroke is somewhat lacking in the literature; formal comparison of the speech features of stroke-induced and degenerative AOS warrants continued study.\nThere are some limitations to this current study. The inherent age difference in the cohorts suggests comparing each clinical subtype to their respective age-sex matched controls is the best means to ameliorate any potential age effects. For this reason, as well as the underpowered sample, direct imaging comparisons between the PPAOS types were not significant. Also given the sample size, and the large number of regions of interest, correlations between the behavioral measures and imaging are deferred until we have a larger cohort with which to explore potential relationships. While the sample size was small, it is likely the largest sample yet reported, and it allows for some insight into the anatomical and pathological correlates of different clinical subtypes of PPAOS. These patients will be followed longitudinally to allow for documentation of how their presentations evolve. Ultimately, autopsy confirmation will reveal the underlying pathology in these patients.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In this study, it is demonstrated that PPAOS has two differing clinical presentations -one predominated by prosodic abnormalities and the other predominated by phonetic (articulatory) disturbances -with converging supportive imaging evidence. The clinical methods developed to quantify these distinctions (ASRS-3 and AES) will permit more reliable and refined diagnosis of PPAOS. The findings support the need for continued study of these differing clinical presentations as it relates to the evolution of the clinical syndrome, including whether there is differential emergence of language, cognitive, or motor difficulties, with subsequent implications for patient counseling and care planning. Ultimately, autopsy data will confirm the distribution and type of pathologies underpinning these different clinical presentations and determine the degree to which PPAOS subtypes predict underlying pathology.

A cohort of 112 participants normal control group (NC, 62 cases), mild cognitive impairment group (MCI, 31 cases) and AD group (19 cases), was recruited in our study. The brain networks of rsfMRI functional connectivity (rsfMRI-FC) and diffusion tensor imaging structural connectivity (DTI-SC) across the three groups were constructed, and their correlations were evaluated by Pearsons correlation analyses and multiple comparison with Bonferroni correction.

The results demonstrated that there existed significant correlation between rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC (p  0.05), and the coupling of rsfMRI-FCDTI-SC showed negative correlation with MMSE score (p  0.05), positive correlations with CDR-SB and FAQ scores (p  0.05), and no correlation with MoCA score (p  0.05). It was concluded that there existed FCSC coupling and varied network characteristics for rsfMRI and DTI, and this would provide the clues to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits of AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is one kind of neurodegenerative disease, which is clinically accompanied by typical progressive cognitive decline and behavioral impairments. It not only affects the daily life of patients but also brings a heavy burden on families, public healthcare systems and society. The AD affected more than 15 of people aged 65 years and older and its annual healthcare cost had reached more than  300 billion worldwide 1.\nAlzheimers changes typically begin in the human brain with the slow accumulation of abnormal structures, namely plaques and tangles, which was suspected to be the prime contributor to the damage and death of nerve cells in the human brain. The plaques in extracellular β-amyloid protein and tangles in intracellular twisted fibers of tau protein somehow played an important role in blocking the communication among nerve cells and disrupting processes needed for cell survival 2. Previous studies confirmed that these pathological changes started decades ago before the first signs of memory loss 3.\nBesides the structural MRI, the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) had been proposed to evaluate the brain morphological and functional changes. Recently, the DTI and rsfMRI brain networks based on graph theory had been applied in the AD studies. According to the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC), the human brain was assumed as one assembly of highly interconnected networks or connectomes. The brain networks of SC were reconstructed by abundant cortical-cortical and subcortical WM axonal pathways, while the brain FC networks in vivo mapped the statistical connections between the cortical nodes in the complex neural systems, i.e., functional connectome 4,5. The graph-based network analyses promised to reliably quantify brain SC and FC with a cluster of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable brain network measures. Therefore, the relevant studies revealed that the capability of information transmission across brain networks could be assessed by common network characteristics of path length (Lp), clustering coefficient (Cp), global efficiency (Eg), local efficiency (El) and small-worldness (σ) 678.\nDTI-SC networks demonstrated unique values in the evaluation of AD 9. The global DTI-SC demonstrated that there were increased Lp and reduced Eg for AD 10. Moreover, the DTI-SC within the intra-occipital lobe gradually became weakened during the progression of AD 11. Another study found that the hemispheric asymmetry of brain networks could be taken as a potential biomarker for AD 12. Again, WM seeded networks had approximately more than 400 connections and presented stronger connections than GM seeded networks for both AD and control groups 13. Accordingly, the network of rsfMRI-FC showed specific characteristics of random network topology with powerless connections at anterior, posterior, and prefrontal brain regions. Nevertheless, the FC at the occipital and frontal lobes did not change with significant large-scale SC alterations during the transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD 1415161718. Related studies verified that the cognitive and memory impairments were strongly correlated with the decreased σ, increased Lp and Cp for AD 19.\nTill now, the analysis of FC-SC coupling based on the graph theory has become a hot spot of brain studies. Since the default mode network (DMN) had been highlighted as a large-scale network of brain regions that were highly correlated with each other in terms of neural activity and the changes within this network had been described in healthy aging as well as in AD 20. It was proved that the core regions of the DMN were associated with brain regions having memory function 21. At the mode of DMN, the coupling strength between DTI-SC and rsfMRI-FC was significantly correlated, and the comparison of brain FC and SC networks for healthy participants indicated that pairs of nodes had stronger SCs and FCs 22. The decreased coupling of FC-SC might indicate more stringent and less dynamic brain function for AD 23. The coupling between rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC was obviously increased for the connections of DMN in AD 24. It was evident that the correlations between FC and SC could provide more comprehensive and sensitive biomarkers, and helped to reveal the variations of network connectivity and functional interactivity of AD 25,26.\nIn our study, an optimized scheme for brain network coupling was proposed with the aim to investigate the coupling correlation between DTI-SC and rsfMRI-FC. Via the measured brain network characteristics, the coupling of rsfMRI-FCDTI-SC was evaluated by Pearsons correlation analyses and multiple comparison with Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, the correlations between the rsfMRI-FCDTI-SC coupling and four neuropsychological scores, including mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), were inferred by partial correlation analyses, respectively. This study would provide new insights to explore the changes in FC-SC coupling during AD progression.",

Firstly, the brain MR images were parcellated into 90 cerebral regions by the atlas of anatomical automatic labeling (AAL) from montreal neurological institute (MNI) 30. Secondly, the nodes and edges of the rsfMRI-FC network were defined by extracting the time series of the 90 cerebral regions and the normalized correlation matrix with Fisher Z-transformation was constructed by Pearsons correlation coefficients 31. Similarly, the nodes and edges of the DTI-SC network were defined as mentioned above. The T1WI images registered to the original B0 image were mapped to the MNI space by nonlinear transformation. Then, the AAL template was inverted from the MNI space to the original DTI space with the implementation of nearest neighbor interpolation. Here, the product of fractional anisotropy (FA) matrix and fiber number (FN) matrix was used to define the nodes and edges. To reduce the effect of pseudo-junctions during whole-brain fiber tracking, only the nodes connected with fiber bundles (edges) having more than three fibers were regarded as effective connections. Thirdly, the non-directional and weighted brain networks were delineated by defined nodes and edges.",

The chi-square tests were used for the gender variable, and the variance analyses were used for other variables. Secondly, the brain network characteristics of rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC were also compared. The network characteristics of rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC were evaluated by variance analyses. If the results were significantly different between two groups, the Bonferroni tests would be further used to evaluate the differences. Thirdly, the coupling strength between rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC were evaluated by Pearsons correlation analyses and multiple comparison with Bonferroni correction. Especially, the area under the curves (AUC) derived from receiving operating characteristic curves were used for the intergroup comparison of rsfMRI-FCs because of the sensitivity for detecting topological differences in brain FC networks 34.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, the network coupling of FC-SC based on graph theory was evaluated via the three aspects of network characteristics, coupling analysis and correlations with the neuropsychological scores. The results showed that the coupling strength varied across three groups and this network coupling was proved to be correlated with neuropsychological scores in different trends.\nAccording to the graph theory of regular and random networks, any small-world networks could facilitate the efficiency of information transmission and processing at lower processing cost and capacity consumption 35. The inconsistency change of Cp among groups may be related to the differences in sample size, network node and threshold selection. During the AD progression, increased Lp and decreased Eg suggested that the information transmission rate and integration capacity were obviously reduced, and this would in turn lead to the observed impairments in cognitive and executive functions 36. Indeed, the structural core of the brain played a great role in integrating information across functionally segregated brain regions 37,38. The changes of the damaged FC and SC networks provided not only the critical imaging markers but also the potential clues to understand the underlying mechanism of cognitive deficits of AD 39.\nFor the rsfMRI-FC, the NC had larger σ and smaller Lp, while the AD had larger Lp. It was consistent with the previous neuroscientific findings 19. In addition, the efficiency of the rsfMRI-FC decreased along with the smaller Eg in AD. It was indicated that the topology of damaged brain FC would certainly lead to the decrease of global network processing efficiency in AD 10. Similarly for the DTI-SC network, there were no significant difference for the σ among the three groups. It was hinted that the human brain might maintain the optimal network topology to achieve the most efficient information transmission for the most efficient information transmission during progressive neurodegeneration. While the increased Lp and decreased Eg reflected the impairment of global connectivity of DTI-SC in AD 36.\nWith the coupling analysis, there were significant correlations for rsfMRI-FCDTI-SC. The correlations between FC-SC coupling and neuropsychological scores (MMSE, CDR-SB, FAQ and MoCA) provided further support for the assumption that these changes in network coupling contributed to the cognitive decline in AD. It was reported that the coupling strength of rsfMRI-FCDTI-SC was increased with the known greater severity of cognitive deficits in AD 40,41. It might be explained by the reasons that the loss of plasticity within pathways connecting different brain regions (nodes) for constrained brain network dynamics 42. The integrity of SC might reflect the ability of the cerebral cortex to maintain functional diversity and neural activity interactions 43. Therefore, the increased coupling indicated that AD would produce more direct functional interactions related to anatomical connections, which implied that brain function became more rigid, less dynamic and adaptable. Moreover, it reduced the restructuring capacity of functional network and mitigated the effects of brain regional degeneration 44,45.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the gender effect of participants was not considered due to the limited sample size. Second, DTI-SC was certainly underestimated for the missed information of crossover fibers during DFT. More accurate SC would be achieved by the betterment of fiber tracking algorithms on higher resolution data sets. Finally, multiple modalities of brain networks should be involved for convincing results, such as the metabolism connectivity of positron emission tomography (PET) and FC of electroencephalography. It would be of further interest to investigate disease-related changes in these dynamic properties and their relationship to cognitive decline on more larger data samples.",

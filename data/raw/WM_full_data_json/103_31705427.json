    "abstract": "Morphologic evolution of recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSI) ranges from lesion disappearance to lacune formation and the reasons for this variability are still poorly understood. We hypothesized that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and blood-brainbarrier (BBB) abnormalities early on can predict tissue damage 1 year after an RSSI. We studied prospectively recruited patients with a symptomatic MRI-defined RSSI who underwent baseline and two pre-specified MRI examinations at 1-3-month and 1year post-stroke. We defined the extent of long-term tissue destruction, termed cavitation index, as the ratio of the 1-year T1weighted cavity volume to the baseline RSSI volume on FLAIR. We calculated fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) of the RSSI and normal-appearing white matter, and BBB leakage in different tissues on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Amongst 60 patients, at 1-year post-stroke, 44 patients showed some degree of RSSI cavitation on FLAIR, increasing to 50 on T2-and 56 on T1-weighted high-resolution scans, with a median cavitation index of 7 (range, 1-36). Demographic, clinical, and cerebral small vessel disease features were not associated with the cavitation index. While lower baseline MD of the RSSI (r s  -0.371; p  0.004) and more contrast leakage into CSF (r s  0.347; p  0.007) were associated with the cavitation index in univariable analysis, only BBB leakage in CSF remained independently associated with cavitation (beta  0.315, p  0.046). Increased BBB leakage into CSF may indicate worse endothelial dysfunction and increased risk of tissue destruction post RSSI. Although cavitation was common, it only affected a small proportion of the original RSSI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSIs) are the neuroimaging correlate of acute lacunar strokes, which make up to 25 of all ischemic strokes 1,2. RSSIs have different morphological fates. Besides the classical evolution to a lacunar cavity, they can also turn to a more unspecific lesion (i.e., a noncavitated hyperintensity on T2-or FLAIR-weighted MRI scans) and some vanish after several weeks or months 34567. Prior studies have mostly considered FLAIR-andor T2weighted MRI sequences to rate the final tissue outcome of an RSSI. However, isotropic, high-resolution T1 sequences increase the sensitivity of detecting small lacunar lesions following an RSSI, yielding some degree of cavitation in  90 3,5.\nThe causes and mechanisms that determine the morphologic evolution of an RSSI are incompletely understood. Factors leading to more or less tissue destruction would not only be relevant regarding a more refined understanding of the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https:doi.org10.1007s12975-019-00741-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) but could also be clinically relevant (e.g., enhance understanding of the risk of cognitive impairment), since cavitation is likely to indicate worse tissue destruction than with non-cavitated or vanishing lesions, and apply to symptomatic and to asymptomatic acute small subcortical lesions 8 that contribute to accumulating brain damage.\nFew studies have assessed the capacity of advanced MRI techniques to predict tissue destruction following an RSSI. A promising candidate is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by indicating the initial severity of ischemia and of microstructural (dis)integrity 9. Another candidate is dynamic contrastenhanced (DCE) MRI as increased general blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage in subcortical tissues and into CSF has been seen in patients with more severe microvascular brain changes 10,11, and could also be associated with increased focal morphological damage following an RSSI.\nWe hypothesized that (1) more severe DTI abnormalities of the RSSI at baseline and (2) greater BBB leakage 1-3-month post-stroke on DCE MRI would be associated with more severe focal tissue destruction 1 year after an RSSI. We used a high-resolution T1 sequence to increase the sensitivity for detecting cavity formation and quantified the amount of total tissue destruction as the ratio of the T1 cavity volume at year 1 and the FLAIR infarct volume at baseline, which we termed the cavitation index.",

Further clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of the study cohort are shown in Table 1.\nAt 1-year post-stroke, 44 patients (73) showed some evidence of cavitation on FLAIR-weighted MRI scans. This number increased to 50 (83) when additionally considering T2-weighted scans. On high-resolution isotropic T1 scans, 56 (93) patients had some cavitation of the index RSSI (Fig. 1).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, nearly all patients with a symptomatic RSSI had some degree of cavity formation (median amount was 7, ranging up to 36 of the original RSSI volume) on highresolution, isotropic T1 MRI sequences 1 year after the index stroke event. To rate the amount of tissue destruction, we propose the RSSI cavitation index as a quantitative tissue outcome parameter, which we defined as the ratio of T1 cavity Fig. 3 Calculation of the RSSI cavitation index. The index RSSI in the thalamus is segmented on FLAIR scans at baseline (outlined in red). The green mask illustrates the contralateral control region (image A). Image B shows the evolution of the RSSI at 1-year follow-up as a cavity on T1.\nThe cavity was again segmented (displayed in red). The cavitation index is calculated as the ratio between the volume of the T1 cavity at 1 year and the FLAIR volume of the RSSI at baseline ( 27 in this case) volume at 1-year post-stroke in relation to the RSSI volume on FLAIR-weighted scans at baseline. While lower MD levels of the RSSI at baseline MRI (indicating worse initial ischemia) and BBB leakage in the CSF at 1-3-month post-stroke correlated with a higher cavitation index, only the latter remained independently associated with the cavitation index in multivariable analyses.\nDetermining predictors for cavitation and the degree of tissue destruction following an RSSI is important for several reasons. These include identifying possible differences in tissue vulnerability and repair and a possible underestimation of brain tissue loss from previous RSSIs on cross-sectional imaging. Most importantly, the cavity formation after an RSSI is likely of clinical importance since the volume and number of lacunes are associated with cognitive decline in patients with CSVD 25. In the present study, severity of cavitation had no effect on functional neurological or general cognitive outcome at 1-year post-stroke, but notably our sample was likely not large enough to comprehensively assess such associations.\nIn line with most previous studies, we did not find any associations between baseline demographic, clinical, or conventional MRI features of CSVD with subsequent cavitation 3,567. In contrast, another study from our center on a different cohort using CT or MRI to detect cavitation found deep brain atrophy was with cavitation, and diabetes and hypertension were more frequent in patients with noncavitating lesions 4. The present study suggests that the severity of cavitation is related to the degree of ischemia in the acute phase of the infarct since lower MD values of the RSSI (corrected for contralateral control region) correlated with a higher cavitation index. This finding agrees with a rodent stroke model and a previous study in patients with territorial ischemia 26,27. Likewise, a lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the RSSI has been associated with subsequent RSSI cavitation (versus no cavitation) in another cohort of patients with lacunar infarction 3. However, in the present study, the MD value of the RSSI was no longer predictive of cavitation severity after multivariable analysis. This is again consistent with the already mentioned study 3 and another investigation 28 using the ADC to estimate the initial degree of ischemiaboth reports also showed that ADC levels of acute stroke lesions did not predict subsequent tissue outcome after adjustment for covariates. Moreover, we found no correlation of lesional FA values with cavitation. This agrees with previous work showing that FA is less predictive of acute stroke tissue fate 29 and could be explained by rather heterogeneous FA patterns in acute cerebral ischemia 30.\nMost interestingly, we found that CSF BBB leakage at 1-3month follow-up after stroke correlated with the cavitation index independently. While the present study was small, this finding supports the role of diffuse widespread endothelial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of CSVD 31. In longitudinal studies, BBB leakage predicted recurrent stroke, more accumulating CSVD changes (progression of WMH), and cognitive decline in patients with lacunar stroke 11,13. Subtle BBB disruption could increase leakage of fibrinogen, which is toxic in interstitial tissues, increasing perivascular inflammationimmune activation and inducing neurodegeneration and progressive CSVD-related brain damage 13,32. The finding of increased levels of the neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) in the serum of RSSI patients with subsequent lesion cavitation could support this assumption 3. While such an increase most likely comes from more extensive neuroaxonal damage 33, a leaky BBB could also facilitate the release of NfL into the blood. However, we also have to note BBB leakage in other cerebral tissues was not with cavitation. This could potentially also be explained by the applied method, which might not be sensitive enough to detect more subtle BBB leakage in different parenchymal brain tissues.\nIn previous neuroimaging studies, there is heterogeneity regarding the morphological evolution of an RSSI. Depending on the (1) definition of a lacunecavity, (2) applied neuroimaging modalities (CT or MRI) and MRI sequences, and (3) considered follow-up time periods, the rate of cavitation has been reported within a wide range between 48 and 94 34567. Our study is in line with two previous reports showing that the incorporation of high-resolution T1 sequences significantly increases the sensitivity of detecting (often small) RSSI cavitation 3,5. While evidence for lacunar cavitation was present in nearly three-fourths on FLAIR and 85 on T2, almost all patients (93) had a visible cavity on high-resolution T1, a number, which corresponds well with the study from Moreau and colleagues reporting cavitation on T1 sequences in 94 of patients at 90 days after the index infarct 5. When we used co-registration and lesion magnification and neglected the widely used minimal lacunar diameter of 3 mm 2, we noticed that all patients had at least a small T1 hypointense lesion at 1-year follow-up MRI. Hence, the cavitation index was introduced to quantify the amount of complete tissue destruction. Previous studies only considered any cavitation versus non-cavitation but not the actual amount of tissue damage. Besides statistical advantages, our approach offers the possibility of quantifying the degree of cavitation in relation to the index stroke lesion. The cavitation index is similar to the black hole ratio used in multiple sclerosis to assess rates of tissue destruction and ongoing disease activity 23,34,35. Our study also benefitted from the prospective recruitment of consecutive stroke patients, a thorough clinical workup and uniform, pre-specified MRI protocols at given time points on the same scanner.\nWe also have to consider several limitations. First, sample size was moderate, which potentially also limits the explanatory power of multivariable analyses. On the other hand, this is the largest study that has analyzed tissue outcome on RSSI in detail. Although MRI ratings have been performed without knowledge of clinical data and most MRI features were available from prior analyses, RSSI fate was rated by one single rater. However, inter-rater reliability measurements between two observers with different experiences and different methods revealed consistent results regarding cavitation volume-the main tissue outcome parameter of this study. Of note, T1 lesions were often small and therefore difficult to distinguish from enlarged perivascular spaces. However, while it is possible that some cavities represent residua of a perivascular space, we took particular care to avoid such misclassification with reference to baseline images. Moreover, exclusion of the four patients without an obvious T1 cavity did not significantly change the overall results. Irrespective of that, most of the RSSI tissue does not develop actual cavitation on T1 but remains hyperintense (or regains normal signal) on FLAIR and T2 sequences 36. In future analyses, we will analyze DTI and BBB parameters in RSSI subregions that do or do not cavitate-an approach, which may help to understand the pathological processes in CSVD, tissue vulnerability, and repair. Finally, future studies should also examine in detail the clinical and especially cognitive domain-specific (long-term) consequences of more severe tissue destruction after an RSSI in larger cohorts.",

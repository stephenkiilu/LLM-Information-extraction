    "abstract": "Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could detect abnormal brain microstructural alterations. DTI studies of Huntingtons Disease(HD) have yielded inconsistent results. Objective: To integrate the existing DTI studies of HD and explore the validity of DTI to detect microstructural damages in HD brain via meta-analysis. Methods: Systematic and comprehensive searches of the databases were performed for DTI studies of HD. The data from the studies that met our inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed using the CMA2 software. Random effect models were utilized to minimize the potential between-study heterogeneity. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The meta-analysis included 140 pre-symptomatic HD (PreHD), 235 symptomatic HD (SymHD) patients and 302 controls, revealing significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, while decreased FA in the corpus callosum of both PreHD and SymHD patients compared with controls. In addition, significantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) was identified in the putamen and thalamus of both PreHD and SymHD patients, and in the caudate of SymHD patients, while no significant difference in MD in the caudate of PreHD patients. In the corpus callosum, there was a significant increase of radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity in SymHD patients compared with controls. Meta-regression showed gender-based difference in MD values of the caudate. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis provides further evidence that DTI detects microstructural damage of both white matter and gray matter even in PreHD gene carriers. MD is less sensitive than FA in detecting structural changes in PreHD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant hereditary neurologic disease, caused by the abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the IT15 gene on chromosome 4 1. A number of expanded CAG repeats more than 36 can lead to neuronal death and brain atrophy, especially in the striatum 2. The major clinical presentations of HD include motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorder 3.\nThe main pathology of HD is loss of medium spiny neurons, which are projection neurons, in the striatum. Loss of these projection neurons might cause white matter abnormality or microstructural alterations in the striatum. DWI or DTI could describe microstructural changes, which might precede macrostructural changes such as brain volume atrophy measured by voxel-based morphometry. Even though other imaging techniques are available, they have some limitations. For instance, functional MRI is dependent on the blood oxygenation level, which could only detect brain activity alterations instead of anatomical structural abnormality. PET studies were limited due to safety concerns about radiation exposure. DTI studies on HD have demonstrated that cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of HD patients are associated with disrupted structural striatal connections such as cortio-striatal circuits 4,5. Through measuring diffusion parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), DTI could quantify the orientation and integrity of white matter (WM) tracts as well as offering insights into the microstructure of gray matter (GM) 6. It is generally accepted that FA represents fiber coherence or directionality of the microstructure. FA is considered to be decreased with loss of tissue organization or cellular integrity, with a value of 0 suggesting equal diffusion in all directions whereas 1 suggesting unidirectional linear diffusion. MD estimates the average of the three principal directional diffusivities, with high MD value indicating unrestricted diffusion and low MD value indicating restricted diffusion 7. RD and AD measure the rate of diffusion perpendicular and parallel to the main direction of diffusion, respectively. Increases in RD reflect the demyelination of WM tracts, while increases in AD represent axonal degeneration and loss 8.\nIn the field of DTI studies of HD, the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus (GP) and corpus callosum (CC) have been repeatedly investigated. However, they yielded inconsistent results possibly due to small sample size of each study. For instance, some studies reported increased FA in both caudate and putamen 9,10, while other studies reported significant FA changes only in the putamen, not in the caudate 11,12. One study reported no significant difference in FA in the GP 13, while another reported significantly increased FA in the GP in HD 14. Increased FA indicates increased integrity of the tissue. The mechanism underlying this remains unknown. A study on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder reported increased FA in the striatum as well and implicated that it might be caused by anomalous WM development 15. Currently, there are several interpretations of increased FA in the striatum in HD. One of them suggested that it correlated with preferential loss of the striatal connections, transforming the striatum into a more organized structure, as supported by Douaud et al. 9. Another one suggested that it could result from pathologic processes that modify tissue integrity, such as neuronal remodeling and loss, secondary astrocytosis, or changes in cell permeability 11. And a recent study implied that the increased FA observed in the GP of HD was likely due to an increased amount of metalloprotein-bound iron 13.\nTo figure out whether there are microstructural alterations measured by DTI parameters in HD brain, especially in the striatum, and to find out the most suitable parameter to detect the alterations, we carried out a systematic review of the literature of DTI studies on HD patients and conducted a meta-analysis using a similar processing method utilized by a published study on mild traumatic brain injury 16.",

      "text": "Generally, there are two different approaches studying DTI parameters from DTI data. The first approach is called voxel-wise whole brain analysis (WBA), including voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), which only provide the coordinates of the brain areas that show significantly difference in FA in patients compared to HCs. The other one is region of interest (ROI) analysis, including that used tractography for the definition of ROI 17. This approach preselects brain structures to be studied based on a prior theory and reports values of the selected ROIs.\nOur systematic search yielded seven studies using TBSS approach and four studies using VBA approach. Two of the seven TBSS studies are longitudinal, and four of them did not report coordinates. We emailed the authors, but they were not able offer the information. The four VBA studies used completely different thresholds, which is not suitable to conduct a meta-analysis. Thus, we will only conduct a meta-analysis of the ROI studies in the current work.",

We excluded papers that (1) included HD patients with other neurological disorders besides HD, (2) whose data were entered twice from a study population that had been analyzed in more than one publication. Brain regions were included if there were two or more studies reporting more than two datasets with sufficient data in total.

In studies that reported two patient groups (PreHD and SymHD group), the weighted average effect size was also calculated and defined as the mean effect size of an additional combined HD group.\nRandom effect models were utilized for all the meta-analyses to minimize the potential between-study heterogeneity resulted from factors including variation in location of ROI, different methods used to define ROI, number of excitation and b factor.

However, the results of these tests were not separately reported, because this method is known to be unreliable when there are fewer than 10 studies in the meta-analysis. Trying to reduce the heterogeneity, we performed the meta-analysis by excluding the datasets of which SMD values were far away from that of the majority of the studies via visually checking the forest plot(Supplementary Fig. 1). This resulted some changes in the SMD values without altering the significance of the results. Further more, the between-study heterogeneity could be explained by methodological differences including different methods used to define ROI, different softwares used to process imaging data, different MRI scanners used to obtain data.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of DTI studies of HD. We demonstrated significantly increased FA in the caudate, putamen, and GP, while decreased FA in the CC of both PreHD and SymHD patients compared with controls, with SMD of the SymHD group higher than that of the PreHD group. In addition, our meta-analysis identified significantly increased MD in the putamen and thalamus of both PreHD and SymHD patients, and in the caudate of SymHD patients. In the CC, there was a significant increase of RD and AD in SymHD patients compared with controls. The robustness of our results was verified by one-way sensitivity analyses.\nThe significant increase of FA in the striatum in both PreHD and SymHD patients demonstrated by our meta-analysis suggests that FA could detect abnormal microstructural alterations in the striatum even before motor onset in HD gene carriers. The best supported interpretation of the increased FA in the striatum is the one by Douaud et al., who hypothesized that selective loss of striatalpallidal projections might be the cause of a more organized striatum 9. They revealed significant decreased dispersion in the head and body of the caudate, the anterior putamen and the globus pallidus in HD subjects. Further more, they revealed a significant reduction in the jxj component of the principal diffusion direction in the patients, and a significant increase in the jyj and jzj components of fiber orientation, by using whole-brain voxel-wise analysis, confirming selective degeneration of striatal connections, which corresponds to increased FA in the striatum. An earlier study suggested that FA could be a particular sensitive marker for assessing brain microstructural changes in PreHD individuals far from onset 25. However, we could not find the difference in FA between PreHD and SymHD groups (Supplementary Information). Thus our meta-analysis could not determine whether FA is a sensitive biomarker of HD progression.\nOur meta-analysis did not show significant difference in MD in the caudate of PreHD group and in the GP of both PreHD and SymHD groups, suggesting that MD is less sensitive than FA in detecting pre-symptomatic changes of diffusivity in the striatum. The absence of significant MD changes in the GP in patient groups could be due to iron deposition within this nucleus, which would consequently reduce the extracellular space, as suggested by Sanchez-Castaneda et al. 14.\nBoth PreHD and SymHD groups showed significant increased MD in the thalamus, without difference in FA values. Thalamus is part of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. Microstructural alteration in the thalamus was most likely related to primary striatal injury 9. Consistent with all the included studies, our meta-analysis revealed decreased FA in CC in both PreHD and SymHD groups compared with controls. Increased MD, RD and AD was identified in the CC of SymHD patients, which means there are demyelination as well as axonal degeneration in the CC of SymHD patients. In PreHD patients, RD was marginally increased, while AD and MD did not show any significant increase. An increase in RD with no change in AD has been documented in a very specific type of myelin pathology called dysmyelination 26. Contrary to demyelination, dysmyelination is the incomplete myelination of axons 27. However, it is unable to confirm whether the increased RD is a result of dysmyelination or demyelination or both in PreHD patients included in our meta-analysis without histological data. The CC is mainly made up of fibers that arise from large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V that give rise to long-reaching intra-cortical projections, instead of fibers that arise from cortico-striatal neurons. Thus, the abnormal diffusion parameters in the CC suggest that cortical degeneration is not dependent on the degeneration of striatal neurons 21.\nThe meta-regression analysis demonstrated that female percentage of the total HD subjects correlated the mean MD values in the caudate (p ¼ 0.007, R ¼ À0.83), suggesting increased mean MD values with lower female percentage of the total subjects. This indicates that MD values of the caudate in males are higher than that of female HD subjects. The reason for this is unknown. Previous studies reported that atrophy rate of the caudate was greater in males than in females 28, which might lead to more neuronal loss and higher diffusivity in the caudate of males compared with females, thus causing higher MD values of the caudate in males. Another possible reason might be longer CAG repeat length in males, which causes more structural damage compared with females in HD subjects. However, it is beyond the ability of this metaanalysis to verify this reason due to unattainability of original data. This finding suggests future DTI studies should pay more attention to sex-based difference. The relation between DTI parameters and other clinical measures was unclear due to the small number of studies.",

Second, the between-study heterogeneity was inevitable due to methodological differences of the included studies including different methods used to define ROI, different softwares used to process imaging data, different MRI scanners used to obtain data. Never the less, the sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. Lastly, we cannot deny the possible existence of the data we could not find.",

We identified significantly increased FA in the caudate, putamen, and GP of both PreHD and SymHD patients, while no significant difference in MD in the caudate and GP of PreHD patients, suggesting MD is less sensitive than FA in detecting pre-symptomatic changes of diffusivity in the striatum. Increased FA is most likely caused by selective degeneration of the striatum. In the CC, we identified demyelination as well as axonal degeneration in SymHD patients. The meta-regression also demonstrates that there is gender-related difference in MD values of the caudate. More studies are needed to clarify association between DTI measures and clinical features.",

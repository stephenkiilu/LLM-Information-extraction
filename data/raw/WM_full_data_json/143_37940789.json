    "abstract": "Sleep disturbance is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), but the underlying micro-pathological evidence remains limited. To bridge this gap, we established an amyloid-β oligomers (AβO)induced rat model of AD and subjected it to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess white matter (WM) integrity and ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths. Our findings demonstrated that SD exacerbated AβO-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we found SD aggravated AβO-induced asymmetrical impairments in WM, presenting with reductions in tract integrity observed in commissural fibers and association fasciculi, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths within the hippocampus and corpus callosum further confirmed a lateralized effect. Moreover, SD worsened AβO-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, with impairments in critical nodes of the left hemisphere strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. This work represents the first identification of a lateralized impact of SD on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in an AD rat model. These findings could deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep disturbance and AD pathology, providing valuable insights into the early progression of the disease, as well as the development of neuroimaging biomarkers for screening early AD patients with self-reported sleep disturbances. Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and memory decline. The early impairment of cognition and memory in AD is widely attributed to synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction induced by soluble amyloid-β oligomers (AβO) 1. Although AD has traditionally been associated with gray matter pathology, emerging evidence suggests significant damage to the white matter (WM) occurs in the early stages of the disease 234. Longitudinal WM degeneration, particularly involvement of the corpus callosum, cingulum and uncinate fasciculus has been observed in sporadic early AD patients, indicating WM injury precedes the formation of amyloid-β plaque 5,6. The WM, composed of myelinated axon bundles, plays a crucial role in mediating the structural and functional connectivity between different brain regions and facilitates bilateral cerebral cooperation 7,8. On top of that, the cellular architecture of myelin, a glial membrane wrapped spirally around axons, facilitates the conduction of action potentials and allows oligodendrocytes to provide nutritional support to axons 9. Thus, abnormal changes in the WM can contribute to cognitive decline.\nSleep disorder has been identified as a primary risk factor for AD development and is also associated with WM damage 10,11. Myelin is very vulnerable to sleep loss, and chronic sleep restriction can lead to myelin thinning or demyelination, but micro-pathological evidence of sleep disturbance on WM integrity remains scarce 12,13. In primary insomnia patients, it has been demonstrated that an abnormal WM tract presented in the right limbic cortico-basal ganglia circuit, accompanied by lower global efficiencies, indicating a potential lateralized brunt of sleep loss on mesoscopic connectivity 14,15. The existing evidence suggests a close association among WM damage, sleep loss, and the development of AD. However, the precise mechanisms linking WM damage to sleep disorders and AD remain poorly understood.\nOn these bases, we hypothesized that sleep disorder, as an accomplice, could exacerbate the progression of AD through damaging WM. To verify this hypothesis, we established an amyloid-β oligomer (AβO)-induced rat model of AD subjected to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a relatively new magnetic resonance (MR) modality sensitive in detecting WM microstructural alterations 16, we found that SD exacerbated AβO-induced asymmetrical reductions in tract integrity and unilateral damage to specific association fasciculi and commissural fibers, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Furthermore, lateralized ultrastructure changes of discrete myelin sheath within the hippocampus and corpus callosum were also revealed through transmission electron microscope observation. Moreover, SD aggravated AβO-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, and the impairment of topological properties in the critical nodes of the left hemisphere was correlated with cognitive dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that SD exacerbated AβO-induced cognitive decline, which is associated with the lateralized brunt of SD on WM.",

The device was set to move the bar at a speed of 2 circlesminute and alternate the direction of rotation between clockwise and counterclockwise. The bar in the cage had a 30-min rest period after each 30-min rotation from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. To monitor the effects of sleep deprivation, a rat was first placed in this cage for testing. The movement of this rat was recorded to analyze the immobility time during sleep restriction, ensuring that the immobility time of the rat was less than 30 s.

Our previous experiments demonstrated either AβO or sleep deprivation could induce early cognitive deficits in rats 17,19. We hypothesized there was a synergistic effect between sleep deprivation and AβO on cognitive impairment. To further verify this hypothesis, we first established the corresponding animal models. The rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control (Con), sleep deprivation (SD), AβO injection (Aβ), and sleep deprivation plus AβO injection (SA) (n  18 ratsgroup). After habituation, the rats in the SA group and the SD group were sleep-deprived for 7 days. On the fourth day of sleep deprivation, the SA group and the Aβ group rats received intracerebroventricular injections of AβO, which is to simulate an early development of AD 19 under a chronic risk of sleep loss conditions. After 7 days of sleep deprivation, the rats were immediately subjected to behavior tests. Subsequently, MRI multi-parameter scans of the rat brain were performed (Fig. 1a).\nWith NOR testing, we found that, compared to that in the Con group, the discrimination ratio (DR) and times of interaction with the novel object reduced significantly in SD, Aβ, and SA groups (p  0.0001 respectively, vs Con) (Fig. 1b-e). Moreover, compared with the SD and Aβ groups, the SA group showed a further decreased DR and times of touching novel object, indicating severer cognitive decline (p  0.020 and p  0.0001 respectively) (Fig. 1d ande).

      "text": "Although the cerebral gray matter has been recognized as the major site of cognitive function for a long time, the WM is increasingly identified as equally critical for cognition 29. To further explore whether the WM change is involved in sleep deprivation and AβO synergistically aggravated cognitive decline, we next investigated the effects of sleep deprivation and AβO on WM integrity. We first used voxel-wise mapping to detect regional differences in white matter volume between Con and SD, Aβ, and SA groups of rats respectively (Fig. S2). For Aβ and SA groups, there were significant volume differences in the white matter of the hippocampus and thalamus (Table S1-S3), where memory consolidation is formed and transformed into the cortex 30. Furthermore, the microstructural integrity of the WM was assessed via DTI to quantify the diffusion properties of tracts in multiple directions. The technique of DTI-based tractography permits the virtual reconstruction of WM fiber bundles. Fractional anisotropy (FA) has proved to be useful in the characterization of microstructural damage of WM 31. We chose the hippocampus (HIP) and mPFC, two crucial areas in cognition as regions of interest (ROIs), to exert tractography measurement and assess the number of the white matter tracts and FA value (Fig. 2a ande). Compared with Con, SA group showed a significantly reduced number of tracts in the bilateral hippocampus (p  0.016 for left and p  0.0005 for right, vs Con) (Fig. 2b andc) and left side mPFC (p  0.036 vs Con) (Fig. 2f andg). Compared with the SD group, a severely decreased number of tracts was witnessed in the right hippocampus of the SA group (p  0.030 vs SD) (Fig. 2c). Significant bilateral differences in tracts number in mPFC were also found in SD and SA groups (p  0.0057 for SD and p  0.045 for SA) (Fig. 2g and Fig. S3e andf).\nOn top of that, compared with Con, the SA group showed lower FA values in the white matter tracts of the bilateral hippocampus (p  0.0051 for left and p  0.037 for right respectively, vs Con) (Fig. 2d), as well as a lateralized decrease of FA in right mPFC (p  0.026, vs Con; p  0.026, paired t test) (Fig. 2h and Fig. S3g andh). In fact, in the SD group, the significantly decreased mean FA values in the tracts of mPFC were predominantly observed on the right side (p  0.0047 and p  0.0031 respectively, paired t test), which were largely consistent with the unilateral alternation of FA in mPFC in SA group (Fig. 2h and Fig. S3g andh).\nThe above results suggested that sleep deprivation aggravates AβO-induced destruction of white matter integrity and more severe detrimental effects witnessed on right hippocampal tracts.",

      "text": "To further validate the effects of sleep deprivation and AβO on WM tracts, using transmission electron microscopy, we observed ultrastructural changes of myelin sheaths in the hippocampus and corpus callosum. A discrete state of myelin lamina and the formation of myelin bulbs were found in the hippocampus of SD, Aβ and SA groups (Fig. 4a). For quantification of demyelination, the ratio between axon and fiber (axon  myelin) diameters, the so-called G-ratio, was calculated (Fig. 4b). G-ratio is relatively constant, with a value of approximately 0.6, and the fibers with similar diameters have discrete states of myelin lamina, with lower G-ratios 33. The scatter diagram was shown in Fig. 4c. Compared with the Con group, in the SA group, G-ratio of the right hippocampal myelinated fibers was significantly decreased (p  0.0089, vs Con), and there was significant bilateral difference (p  0.029, independent sample t test) (Fig. 4d). On top of that, the right hippocampal myelin sheath presented a further reduction of G-ratio compared with SD group (p  0.038, vs SD) (Fig. 4d). Besides that, to verify G-ratio, the axon area ratio (axonal area fibral (axon  myelin) area) was calculated. A lower axon area ratio indicates the discrete myelin lamina and myelin bulb formation. A similar change and bilateral difference were also seen in the axon area ratio in the SA group (p  0.0093, vs Con; p  0.0011, vs SD; p  0.0009 for bilateral difference, independent sample t test) (Fig. 4e). In addition, compared with Con group, a significantly reduced axon area ratio was witnessed in the right hippocampal myelin sheath of Aβ group (p  0.038 for axon area ratio, vs Con) (Fig. 4e).\nFor corpus callosum (CC), compared with Con group, all the other three groups demonstrated fewer numbers of myelinated axons (left, p  0.0048 for SD; p  0.0001 for Aβ; p  0.0001 for SA; right, p  0.0010 for SD; p  0.0001 for Aβ; p  0.0001 for SA) and showed a shrinking area of myelinated axons except SD group (left, p  0.0015 for Aβ; p  0.0001 for SA; right, p  0.0001 for Aβ; p  0.0001 for SA) (Fig. 5a-c).

What is more, compared with the Aβ group, the SA group demonstrated a significant decrease in the number on the right side and a reduced area of myelinated axons on the left side of CC (p  0.0008 for the number of myelinated axons, p  0.0042 for area of myelinated axon, vs Aβ) (Fig. 5b andc). Although no statistical difference, the above results suggest a potential synergistic effect of AβO and sleep loss on demyelination in left CC (p  0.12, two-way ANOVA analysis with Bonferronis post hoc) (Fig. 5c). Compared with Con, SA group showed a significant reduction of G-ratio in bilateral CC (p  0.010 and p  0.013 for left and right respectively, vs Con) (Fig. 5d-f). Whereas, compared with the SD group, the SA group only revealed a server decrease of G-ratio in left CC (p  0.021, vs SD) (Fig. 5f). Besides, in the SA group, a pronounced increased myelin area was seen in the right CC (p  0.0001 vs Con, p  0.0003 vs SD, p  0.042 vs Aβ) (Fig. 5g), indicating a severe discrete state of myelin.\nAdditionally, it has been reported that axonal swellings are prominent features of myelin disorders, which are related to AβO generation 6. Axons seem to be important sites of amyloid secretion, and myelin damage-induced axonal swellings could disrupt axonal transport and enhance BACE1 and APP interactions. Hence, to further explore whether there was potential axonal edema, we measured axonal area. Our results showed that, in the SA group, numerous myelin damage-associated axonal edema was observed (Fig. 5a). Notably, an obvious bilateral difference was revealed in the SA group, which presented a marginal downtrend of axon area in left CC and a significant increase in right CC (p  0.17 for left and p  0.032 for right, vs Con) (Fig. 5h andi). This opposite trend of change in the axon area of bilateral CC inarguably might lead to the diminished difference when ignoring the lateralization effect (Fig. 5j). Increased axon area in right CC suggested there might be an axonal edema, which following membrane system dysfunction when losing protection from normal myelin sheath.\nThe above findings suggested that sleep deprivation exacerbates the damage of AβO to myelin in the hippocampus and corpus callosum, especially that in the right side.",

      "text": "The integrity of association fasciculi and commissural fibers contributes to the connective strength of the brain network. Hence, to functionally explore a mesoscopic effect, structural networks based on cognition-related anatomical nodes and tracts were mapped (Fig. 6a-d and Table S7). Our results showed that, in Aβ group, the structural connectivity of left cerebral hemisphere was damaged (cingulate gyrus-PFC, p  0.0034, hippocampus-entorhinal cortex, p  0.023, vs Con), while the connectivity between bilateral hippocampus or bilateral temporal cortex was significantly increased (bilateral hippocampus, p  0.0027, bilateral temporal cortex, p  0.025, vs Con) (Fig. 6c). In SA group, the structural connectivity between left archeocortex and neocortex was remarkably reduced (PFC-cingulate gyrus, p  0.0001; cingulate gyrus-hippocampus, p  0.0009; entorhinal cortex-hippocampus, p  0.0001, vs Con), while the connectivity between either bilateral PFC or bilateral entorhinal cortex was decreased (bilateral PFC, p  0.0322, bilateral entorhinal cortex, p  0.023, vs Con) (Fig. 6d). More interestingly, the connectivity between hypothalamus and hippocampus in SA group was increased (left, p  0.0095; right, p  0.0063, vs Con) (Fig. 6d). The disrupted network connectivity would affect global topological properties. In SA group, shortest path length (Lp) showed an obvious reduction (p  0.0227, vs Con, p  0.013, vs SD) (Fig. 6i), representing the failure of global information transmission, although global efficiency (Eg) was almost unchanged (Fig. 6e). Likewise, local efficiency (Eloc) and the clustering coefficients (Cp) decreased in SA group (p  0.0001 vs Con, p  0.0020 vs SD, for Eloc; p  0.0006 vs Con, p  0.028 vs SD, p  0.020 vs Aβ, for Cp) (Fig. 6f andh), suggesting a disability in local processing efficiency. The rich club could reflect tight connections within important nodes. In the SA group, a significant decrease of the rich club was revealed (p  0.0039 vs Con, p  0.0080 vs SD) (Fig. 6g). Besides that, the property of the small world network (SMN) reduced remarkably in the SA group (p  0.0071 vs Con) (Fig. 6j), indicating an increased energy cost of communication within the network.\nTo further explore the alterations of nodal properties and effects on the global topological attribute, we analyzed all node efficiency and node shortest paths (Fig. 7a and Table S8-S9), which eventually affect the properties of a small-world network. In the SA group, betweenness centrality in the left hippocampus increased significantly (p  0.0080 vs Con) rather than right hippocampus (p  0.030, paired t test) (Fig. 7b), which indicated sleep deprivation and AβO enhanced the hippocampal relaying effect to the entire network. For node efficiency, a remarkable reduction was witnessed in the left hippocampus of the SA group (p  0.0001 vs other groups) (Fig. 7c). Two-way ANOVA analysis showed a cooperative effect between the two factors of sleep deprivation and AβO (p  0.012, Bonferronis post hoc).

Moreover, in the SA group, the node clustering coefficient of the left hippocampus (HIP), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and entorhinal cortex (ENT) decreased significantly (p  0.0001 vs Con) (Fig. 7e, g andi). Two-way ANOVA analysis of three ROIs revealed that sleep deprivation aggravated AβO-induced node clustering coefficient reduction (p  0.038, p  0.026, p  0.027 respectively, Bonferronis post hoc). Accordingly, the clustering coefficient in these critical nodes demonstrated a strong negative correlation to DR (r 2  0.417, p  0.001; r 2  0.231, p  0.001; r 2  0.238, p  0.004, respectively) (Fig. 7f, h, andj).\nThese results indicated that sleep deprivation aggravated AβO-induced lateralized brain network disruption and node clustering coefficient reduction, e The scatter plot showed the distribution of G-ratio in axons of different diameters in each group. f-j Quantification of G-ratio (f), area of myelin sheath (g), and axon area (h-j) in the corpus callosum.

      "text": "Our present work demonstrates that sleep deprivation aggravated AβO-induced cognitive dysfunction, accompanied by reduced integrity of white matter and asymmetrical demyelination in commissural fibers. The degree of damage to topological properties in the left hemisphere is correlated with cognitive impairment (see Graphical abstract). Our findings provide the first identification of a lateralized impact of sleep deprivation on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in a rat model of AD. For sleep deprivation aggravated AβO-induced cognitive dysfunction, we observed a synergistic effect of AβO and SD during the NOR test, consistent with clinical sleep dysfunction-induced risk of AD development 34. However, cognition dropped in all experimental groups during the OPR test and there was no interaction between AβO-induced neurotoxicity and sleep deprivation witnessed in early memory detection. Considering that NOR needs functional integration of multiple memory systems during overnight memory consolidation, which is involved in the hippocampus and other circuits-related brain regions, our results suggest that AβO and SD cooperated to disrupt mesoscopic connection within critical regions in priority and eventually prevent long-term memory forming 20,35.\nOur findings also suggest that sleep deprivation could directly induce WM damage and cause progressive destruction of myelin sheath, which could enhance AβO-induced neurotoxicity and lead to failure in fine-tuning circuit plasticity and cognitive impairment 36. These results emphasize the detrimental impact of sleep deprivation on white matter integrity and its potential role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the vulnerability of these WM tracts could be explained with the retrogenesis hypothesis 37, in our study, we still specifically investigated whether WM defects exert a mesomeric effect in sleep deprivation-aggravated cognitive decline. Ultrastructural demyelination and secondary axon swelling indicated a direct impact of sleep deprivation, with a supra-additive effect in conjunction with AβO-induced neurotoxicity. The microscopic lesion of WM could be caused by direct damage or Wallerian degeneration 38. Due to potential oxidative stress under sleep disruption, oxygen radical is more likely to injure myelin-related lipid structures and neural axons, triggering the onset of AD 39,40. It has been reported that myelin dysfunction disrupted microglial function and interfered clearance of AβO 6. Besides, insults to myelin are most likely induced by disease-associated oligodendrocytes, synergistically aggravating AβO-induced cognitive decline 41. Additionally, at the mesoscopic level, sleep deprivation-induced WM damage could result in an inefficient and uncoordinated network within the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex, leading to the disruption of memory engram formation and potentiation of AβO-induced cognitive dysfunction 42. On top of that, reduced integrity of WM might disintegrate the limbic cortex network and undermine slow wave sleep architecture, ultimately impairing memory consolidation through mis-coupling with hippocampal sharp ripple waves and cortical delta waves 30,43,44.\nAn intriguing observation in our study is the identification of a lateralization effect in sleep deprivation exacerbated AβO neurotoxicity. Our present findings of lateralized disturbance ranging from asymmetrical reduction in integrity of cingulum and anterior commissure to more severe demyelination in right corpus callosum, are consistent with previous reports of abnormal organization in the right limbic corticobasal ganglia network in primary insomnia patients patipatients 14,15. Our result revealed greater separation of functional synchronization within the bilateral cerebral hemispheres of rats, indicating that unilateral damage to the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and cingulum may characterize the early progression of AD aggravated by sleep deprivation. Recent genetics-connectome research has also revealed reduced structural connectivity within bilateral cerebral hemispheres under the AD risk gene, suggesting worse cooperation within cerebral hemispheres in AD development 45,46. Likewise, sleep deprivation, as a risk factor for AD, could exert more damage to commissure fibers and potentially lead to mesoscopic lateralization of brain networks via asymmetric demyelination of the corpus callosum 47,48. Furthermore, loss of inter-hemisphere connectivity in AD patients also suggests bilateral imbalance was a critical pathological feature in AD development 49. It is important to note that, in our results, compared with weakened inter-hemisphere connectivity in the SA group, the brain network of the Aβ group displayed a strengthened inter-hemisphere link. This result likely indicates the satiable recruitment of more brain regions in both hemispheres for functional compensation under AβO treatment 50,51. By contrast, a broader functional disconnection in SA group implied that severer pathological changes occurred and the compensation mechanism was unable to be sustained, and ultimately would lead to irreversible cognition deficits 50,51.\nIt is evident that humans exhibit dominant hemisphere and lateralized susceptivity, such as accelerating asymmetric thinning of the cerebral cortex during aging 525354. However, the existence of Vol.: (0123456789) lateralization in rodents remains controversial and unclear 55. From an evolutionary perspective, brains have grown to such a size that information sharing and spreading between two hemispheres became necessary, allowing for specialization and functioning independently 56. Lateralization is reckoned as a phylogenetic adaptation to increase the efficiency and capacity of the brain 575859. A relevant study has demonstrated a rightward bias in hippocampusdependent memory storage in rats, indicating a potential lateralization and hemisphere-dependent specialization in rodents 60. Similarly, sleep is a conserved and essential physiological function during evolution 61,62. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that when faced with sleep deprivation, some recovery mechanisms of the brain other than sleep itself also become necessary 63,64. Lateralized compensation has been considered the optimal choice for temporarily restoring brain efficiency in rodents and other mammals. However, when initial lateralized compensation is broken down due to severe damage to unilateral white matter, conflicts in advanced cognitive functions become inevitable, increasing the risk of memory loss 45,65. In our study, severe demyelination in the right hippocampus, right anterior commissure, and right corpus callosum represents a lateralized impact pattern of sleep deprivation. This pattern was associated with significant memory deficits under sleep deprivation and AβO-induced neurotoxicity in rats. These findings suggest that bilateral cerebral decompensation may serve as a crucial pathogenic mechanism underlying the development of early-stage AD induced by sleep deprivation.\nAlthough an in-depth study is needed to explore the mechanism of lateralized damage, mesoscopic lateralization provided a new paradigm for diagnostic importance and accuracy 66. Our data indicate that topological properties of the left node bear the brunt of sleep deprivation exacerbating AβO neurotoxicity and contributing to cognitive decline. With further verification of the relationship between biomarkers and functional and clinical measures, this topological biomarker, combined with non-invasive MRI scanning, could potentially serve as a reliable screening tool for early detection of AD patients accompanied by self-reported sleep disorders 67.\nThere are several limitations to the present study. First, due to the bottleneck of DTI scanning, we could not eliminate the potential effect of axoplasmic transport and interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage 68,69. From the mechanobiology angle, efficient axonal transport machinery changed in early AD and was associated with oligomeric forms of Aβ as well as tauopathies 70. Both interstitial fluid drainage and clearance of neurotoxic waste like AβO were particularly affected by sleep state 71. Plus, white matter injury also impeded ISF drainage furthermore, which together with frustration via sleep deprivation could lead to cognitive deficit 72. In addition, we cannot rule out other possibilities that the demyelination of tracts gave rise to a mesoscopic impact independent of a structural network. It has been reported that the integrity of myelin ensures the clearance of ISF drainage, while reduced myelin integrity may propagate tau and AβO aggregation and eventually undermine structural connectivity and network 737475. Lastly, present results cannot precisely prove accurate causality, while the cellular mechanisms of sleep deprivation worsening neurotoxicity of AβO remain a large gap to bridge.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be phenotypically divided into behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and semantic variant PPA (svPPA). However, the neural underpinnings of this phenotypic heterogeneity remain elusive. METHODS: Cortical morphology, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), and their interrelationships were assessed in subtypes of FTD. Neuroimaging-transcriptional analyses on the regional cortical morphological deviances among subtypes were also performed. RESULTS: Changes in cortical thickness, surface area, gyrification, WMH, and DTI-ALPS were subtype-specific in FTD. The three morphologic indices are related to whole-brain WMH volume and cognitive performance, while cortical thickness is related to DTI-ALPS. Neuroimaging-transcriptional analyses identified key biological pathways linked to the formation andor spread of TDP-43tau pathologies. DISCUSSION: We found subtype-specific changes in cortical morphology, WMH, and glymphatic function in FTD. Our findings have the potential to contribute to the development of personalized predictions and treatment strategies for this disorder.

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including behavioral, lingual, and executive-functional deficits. 1 Based on the dominant clinical manifestations, patients with FTD can be classified into three subtypes: the behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), the nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and the semantic variant PPA (svPPA). 2 Among them, the bvFTD subtype is characterized by apathy, lack of empathy, impulsivity, and executionoriented cognitive dysfunction; the nfvPPA subtype is characterized by linguistic difficulties including hesitant speech, agrammatism, and dysarthria; and the svPPA subtype is characterized by semantic dysfunctions such as impaired object recognition, dyslexia, and difficulty in naming. 1,345 Besides the distinctive clinical presentations, the three FTD subtypes also differ in terms of the severity of functional impairments, 6,7 clinical courses, and prognostic outcomes. 8910 For example, patients with the bvFTD subtype are often associated with more pronounced functional disabilities, faster clinical progression, and shorter survival relative to the other two subtypes, 11,12 suggesting disparate neural substrates among subtypes.\nNeuroimaging studies have revealed divergent gray matter volume (GMV) reductions in the three subtypes, with the bvFTD subtype mainly involving the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, the svPPA subtype mainly involving the anterior temporal lobe, and the nfvPPA subtype mainly involving the inferior frontal and insular regions. 13,14 However, the interpretation of GMV changes assessed using voxelbased morphometry can be difficult because GMV is a mixture of cortical thickness, surface area, andor cortical folding. 15,16 Indeed, the three constituent components of GMV are both phenotypically and genetically independent and likely to be affected by different neuropathologic events. 15 No prior studies have simultaneously characterized the subtype-specific changes in the three morphological features of FTD. Studies as such may provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the clinical heterogeneity of this disorder.\nApart from the GM changes, studies have uncovered divergent white matter (WM) abnormalities in FTD subtypes. 14,17 For example, a recent study reported varying degrees of WM lesions among FTD subtypes, with the bvFTD subtype exhibiting more severe WM hyperintensities (WMH) than other subtypes. 18,19 Meanwhile, FTD patients with GRN gene mutation were prone to have more severe WMH than those without, suggesting a genetic basis for the WM lesions. 20,21 Questions however remain unanswered as to whether and how WM lesions and cortical morphological abnormalities in FTD are spatially and causally related. Considering the essential role of WM in metabolite provision, 22 signal transduction, 6 and neurotrophic support to GM, 23 elucidating the interplay between WM lesions and GM morphological abnormalities may uncover potential mechanistic pathways mediating these endophenotypic abnormalities in FTD.\nRecent studies have found that changes in GM and WM are tightly linked to a disrupted glymphatic system, 24 which plays crucial roles in the removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. 25 In FTD, around half of cases are accompanied by neuronal inclusions of toxic TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP- 43) aggregates, while 36-50 of cases are accompanied by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. 4,26 Neuropathologic abnormalities as such have been linked to glymphatic dysfunction that occurs as a result of AQP4 polarization and vascular defects. 27,28 Moreover, studies also found a significant spatial overlapping between regions with trapped contrast agents along perivascular space and cortical regions with profound proteinopathy in FTD. 29,30 Intriguingly, a recent study demonstrated abnormal glymphatic function in the bvFTD variant using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index. 25 Whether changes in the glymphatic system are subtype-specific and related to GM and WM abnormalities in FTD remain unknown.\nThis study aimed to investigate the subtype-specific changes in cortical morphology, WMH, glymphatic function, and their associations in FTD. We hypothesized that (1) cortical morphological changes, severity of WMH, and glymphatic dysfunctions would be subtype-specific in FTD, with the bvFTD subtype exhibiting the most prominent changes;\n(2) cortical morphological changes would relate to whole-brain WMH",

T1-weighted MRI data were collected using a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the fol- further tessellated and topologically corrected to generate a refined surface representation of the boundary (i.e., the white surface). This surface was used as the initial shape for a deformable model to reconstruct the pial surface. From these cortical surfaces, we can derive the three cortical morphological indices. Specifically, the cortical thickness map was obtained by measuring the distance between the pial and white surfaces; the cortical surface area map was computed by allocating one-third of the area of each triangle to each of its vertices; the LGI map was computed by measuring the ratio of the pial surface area to the outer hull surface area in a vertex-wise fashion across the cerebral cortex. The maps of cortical thickness, surface area, and LGI were resampled onto the fsaverage template in FreeSurfer and then smoothed using Gaussian-kernels with full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM) of 20, 20, and 15 mm, respectively. We chose a lower FWHM for LGI as LGI is an inherently smoothed metric. 32,33 Prior to statistical analysis, all the surfaces used for the calculation of the morphological indices were visually checked. Participants with poor surface reconstruction or LGI calculation error in at least one cortical hemisphere were excluded. The number of excluded participants, along with the specific reason for their exclusion, can be found in supplementary methods.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Capitalizing on the multimodal MRI data of the FTLDNI, this study examined the subtype-specific changes in cortical morphology, WMH, and perivascular glymphatic changes, as well as their interrelation- Compared with HCs, we found distinct topographic patterns of cortical thickness reductions in the three FTD subtypes, which are in good agreement with previous studies. 13,37 Specifically, the nfvPPA subtype showed predominant thickness reductions in the bilateral frontal cortex, an area critical for language production and executive function; 38 the svPPA subtype showed predominant thickness reductions in the bilateral anterior and middle temporal cortex, regions that are fundamental for semantic knowledge, single word comprehension, and memory 394041 ; the bvFTD subtype showed more extensive thickness reductions in the bilateral frontal, temporal and parietal cortices, which involve almost all key hubs of the default mode network and have key roles in cognitive processes such as thinking, self-awareness, executive control, and emotional processing. 42 Using the pooled data of three subtypes, we revealed significant correlations of the global mean cortical thickness with the MMSE and CDR scores, suggesting that the cortical thickness reductions may have contributed to the cognitive impairments in FTD. In parallel, we found a similar pattern of surface area reductions as the thickness reductions in the three subtypes, although the affected cortical regions in general were less widely distributed. These results may indicate a coexistence of both radial and tangential (relative to the cortical surface) pathological changes in the FTD subtypes, with the tangential changes being relatively milder than the radial ones. This study also revealed distinct patterns of LGI reductions in the three subtypes, involving predominantly the posterior cingulate and precentral cortices in the nfvPPA subtype, the bilateral orbitofrontal and inferior frontal cortices in the svPPA subtype, and more widespread LGI reductions of the insula and neighboring areas extending to the bilateral frontal, pre-and post-central and inferior parietal in the bvFTD subtype. Considering that gyrification has been thought to be a surrogate measure of underlying brain connectivity, 43 the observed results of LGI reductions thus may signify varying degrees of brain dysconnectivity in the three subtypes, in keeping with a previous study showing similar patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities as the LGI changes in the three subtypes. 17,18 In addition, we uncovered a negative correlation between LGI and CDR score in FTD, indicating that the gyrification reduction may contribute to the progression of dementia in FTD. Intriguingly, all three subtypes exhibited frontotemporal involvement, as evidenced by changes in the three morphologic indices. This pattern likely suggests that changes in these three morphological indices could represent distinct endophenotypic manifestations of shared neuropathological abnormalities existent in relevant frontotemporal regions of FTD.\nCompared with HCs, we found a higher volume of WMH across the whole brain in the bvFTD subtype but not in the nfvPPA and svPPA subtypes. This finding is in line with previous studies and indicates that the white matter lesions of FTD are subtype-dependent. 17 Given that the bvFTD subtype had a higher CDR score than the other two subtypes, a higher level of white matter lesions in the bvFTD subtype may, to some extent, account for the more severe dementia in this subtype. The significant correlations between whole-brain WMH aggregates) in the brain and has been associated with MMSE scores in neurodegenerative diseases. 28,44 Presumably, the compromised glymphatic function may have contributed to the dementia across the three subtypes. This speculation is partially supported by the results of the lowest DTI-ALPS and the highest CDR score in the bvFTD subtype.\nThe speculation, however, is at odds with our findings of the lowest CDR score (i.e., least severe dementia) but comparable DTI-ALPS in the nfvPPA subtype compared to the bvFTD subtype. This suggests that additional pathological factors, such as WMH (being least severe in the nfvPPA subtype), may have a greater impact on the varying severity of dementia across the three subtypes. In addition, lower DTI-ALPS was associated with lower cortical thickness in patients with FTD. This finding may indicate that the dysfunctional glymphatic system cannot effectively eliminate the continuous accumulation of toxic tau andor TDP-43 protein, which consequently may lead to severe neuronal losses, manifesting macroscopically as cortical thinning in FTD.\nNeuroimaging-transcriptional association analysis on regional cortical morphological deviances among the three subtypes has uncovered essential biological processespathways highly relevant to FTD pathologies. On the one hand, we identified a series of biological processes vital for the formation of TDP-43 andor tau aggregates and their intracellular transport. Specifically, the protein phosphorylation process, as a ubiquitous post-translational modification of TDP-43 and tau, could affect their activity, stability and aggregation propensity, 45 while the protein localization to plasma membrane process may have a role in the cytoplasmic mislocalization and accumulation of the predominately nuclear RNA-binding TDP-43. 46,47 Pathological changes as such can be exacerbated by disrupted cellular homeostasis that arises from a cascade of metabolic and inflammatory events. Indeed, disruptions in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism may elevate the level of reactive oxygen species (i.e., oxidative stress), 48 which likely triggers the MAPK pathway and initiates leukocyte activation involved in immune response process, culminating in a state of neuroinflammation. 49505152 Such a pro-inflammatory environment may further aggravate cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 or tau protein aggregates, which appears to interact with processes such as axonogenesis and actin filament organization, enabling their intracellular transport along axons or cellular cytoskeletal structures. 53,54 On the other hand, we also identified several biological processes that support intercellular communication or facilitate the exchange of biological information, such as vesicle-mediated transport and endocytosis or exocytosis. These processes are crucial for moving macromolecules, such as proteins, from within cells to the extracellular space, and disruptions in these processes might hasten the entry of TDP-43 and tau aggregates into the extracellular environment. 555657 Such detrimental effects could be amplified by the inefficient glymphatic waste clearance, 58 Some limitations should be mentioned for this study. First, the uneven sample sizes of the three patient groups may potentially affect the results of the between-group contrasts. Second, there was a significant imbalance in the sex distribution among the three groups.\nThus, sex was incorporated as a covariate of no interest to alleviate its impact on the inter-group contrasts. Third, given that there was no significant correlation between DTI-ALPS and clinical scores in these patients, the interpretations of the relevant results in this study are somewhat speculative and, therefore, should be taken cautiously.\nFourth, the gene expression data were acquired from six post mortem donor brains, whereas the brain structural MRI data were obtained from 223 living participants. Such inconsistency may obscure gene expression-cortical morphology associations with small effect sizes.\nFifth, the present study was carried out cross-sectionally. Future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the dynamic profiles of the morphologic abnormalities, WMH, and glymphatic dysfunction.\nIn conclusion, the present study revealed subtype-specific changes in cortical morphologic indices, WMH and DTI-ALPS, as well as significant associations among them in FTD. Our findings insinuate differential pathophysiology underwriting the distinct symptom profiles in the three FTD subtypes and may contribute potential pathways for the development of personalized treatment strategies for this disorder.",

In this study, transgenic mice overexpressing B-amyloid precursor protein (APP) under control of the plateletderived growth factor promoter (PDAPP mice) were examined using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to evaluate the extent of white matter injury before and following the development of AD-like pathology. The profile of DTI parameters was significantly different in old PDAPP mice compared to that of old control mice following the development of AD-like pathology. No difference in DTI parameters was observed between the young PDAPP and control mice. Our results suggest that as amyloid B (AB) deposition and levels increase over time in PDAPP mice, these changes lead to primary or secondary white matter injury that can be detected by DTI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as well as selective vulnerability of neurons and their connections (Giannakopoulos et al., 1998;Morrison, 1999;Mudher and Lovestone, 2002;Price and Morris, 1999). During the course of AD, neuronal injury is particularly prominent in large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of vulnerable layers of cortex (Morrison, 1999;Price et al., 2001).\nIt is also clear that both axons and dendrites, which account for most neuronal volume and surface area, are damaged during the process of neuronal cell body dysfunction and death. It is thus reasonable to anticipate that brain areas containing mostly axonal connections such as white matter would also be significantly affected by AD. In fact, increasing evidence demonstrates that there is marked damage and dysfunction not only in the gray matter but also in the white matter in AD (Han et al., 2002).\nNeuropathological and biochemical studies on white matter from AD subjects have demonstrated dramatic loss of myelin and axons (Bronge et al., 2002;Scheltens et al., 1995), DNA fragmentation (Forloni et al., 1993;Ivins et al., 1999;Jen et al., 1998;Yuan and Yankner, 2000), and selective loss of lipid components in the white matter (Han et al., 2001(Han et al., , 2002)). For example, recent studies found a dramatic loss of both plasmalogen and sulfatide in the white matter of subjects who died with the mildest degree of dementia due to AD (Han et al., 2001(Han et al., , 2002)). While cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is best known as a leading cause of lobar hemorrhage in the elderly and is a very common finding in AD (Olichney et al., 2000), these subjects had minimal to no white matter ischemia infarcts. Thus, white matter changes that are independent of ischemic infarcts occur very early during the clinical course of AD (Han et al., 2002).\nWhite matter lesions in aging and AD brains have been detected as hyperintensity in T2-weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance images (MRI) (Barber et al., 1999;Hirono et al., 2000;OBrien et al., 2000;Stewart, 2001), as increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) (Engelter et al., 2000;Kantarci et al., 2001;Nusbaum et al., 2001), and as reduced water diffusion anisotropy using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Bozzali et al., 2002;OSullivan et al., 2001;Pfefferbaum et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002). It is likely that some of these changes are due to small vessel disease (Barber et al., 1999). However, several studies demonstrate that structural white matter changes such as atrophy of the corpus callosum as well as ADC and anisotropy changes on DWIDTI are significantly greater in AD than in control subjects (Bozzao et al., 2001;Hampel et al., 2002;Hanyu et al., 1999;Kantarci et al., 2001;Nusbaum et al., 2001;Takahashi et al., 2002;Teipel et al., 2002). Shortening of corpus callosum length has also been observed recently in paraformaldehyde fixed PDAPP mouse brains using the three-dimensional magnetic resonance microscopy (Redwine et al., 2003). Thus, a combination of small vessel disease and processes intrinsic to AD pathology (e.g., myelinaxonal disruption due to AD pathology) may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of white matter lesions in AD detected using MRI. While the specific pathophysiological contributions to these imaging changes are difficult to quantify in humans, studies using transgenic mouse models of AD have the potential to clarify the white matter pathologies detected by MRI.\nIn this study, we have utilized PDAPP mice, a mouse model that develops age-dependent amyloid h (Ah) deposition and neuritic plaque formation (Games et al., 1995;Holtzman et al., 2000), combined with DTI to examine the white matter in mice before and following the development of AD-like pathology.",

Two age groups of mice were included in the study. The young group consisted of 3-monthold PDAPP (n  10) and control mice (n  10). The old group consisted of 15-month-old PDAPP (n  11) and control (n  8) mice. Mice were anesthetized with isofluraneO 2 (5 for induction and 2 for maintenance). Core temperature was maintained at 36.5jC using warm water circulating through a pad. After the appropriate anesthesia plane was reached, mice were placed in a custom-made magnetic resonance compatible stereotaxic device to immobilize the head. The inflow line of the inhalant and outflow of the exhaust were connected to a nose cone with vacuum line to remove excess isoflurane from the magnet bore. A 1.5-cm outer diameter circular surface coil was place on top of the head to serve as the receiver for the MR signal. The combined apparatus was placed in a custom-made cradle permitting the brain of each mouse to be at the center of the magnet inside a 9-cm inner diameter Helmholtz coil (the radio frequency transmit coil).",

In the CNS white matter, k 1 represents the water diffusivity parallel to the axonal fibers and is called k N , the axial diffusivity. The water diffusivities perpendicular to the axonal fibers, k 2 and k 3 , are averaged and called k ? u (k 2  k 3 )2, the radial diffusivity. The relative anisotropy map was then determined according to Eq. ( 2),\nwhere k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 are the principal diffusivities and D is the mean diffusivity. The diffusion tensor and the anisotropy index maps were derived using software written in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).\nThe DTI parameter maps, including RA, Trace(D)  k 1  k 2  k 3 , k ? , and k N were displayed and corresponding regions of interest, that is, the whole structure of seven white matter tracts including anterior commissure, corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle, external capsule, fornix, optic nerve, and optic tract, were selected across the mouse brain.

      "text": "Typical relative anisotropy (RA) maps of PDAPP and control mouse brains are displayed in Fig. 1. In the young mice (panels A and B), there was no difference between RA values of PDAPP (panel A) and control (panel B) mouse brains. It is apparent, however, that all white matter tracts in the old PDAPP (panel C) mouse brain exhibit lower RA values than those of the agematched control brain (panel D). Diffusion tensor parameters of each tract in all groups are displayed in Fig. 2.\nThe overexpression of h-amyloid precursor protein (APP) has no observed effect on DTI parameters when comparing young PDAPP mice to controls. In general, there was no significant difference between RA, Trace(D), axial diffusivity (k N ), or radial diffusivity (k ? ) between young PDAPP and nontransgenic mice. The only observed difference was the elevation of water diffusivity in the cerebral peduncle (Table 1) of young PDAPP mice comparing with those of the control mice. This is consistent with the histological finding that there is no detectable amyloid-related pathology in PDAPP mouse brains at this age. In contrast, significantly decreased RA, and significantly elevated Trace(D) and k ? are observed in 15-month-old PDAPP mouse brains vs. old nontransgenic control brains. The only exceptions to this were the anterior commissure and optic nerve (insignificantly decreased RA), and optic tract (insignificantly decreased RA and insignificantly increased k ? ).\nThere was no statistically significant change in axial diffusivity, k N , in old PDAPP mouse brains as compared with old nontransgenic controls with the only exception being the cerebral peduncle, where significantly elevated k N was observed. A significant elevation of k ? with the preservation of k N in the old PDAPP mouse brain may imply that myelin integrity of the white matter is affected by AD pathology at this stage of disease progression while axonal integrity is not impaired (Song et al., 2002).\nIn addition to DTI changes between PDAPP and control mice at 15 months, there were some age-related changes that occurred in control mice with aging. A general trend of decreased RA, Trace(D), k ? , and k N was seen in all tracts. However, only anterior commissure, corpus callosum, optic nerve, and optic tract showed a statistically significant decrease in RA in the old control mice. Only anterior commissure, cerebral peduncle, and optic tract had a significant decrease in k N . Anterior commissure and cerebral peduncle are the only tracts that showed significantly decreased Trace(D).\nPost-DTI Ah measurements of the external capsule were performed on PDAPP mouse brains. The 3-month-old PDAPP brains had no Ah deposition as expected (data not shown). A pathological examination of five PDAPP mice at 15 months of age that had also undergone DTI assessment was performed. These mice all had Ah immunoreactivity and amyloid deposition in the cortex, hippocampus, and to a lesser extent, within the external capsule (Table 2). A histological section of a PDAPP mouse brain showing extensive Ah deposition in the cortex and hippocampus with limited involvement in external capsule is shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, transmission EM analysis of amyloid plaques within the white matter (Fig. 4) show that in addition to amyloid fibrils, there are dystrophic axons, some of which have partially or completely lost their myelin sheath. In the 15-month-old brains, we also compared RA values with Ah load. There was not a significant correlation with the limited number of mice assessed.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "White matter lesions as seen in neuroimaging examinations of normal aging and AD patients are frequent and heterogeneous (Bozzali et al., 2002;Bronge et al., 2002;Chun et al., 2000;de Groot et al., 2000de Groot et al., , 2001;;de Leeuw et al., 2001;Desmond, 2002;Meyer et al., 1992;OBrien and Ames 1996;OBrien et al., 2000). The incidence of white matter lesions may reflect the severity of underlying pathologies. Recent reports have shown that white matter lesions detected as T2W hyperintensity are closely related to cognitive impairment in normal aging and AD. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the observed white matter lesion or the exact type of the injury has not been identified. In the present study, detailed analyses of white matter using DTI on mouse brains were performed noninvasively. Using this method, we found age-related abnormalities in a transgenic model of amyloid deposition in the absence of ischemic infarcts. This suggests that Ah accumulation and deposition may in some way be linked with white matter abnormalities that can be detected by DTI.\nDiffusion tensor imaging parameters describe tissue microstructures based on the characteristics of water diffusion (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Pierpaoli et al., 1996). Both mean ADC and RA have been used to infer changes in tissue morphology caused by AD and other diseases (Bozzali et al., 2002;Nusbaum et al., Fig. 3. A histological, coronal section of a 15-month-old PDAPP mouse brain showing extensive Ah deposition in the cortex and external capsule as detected with an anti-Ah antibody is presented. Although majority of Ah deposition is seen in the area of cortex and hippocampus, easily detectable deposition in the white matter is clearly shown (magnification is 20Â). Fig. 4. A transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of an amyloid plaque located within the white matter of a 15-month-old PDAPP mouse brain is presented. The four arrowheads mark the boundaries of the amyloid plaque. The large arrow points to a dystrophic axon associated with the plaque that still has a myelin sheath. The small arrow points to one of many dystrophic neurites surrounding the plaque. These most likely represent dystrophic axons that have lost their myelin (magnification is 6000Â, scale bar equals 5 Am). 2001; Rose et al., 2000). Pathologically nonspecific inferences described as white matter disconnection or disintegration has been commonly drawn based on changes in RA or ADC. Although very sensitive to various microstructural changes in tissue, as summary DTI parameters neither RA nor ADC is adequately suited for a more quantitative, pathology-specific analysis of white matter injury (Song et al., 2002).\nResults herein show that RA, Trace(D) (3 Â ADC), and k ? are significantly different in old PDAPP mice in comparison with those of old nontransgenic controls. However, there is no significant difference in k N between the two groups. A closer examination of the DTI parameter shows that the increased Trace(D) originates from the approximately 50 elevation of k ? . The maintenance of k N and significant elevation of k ? contribute to the observed RA decrease.\nA decrease in mean ADC caused by CNS injuries have been reported in many diseases including stroke, seizures, and tumors although a consensus regarding the underlying mechanism responsible for the observed change is yet to be reached. Since mean ADC is a summary parameter that reflects contributions from both k N and k ? (k N  2 k ? )3, it is thus expected that axial andor radial diffusivities may decrease in white matter injury. It is our contention that axonal injury without (or before) demyelination will impede the diffusion of water along the tract axis and thus significantly decrease the axial diffusivity with lesser detectable effect on the radial diffusivity (Song et al., 2002). The radial diffusivity is about 30 of the magnitude of the axial diffusivity due to the more restricted diffusion across the tract relative to that along the tract axis. Thus, a mean ADC change due to axonal injury without demyelination is most likely to be driven by a decrease in k N . Furthermore, the much smaller magnitude of the radial diffusivity makes a decrease of k ? more difficult to detect using DTI if injury is not severe.\nIn contrast to axonal injury, myelin damage or loss will result in an increased freedom for water molecules to move across white matter tracts. We have proposed this change will not have a marked impact on k N but will result in increased k ? . Thus, in the situation of demyelination without axonal injury, one expects to see elevated k ? without changes in k N (Song et al., 2002). Within this interpretive framework, results herein imply impaired myelin integrity of old PDAPP mouse brain white matter tracts with maintenance of axon microstructure. Such a conclusion cannot be drawn using conventional MRI or DTI summary parameters such as mean ADC or RA. The maintenance of axonal structural integrity observed herein is consistent with a recent study in AD patients using a new DTI parameter that measures intervoxel water diffusion coherence. Based on their finding of intervoxel coherence in water diffusion, Bozzali et al. (2002) concluded that the tissue disorganization of white matter in AD is relatively mild.\nRecent studies have shown that certain myelin components are significantly abnormal even in very mild AD (Han et al., 2001(Han et al., , 2002)). Han et al. (2001Han et al. ( , 2002) ) have recently reported that major lipid components, sulfatide and ethanolamine plasmalogen, are significantly decreased in cerebral white matter in AD. Importantly, sulfatide is produced by oligodendrocytes and is a specific component of myelin. Its levels were found to decrease by 50 in white matter in patients who died with very mild dementia due to AD (Han et al., 2002). Furthermore, Xu et al. (2001) reported that Ah peptides are cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes inducing a dose dependent cell death characterized by nuclear DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytoskeletal disintegration. These studies are consistent with a report that partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendrocytes has been observed in the white matter of AD patients (Brun and Englund, 1986). Our results show that a noninvasive detection of white matter abnormalities in a mouse model of AD is feasible with the use of k ? and k N . Though white matter abnormalities in human AD are likely due to several factors such as ischemic and other abnormalities, our DTI results suggest that the technique employed herein may be able to detect white matter changes linked to Ah-related damage.\nPlaque formation in the white matter is clearly seen in the EM of an old PDAPP mouse brain. Axonal destruction including both axonal injury and demyelination near the plaque is clearly demonstrated (Fig. 4). The Ah deposition in the external capsule is also readily detected in histological staining (Fig. 3). However, these lesions are scarcely in the subcortical white matter and rarely observed in deep white matter in PDAPP mice. Thus, despite histological evidence of local damage to both axons and myelin (Fig. 4), our DTI results suggest relatively greater impairment of myelin integrity of old PDAPP mouse brain white matter tracts with relative maintenance of axon microstructure. Our findings suggest that a consistent change of DTI parameters in all white matter tracts may imply that either (1) local insoluble Ah deposition is not the cause of the observed changes or (2) that local insoluble Ah results in remote damage. The age-related changes in DTI parameters seen in white matter of PDAPP mice occur along with the progression of AD-like pathology. Whether or not the insoluble Ah deposits play a role in the observed changes, possibly overall elevated Ah accumulation levels directly lead to white matter damage (Xu et al., 2001).\nIn spite of its widespread occurrence, white matter lesions detected by neuroimaging have been difficult to interpret. It has been suggested that white matter lesions reflect incomplete infarction and may be due to hypoperfusion, which in term may be caused by amyloid angiopathy (Olichney et al., 2000). In addition, Wallerian degeneration secondary to cortical neuronal loss has been suggested to cause the observed white matter lesions. Our RA and k ? measurements on PDAPP mice, which have no overt neuronal loss or amyloid angiopathy, may indicate that AD pathology alone could cause myelin injury in the white matter.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that DTI is sensitive for the noninvasive detection of white matter changes in the AD mouse. By quantifying the axial (k N ) and radial (k ? ) diffusivities, it is possible to associate the neuroimaging presentation with underlying pathology. Importantly, while PDAPP mice develop significant neuritic dystrophy coincident with amyloid deposition (Holtzman et al., 2000;Masliah et al., 1996), they do not develop cerebrovascular disease, gray or white matter infarcts, or appreciable neuronal loss (Irizarry et al., 1997). Although further studies with more animals will be required to fully validate the meaning of our findings, we found that at 3 months of age, DTI did not reveal significant differences between PDAPP and control mice. In contrast, 15-month-old PDAPP mice had marked and significant abnormalities seen by DTI in white matter tracts as compared to age-matched controls. These findings suggest that abnormalities of white matter may be directly associated with the formation of ADlike neuropathology and may be a consequence of Ah accumulationdeposition or its effects. Further, they suggest that DTI may be useful to assess the efficacy of various therapeutic interventions in mouse models of AD. It may be useful to explore further the similar use of DTI in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) patients show early changes in white matter (WM) structural integrity. We studied the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing WM alterations in the predementia stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to DTI and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging data from 35 amyloid-β42 negative MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42 -), 35 positive MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42  ), and 25 healthy controls (HC) retrieved from the European DTI Study on Dementia. The SVM was applied to DTI-derived fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MO) maps. For comparison, we studied classification based on gray matter (GM) and WM volume. RESULTS: We obtained accuracies of up to 68 for MO and 63 for GM volume when it came to distinguishing between MCI-Aβ42 -and MCI-Aβ42  . When it came to separating MCI-Aβ42  from HC we achieved an accuracy of up to 77 for MD and a significantly lower accuracy of 68 for GM volume. The accuracy of multimodal classification was not higher than the accuracy of the best single modality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DTI data provide better prediction accuracy than GM volume in predementia AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The revised diagnostic criteria for Alzheimers disease (AD) emphasize the use of neuroimaging biomarkers to support a diagnosis of AD in prodromal stages. 1,2 Pathological 3 and biochemical 4 analyses of white matter (WM) integrity reveal significant alterations in WM as the disease progresses. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assesses the structural integrity of WM fiber tracts 5,6 and may potentially complement the volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to measure brain atrophy. 7 From DTI we can derive scalar indices of anisotropic diffusion, the most widely used being fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Reduced FA or increased MD indicate impaired WM fiber tract integrity. 8,9 Previous studies have found a significant decline in fiber tract integrity in posterior cingulate, corpus callosum, and temporal and parietal lobe WM in AD dementia and prodromal AD. 10111213 The mode of anisotropy (MO), which reflects differences in the shape of the diffusion tensor, has been reported to provide useful information when it comes to discriminating subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from MCI subjects converting to AD dementia. 14 Establishing DTI as an imaging marker of AD requires studying its diagnostic performance in large samples across multiple sites. Only few studies have investigated multicenter variability of DTI derived measures of fiber tract integrity. 15161718 A previous study has shown that multicenter variability is about 50 higher in DTI derived FA measures compared to classical MRI volumetric measures of GM. 17 The question is unresolved to what extent the multicenter variability compromises the clinical utility of DTI for the detection of prodromal AD.\nMultivariate machine learning approaches are particularly sensitive to distributed disease-specific changes. One such approach is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, 19 a method which has been used successfully in several AD and MCI imaging studies involving GM volume 20212223 and DTI measures. 12,13,24252627 The multiple kernels SVM (MK-SVM) classifier 26,28,29 is an extension of the conventional SVM algorithm and permits the combined analysis of different imaging modalities. So far, studies using the MK-SVM have focused on MRI and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography Copyright  C 2015 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 1 (FDG-PET), 30,31 or on DTI and resting-state functional MRI. 26 They have all found the multimodal MK-SVM to be significantly more accurate than the single modality SVM. However, no studies to date have applied the SVM and MK-SVM classifiers to multicenter DTI, or combined DTI and MRI data from MCI subjects. This article extends our previous analyses of multicenter DTI and MRI data from AD patients and healthy controls (HC) 13 by incorporating data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid positive MCI subjects (prodromal AD) which recently became available through the European DTI Study on Dementia (EDSD). 13,17,323334",

      "text": "The data were taken retrospectively from the EDSD, 13,17,323334 a framework study involving eleven European centers: Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Brescia (Italy), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Dublin (Ireland), Frankfurt (Germany), Freiburg (Germany), Milan (Italy), Mainz (Germany), Mannheim (Germany), Munich (Germany), and Rostock (Germany). Over the course of 2013, the dataset was extended until it contained 159 DTI and MRI scans from patients with clinically probable AD, 146 scans from MCI subjects for whom CSF biomarker information andor follow-up conversion information was available, and 227 scans from HC. Written informed consent was provided by all the subjects or their representatives. The study was approved by the local ethics committees at each of the participating centers.\nAll participants were free of any significant neurological, psychiatric or medical condition. DTI and anatomical MRI scans were visually checked for quality to exclude scans with prominent artifacts such as ghosting, blurring due to motion, or strong susceptibility artifacts, and scans on which the brain was not entirely contained within the field of view.\nIn the present study, the CSF biomarker amyloid-β42 was used to identify the MCI subjects most likely to have prodromal AD. 353637 The MCI subjects for whom CSF information was available were stratified into an amyloid-β42 negative (MCI-Aβ42 -) group and an amyloid-β42 positive (MCI-Aβ42  ) group using previously established thresholds defined for each center individually. The sample we eventually used consisted of (i) 35 MCI-Aβ42 -versus 35 MCI-Aβ42  subjects from five centers, and (ii) 25 MCI-Aβ42  subjects versus 25 matched HC from three centers. The second sample was smaller than the first as HC data were not available for every center. The group characteristics are provided in Table 1. A more detailed overview of the subjects characteristics for each center is given in Tables S1 andS2. We included at minimum 12 subjects from each center in the analyses, as the scanner type as well as the scan parameters for the T 1 -weighted sequence and the DTI sequence differed across the centers (Table S3).",

    "Data Preprocessing": {
      "text": "Our method of data processing has been described in detail elsewhere. 13 DTI scans were preprocessed using the diffusion toolbox featured in the FMRIB Software Library (Version 5.0.4, Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK), 38 which included correction for eddy currents and head motion, an averaging of scan repetitions, skull stripping using the brain extraction tool, and finally the fitting of the diffusion-tensor model to the data. This last step calculated the scalar diffusion indices FA, MD, and MO, which were used for the subsequent analysis.\nThe anatomical T 1 -weighted scans were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (Release 4290, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) implemented in MAT-LAB (Release 2013a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). First of all, the anatomical images were automatically reoriented such that the anterior commissure was set as the origin of the coordinate system. They were then segmented into gray matter (GM), WM, and CSF and normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space using high-dimensional DARTEL normalization implemented in the Voxel-Based Morphometry 8 toolbox (Release 433). 39 We used a custom brain template previously created for the AD and HC cohort 13 and applied modulation for nonlinear components only. Finally, the normalized GM and WM volume maps were smoothed using an 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel and masked using a binary WM or GM mask derived from the template to restrict the subsequent analysis to the voxels within the corresponding areas only.\nThe DTI images were affinely aligned to the corresponding skull-stripped anatomical images using the brain-extracted nondiffusion weighted B 0 images as source images for the coregistration algorithm and applying the same transformation to the scalar FA, MD, and MO maps. After this, the deformation fields obtained for the anatomical images were applied to the DTI maps to project them into the MNI reference space. The maps were then masked with (i) a WM mask to preserve WM areas only (this mask was derived from the WM segment of the study template), and (ii) a second mask which removed large parts of the frontal lobe WM and the genu of the corpus callosum because of the presence of strong susceptibility artifacts in those areas in the scans received from some of the centers. To define the latter mask we visually inspected each scan and compared the overlap of the coregistered diffusion scan and the corresponding anatomical scan for misalignment. The excluded regions include the frontal lobe from z-slice 30 mm to 28 mm (MNI standard space), the anterior corpus callosum, and the anterior cingulum, and cropped the frontal lobe WM at the borderline to the medial temporal lobe WM. The WM mask and the excluded regions are shown in Figure S1. Finally, the DTI maps were smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.",

    "Classification Methods": {
      "text": "The data from all the centers were pooled and the following modalities selected: DTI-derived FA, MD and MO maps, and volumetric GM and WM maps derived from structural MRI. Initially, each modality was processed separately.\nThe learning and classification process involves five steps: (i) shuffling the subjects into a training set and an evaluation set, (ii) reducing the variance of the input images, (iii) selecting discriminative voxels, (iv) training the SVM classifier model using the training data, (v) evaluating the performance of the SVM model using the evaluation data. For learning and classification process we used the WEKA Data Mining Software (Version 3.6.8, Machine Learning Group, University of Waikato, New Zealand) 40 and custom scripts programmed in MATLAB (Release 2013a, The MathWorks).\nTo determine the general performance of the SVM classifier, we used a repeated tenfold cross-validation approach. Every subject was shuffled into one of ten folds from which one fold was selected as the evaluation dataset, with the remaining folds forming the training dataset (step i). The subjects were stratified by diagnosis, such that each fold contained approximately the same number of subjects from each diagnostic group. The subsequent steps (ii) to (iv) were performed blind to the evaluation dataset, with the parameters for the transformations (for ii) or masking operations (for iii) estimated from the training dataset. The classification process was repeated until each of the 10 folds had been used as the evaluation dataset once. Finally, we repeated the full cross-validation procedure 10 times using different permutations to shuffle the subjects into the folds for a more general approximation of the performance of the classifier.\nAs measures of performance we report mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity: accuracy  (TP  TN)n; sensitivity  TP(TP  FN); and specificity  TN(TN  FP ); with TP being true positives, TN being true negatives, FP being false negatives, and n being the total number of subjects. MCI-Aβ42  subjects are defined as positives, while MCI-Aβ42 -subjects and HC are defined as negatives. We also provide the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as confidence intervals, calculated using Microsoft Excel 2010. Finally, we report the mean ratio of support vectors, calculated as the number of support vectors divided by the number of training subjects. 19 This measure indicates the degree of complexity of the SVM model. A ratio of 100 indicates that the model is highly complex and overfitted to the training data, while a ratio of 50, for example, indicates that the model is less complex.\nWe used contingency tables to compare the coherence of the SVM models across the different modalities. These 2  2 tables permit a pairwise comparison of prediction error: T  (m 00 , m 01 ; m 10 , m 11 ). They contain the number of subjects incorrectly classified by both modalities m 00 , the number of subjects correctly classified by both modalities m 11 , and the number of subjects correctly classified by the first m 10 or the second modality m 01 , respectively. To measure the similarity of the predictions we calculated the Jaccard similarity coefficient 41 : J  m 11 (m 01  m 10  m 11 ).",

    "Variance Reduction": {
      "text": "Embedded into the cross-validation procedure we used two approaches to reduce the effect of the covariates age, education, gender, and center: (i) one based on principal component analysis (PCA) and (ii) one based on linear regression.\nWe had used the PCA approach in a previous study 13 where it was observed to effect a slight but statistically insignificant improvement in classification performance in comparison to that obtained using uncorrected imaging data. Basically, the matrix of training images (subjects by voxels) was decomposed into its eigenimages using PCA. The original images were then projected into the coordinate system spanned by the eigenimages such that the new coordinates for each subject represented the proportion of each eigenimage present in that subjects original image. The new coordinates were then correlated with the covariates to identify those eigenimages that contained a large amount of variance attributable to the covariates. On the basis of previous experience, 13 we set a Pearson correlation coefficient of r  .6 as the threshold for treating the eigenimages in question as noise factor and erasing them (by filling with zeroes) before projecting the new coordinates back into the original image space. The projection and cleaning procedure was also applied to the test data blind to the test subjects diagnosis information. See 13 for a more detailed description.\nThe linear regression model was used to estimate the effect of the covariates age, gender, years of education, center, and diagnosis on each voxel of the training sample:\nbeing the intensity of voxel j for subject i, β 0j . . . β 6j being the estimated regression parameters for voxel j, age i . . . diagnosis i being the covariates for subject i, and ε ij being the error for voxel j and subject i. The residual e ij for each voxel v ij was used for the subsequent analysis and calculated from the regression model-predicted intensity value without taking the effect of diagnosis into account:\nThis enabled us to reduce the effect of interaction, such as that between center and diagnosis, and was more accurate than a regression model without including the diagnosis variable. For the test dataset the residuals were calculated analogously using the same model coefficients β 0j . . . β 5j , the test subjects covariates, excluding the test subjects diagnosis information:",

      "text": "After segmentation and masking, the scans still contained approximately 250,000 voxels. As not all of those voxels contributed information about the diagnostic group, we used the entropy-based information gain (IG) criterion 13,21 to further reduce the number of voxels for analysis. The IG is an information-theoretic value describing how much a feature, in our case a particular voxel, contributes to the separation of the data. Following a procedure similar to that described in, 13 we excluded all voxels with an IG of zero from the data and applied a density-based clustering algorithm to additionally exclude noise voxels which did not belong to a cluster of at least seven voxels (the voxel in question and its six directly adjacent neighbors). To check how much this liberal threshold influenced the results, when estimating the optimal SVM parameters (as described below) we also determined the optimal IG threshold. To do so we used the IG percentiles p ࢠ .5, .7, .8, .9, .95, as the highest absolute IG values differed greatly between the training datasets.\nBefore applying the SVM algorithm to the data, every training dataset was rescaled such that the values of every feature ranged between zero and one. We then selected the SVM parameters C (margin width) and γ (radial basis function kernel width) using a grid search in the range of C  2 -1 , 2 0 , . . . , 2 7 and γ  2 -20 , 2 -19 , . . . , 2 -3 and an internal tenfold crossvalidation procedure which further divided the training dataset into ten folds to determine the optimal parameters. For each modality and variance reduction approach we selected the set of parameters which performed best across the internal crossvalidations.\nTo formally evaluate whether the performance was above chance level we used a permutation test approach. 42,43 Therefore, the diagnose labels for the subjects were randomly permuted, and the tenfold cross-validation was repeated including the steps variance reduction and feature selection. Subsequently, the accuracy of the SVM classifier was determined using the C and γ parameters from the original data. We repeated this procedure 100 times due to the high computational complexity of this approach. Thus, we obtained a sample D of r  10 measures of the accuracy for the original data (by repeated cross-validation), and a sample D  of k  100 measures for the accuracy obtained from the random data. Ojala and Garriga 43 experienced that these numbers allow a sufficiently accurate and stable estimate of the P value, which was determined as the proportion of accuracies for the random data that were greater than the accuracy for the original data 43 : k1), for each i  1, . . . , r. Finally, the mean P value was calculated as the mean of all p i .",

We selected three voxels from overlapping clusters of the mean sensitivity maps obtained for the different variance reduction approaches for MD and for GM volume for the MCI-Aβ42  versus HC dataset.

The number of informative features selected as input for the SVM algorithm ranged from approximately six hundred to 30,000 voxels for the IG threshold of zero. Increasing the IG threshold to the optimal threshold determined by grid search only changed results by -1 to 2 on average.\nWhen it came to separating between the MCI-Aβ42 -and MCI-Aβ42  groups, we obtained a mean accuracy of between 60 and 68 for the DTI indices and between 46 and 63 for the volumetric maps (Table 2; Fig 1). The accuracies for FA were significantly higher than those obtained for GM volume (two-sided paired t-test with P  .01). In the multimodal analyses the MK-SVM classifier reached a mean accuracy of between 66 and 68 (Table 2; Fig 1). When it came to discriminating between MCI-Aβ42  and HC we achieved a mean accuracy of between 50 and 77 for the DTI indices and between 48 and 68 for the tissue volume maps (Table 3; Fig 2). The accuracies for MD (uncorrected and linear regression corrected) were significantly higher than those for GM volume (two-sided paired t-test with P  .05). The MK-SVM reached accuracies of between 67 and 74 (Table 3; Fig 2). The ratio of support vectors ranged between 49 and 100 with a mean of 89 for the uncorrected data, 91 for the data corrected using PCA, callosum in MD for MCI-Aβ42 versus HC, but not in FA or MO for MCI-Aβ42-versus MCI-Aβ42. In the MCI-Aβ42 versus HC sample, GM volume revealed large clusters in regions of the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampus and amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, the inferior parietal lobe, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The full list of regions is provided in Table 4 for the MCI-Aβ42versus MCI-Aβ42 sample, and in Tables 5 and6 for the MCI-Aβ42 versus HC sample. The clusters are shown in Figure 3.\nThe mean correlations of voxel intensity and diagnosis for MD and GM volume for the MCI-Aβ42 versus HC sample are given in Tables S6 andS7, respectively.

For GM volume we selected the voxels -20, -3, -15 (left hippocampus), 20, -9, -14 (right hippocampus), and -21, 14, 2 (left inferior parietal gyrus). The correlation coefficients increased when correcting for the effects of covariates using linear regression (statistically significant only for MD with P  .04 for a two-sided paired t-test after applying the Fisher z-transformation). When correcting the data using PCA we obtained correlations which were equal to or lower than those obtained for the uncorrected data (the differences not being statistically significant).

    "Classifier Performance": {
      "text": "With an accuracy rate of up to 77 observed for the MD parameter in discriminating between MCI-Aβ42  subjects and HC, our results are comparable to the diagnostic accuracies of between 54 and 93 reported in earlier monocenter DTI SVM studies. 12,24,27,47 The accuracy rate for MD reported in this study is slightly lower than the 83 accuracy in distinguishing subjects with AD from HC obtained in our last study. 13 When it comes to GM volume, previous SVM studies have reported accuracies ranging from 61 to 75, 12,47,48 and this too ties in with our results of 62 to 68. The accuracy of GM volume in distinguishing between MCI-Aβ42  and HC differed significantly from the accuracy of MD in the linear regression-corrected dataset and was also significantly lower than our previous result of 89 in discriminating AD from HC. These results are consistent with studies using DTI and MRI which report that alterations in WM fiber tract integrity precede GM atrophy in early stages of AD. 49505152535455 As expected, accuracy rates were lower for the MCI-Aβ42 - versus MCI-Aβ42  comparison than for the MCI-Aβ42  versus HC comparison. Other studies report accuracies ranging from 59 to 98 using DTI 24,27,47 or GM volume 48,565758 when comparing amnestic versus non-amnestic MCI subjects or stable MCI subjects versus converters. It is intuitively more difficult to differentiate certain subtypes of cognitive impairment than to distinguish diseased patients from healthy subjects. Furthermore, the process of determining CSF biomarker concentrations and defining crisp cut-off values adds additional noise to diagnostic group information.\nIn accordance with the multimodal analysis results for the previous dataset, 26 the MK-SVM approach did not increase accuracy above the best single modality. Other studies 26,30,31 which have reported a significant increase in accuracy have all used different imaging modalities such as FDG-PET or restingstate functional MRI. This discrepancy may be caused by the intrinsic limitation of the MK-SVM that the combined kernel includes both the useful information as well as the variability of the different modalities. Another explanation would be that DTI and MRI provide two different perspectives of the same common process of the disease which more generically may be seen as a loss of structural integrity. Under this assumption it is likely that FDG-PET or functional MRI, capturing a different aspect of functional integrity, would contribute additional information and increase the prediction accuracy.",

    "Variance Reduction and Feature Selection": {
      "text": "A major problem with multicenter DTI and MRI data is the high level of variability induced by different scanning parameters and scanner hardware. One multicenter clinical and physical phantom study 17 reported 50 higher variability in FA values across centers than in those for GM volume. Although machine learning algorithms like the SVM are designed to work with noisy data, systematic noise or biases caused by the different centers are problematic and may decrease classifier performance. To reduce the variability of our data, we used two approaches: (i) one based on PCA and (ii) one based on linear regression. The drawback of the first is that it is completely data driven and yields the best results if the effect of the covariates and diagnosis are linearly independent from each other. The second approach estimates the effects of the covariates and of diagnosis directly but is also limited by interaction between the two.\nIt is not possible to decide which approach yields the best results by looking at accuracies only. We observed a high number of support vector ratios above 90 (Tables 2 and3) both in the uncorrected data and in the data that had been corrected using PCA, indicating that the SVM model is highly complex and tends to overfit the training data. This in itself is a reflection of the large variability of the data. We observed that the ratio of support vectors was lowest for linear regression-corrected data, whose lower variability resulted in a mean of 67 (Tables 2 and3). This agrees with the observation of the correlations of voxel intensity with diagnosis that indicated a reduction of variability for the regression-corrected data.\nIncreasing the IG threshold did not lead to higher levels of classification accuracy than those observed in connection with the strategy of including every voxel with the power to contribute to differentiation. This justifies our treatment of all discriminative voxels as input features. Other algorithms exist (as used in Refs 24,27,28) which exclude redundant features, for instance, but those approaches generally have the disadvantage of being computationally expensive, which is ineffective when it comes to voxel-based analyses involving thousands of voxels.\nWhen the grid search method is used to determine the optimal weights for each modality for the MK-SVM classifier, the apparently optimal set of weights may be counterintuitive and surprising (cf. Tables S4 andS5). We actually observed for several weight sets that the accuracy obtained via internal cross-validation was almost equally high. Furthermore, the high variability of the multicenter data may, in combination with the limited number of subjects available, cause the MK-SVM models to overfit to the training data.",

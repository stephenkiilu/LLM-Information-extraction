    "abstract": "Using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the present study investigates changes in both gray and white matter in the APPsw transgenic mouse (Tg2576), a model of h-amyloid plaque deposition associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). DTI analyses were performed in cross-sectional groups of transgene-positive and -negative mice at 8, 12, 16, and 18 months of age to assess the magnitude of water diffusion in gray matter (i.e., Tr(D)) and changes in diffusion in white matter that may be indicative of axonal degeneration (i.e., reduced water diffusion parallel to axonal tracts, k t ) and myelin degradation (i.e., increased water diffusion perpendicular to axonal tracts, k 8 ). No appreciable changes in gray or white matter were observed between the APPsw and the age-matched control mice at 8 months of age. Reduced Tr(D) and k t were observed in gray and white matter, respectively, for the APPsw mice at ages greater than 8 months, which coincides with the time period when appreciable amyloid plaque accumulation was confirmed by ex vivo histopathological studies. The decreases in k t suggest the presence of axonal injury in multiple white matter tracts of APPsw mice. Unlike k t , k 8 was unaltered between control and APPsw mice in most white matter tracts. However, in the corpus collosum (CC), k 8 increased at 16 and 18 months of age, suggesting the possibility of myelin damage in the CC at these later ages. This work demonstrates the potential for DTI as a noninvasive modality to detect evolving pathology associated with changes in tissue water diffusion properties in brain tissues.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Pathological changes in AD can be characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles along with neuronal and synaptic loss (Giannakopoulos et al., 1998;Mudher and Lovestone, 2002;Price and Morris, 1999). Although AD pathology has been well defined in postmortem histology, detection of its longitudinal progression and the correlation of the progression with the extent of the disease in live brain tissue remain elusive. A feasible and reliable noninvasive imaging modality offering a tractable biomarker of AD-associated pathology will greatly facilitate drug discovery efforts in both preclinical and clinical phases.\nMagnetic resonance imaging has been used to measure atrophy of brain tissues in patients with AD (Boxer et al., 2003;Chetelat and Baron, 2003;Fernandez et al., 2003;Foundas et al., 1997;Fox et al., 1996;Hampel et al., 1998;Karas et al., 2003;Matthews et al., 2003). Additional ADrelated metabolic (Block et al., 2002;Hattori et al., 2002;MacKay et al., 1996;Mohanakrishnan et al., 1997;Pettegrew et al., 1997;Schuff et al., 1998) and microscopic structural changes (Bozzali et al., 2002;Bozzao et al., 2001;Hanyu et al., 1997Hanyu et al., , 1998Hanyu et al., , 1999;;Horsfield and Jones, 2002;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002;Yoshiura et al., 2002) have also been observed using magnetic resonance-based techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Considerable evidence suggests that microscopic white matter pathology can be detected using DTI (Bozzali et al., 2002;Bozzao et al., 2001;Hanyu et al., 1997Hanyu et al., , 1999;;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2000). In the white matter of AD patients, an increase in the diffusion coefficient and a decrease in diffusion anisotropy have been observed (Bozzali et al., 2002;Hanyu et al., 1997), although not always replicated (Bozzao et al., 2001;Kantarci et al., 2001). However, little is known about age-related changes in white matter diffusivity or its correlation with pathology such as brain amyloid plaque burden. The objective of the present study was to assess changes in white matter diffusivity in a transgenic mouse model with age-dependent amyloid plaque deposition. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that white matter pathology is age dependent and that this pathology can be detected using DTI protocols.\nThe study described herein examines APPsw mice and wild-type age-matched transgene-negative control mice at four different ages (8, 12, 16, and 18 months). The ages selected correspond to a period of dramatic increase in plaque burden, from minimal plaque load at 8 months to a significant plaque burden at 18 months (Hsiao et al., 1996). DTI protocols were used to calculate the trace of the diffusion tensor (Tr(D)), the relative diffusion anisotropy (RA), the axial diffusivity (k t , water diffusion parallel to the axonal tract), and the radial diffusivity (k 8 , water diffusion perpendicular to the axonal tract). Since k t and k 8 have been shown to be sensitive noninvasive indices of axonal injury and demyelination, respectively (Song et al., 2002(Song et al., , 2003)), examination of these DTI indices may provide a sensitive probe of microscopic changes in brain tissue that reflect disease progression, and yield new insights into the neurodegeneration associated with AD.",

      "text": "The production, breeding, and genotyping of the strain of APPsw (Tg2576) mice used in this study have been previously described (Hsiao et al., 1996;Lanz et al., 2003). Four groups of eight transgene-positive, heterozygous APPsw mice (Hsiao et al., 1996) and an equal number of age-matched transgene-negative control mice of the same genetic background (B6SJL) were subjected to DTI at the ages of 8, 12, 16, and 18 months. Both male and female mice were utilized and randomized across groups. All procedures in this study have been approved and were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (9 CFR Parts 1, 2, and 3) and the bGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory AnimalsQ (ILAR, 1996), as well as with all internal institutional policies and guidelines.\nMice were anesthetized with isofluraneO 2 (5 for induction and 2 for maintenance) while maintaining core temperatures at 36.58C using warm water circulating through a pad. After the appropriate anesthesia plane was reached, mice were placed in a custom-made magnetic resonance compatible head holder to immobilize the head. The inflow line of the inhalant was connected to a nose cone containing an outflow scavenging vacuum line to remove excess isoflurane from the magnet bore. A 1.5-cm outer diameter circular surface coil was positioned on top of the head to serve as the receiver for the MR signal. The combined apparatus was placed in a custom-made cradle permitting the brain of each mouse to be placed at the center of the magnet inside a 9-cm inner diameter Helmholtz radio frequency transmit coil. This animal cradle was positioned in another custom made cradle to slide into an Oxford Instruments 200330 (4.7 Tesla, 33 cm clear bore) magnet equipped with a 15-cm inner diameter actively shielded Oxford gradient coil (180 mTm, 200-As rise time). The magnet, gradient coil, and Oxford gradient power supply were interfaced with a Varian UNITY-INOVA console controlled by a Sun Microsystems Ultra-60 Sparc workstation.",

      "text": "A conventional multislice spin-echo imaging sequence, modified by adding a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion-sensitizing gradient pair, was employed for acquisition of a series of diffusion-weighted MR images (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1998). The diffusion-weighted images of 25 coronal slices were acquired with the following acquisition parameters: repetition period (TR) 1.5 s; spin echo time (TE) 50 ms; time between application of gradient pulses (D) 25 ms; diffusion gradient duration (y) 10 ms; eight averages; slice thickness 0.5 mm; field-of-view 1.5 Â 1.5 cm; and, data matrix 128 Â 128 (zero filled to 256 Â 256). Diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along six directions: Gx,Gy,Gz  1,1,0, 1,0,1, 0,1,1, À1,1,0, 0,À1,1, and 1,0,À1. The diffusion-sensitizing factor (b value) for the diffusionweighted images was 764 smm 2 . Additionally, an image with no diffusion weighting (b  0) was acquired. Each DTI data set covering the whole brain was obtained during a total acquisition time of 3 h. Data sets that exhibited motion artifacts were excluded from subsequent analysis, leaving eight transgene-positive and eight or nine transgene-negative mice available for analysis at each age.",

      "text": "The six independent elements of the diffusion tensor were calculated from each series of diffusion-weighted images. The resulting tensor element maps were used to derive the eigenvalues (k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 ) and eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor by matrix diagonalization (Basser, 1995;Basser andPierpaoli, 1996, 1998;Sun et al., 2001Sun et al., , 2003)). The DTI indices Tr(D), k t , k 8 , and RA were derived on a pixel-by-pixel basis using software written in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as defined by the following equations:\nwhere bDN; is Tr(D) divided by 3. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined for both gray and white matter using a mouse brain atlas as a reference (Franklin and Paxinos, 1997). In gray matter, the cortex (CT) and the hippocampus (HP) were selected. In white matter, the ROI included the anterior commissure (AC), corpus callosum (CC), cerebral peduncle (CP), external capsule (EC), optic nerve (ON), and optic tract (OT). The images with no diffusion weighting (b  0), as well as parametric maps of the DTI indices (RA, Tr(D), k t , and k 8 ), were displayed and used to guide the selection of the ROI for each slice of the multislice data. These ROIs were then combined across slices to yield a single ROI for each structure. In a supplementary analysis, the CC ROIs for the 16-month-old mice were independently defined by a second person that was blinded to the genotype of the mice. This procedure used just primarily the images with no diffusion weighting to define the ROIs (although small adjustments were occasionally made based on a colorized map of the direction of the first eigenvector). The differences in the DTI measurements resulting from these two different segmentations of the CC ROI averaged less than 1.5 for each of the four DTI indices. (This percentage was calculated as the average across mice of the absolute value of the difference in the DTI measure resulting from the two segmentations divided by the mean of the DTI measure for the two segmentations.) The excellent agreement in the DTI results for the two segmentations of the CC indicates that the results were relatively insensitive to the precise manner in which the ROIs were defined.",

A general linear modeling procedure (PRO GLM) from SAS System for Windows V9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to perform the statistical calculations. For the ROIs that exhibited a significant main effect of transgene, or a significant interaction of transgene Â age ( P b 0.05), twosample post hoc t tests were performed to identify ages for which the APPsw and control mice differed ( P b 0.05).",

The brain was removed and immersion fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h at 48C. After fixation, the brain was cryoprotected in 30 sucrose in PBS at 48C and frozen in powdered dry ice. Tissue sections were then cut in the coronal plane at 50 Am on a freezing sliding microtome. For quantitative analysis of Ah-immunoreactive (Ah-IR) deposits, every sixth section throughout the extent of the cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were immunostained with a pan Ah antibody as described previously (DeMattos et al., 2002). Utilizing these sections, the percent of the brain region covered by Ah-immunoreactivity ( Ah load) was determined using unbiased stereology (DeMattos et al., 2002). Ah load was determined for four APPsw mice at 8 months, nine mice at 12 months, eight mice at 16 months, and six mice at 18 months.",

    "DTI indices": {
      "text": "Examples of parametric maps for the DTI indices are shown in Fig. 1 for representative 16-month-old control and APPsw mice. The RA maps in Fig. 1 clearly delineate white matter tracts. Tr(D) represents the summation of the three eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor. With a scaling factor of 13, Tr(D) can be considered the directionally averaged diffusion coefficient. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the highest Tr(D) in the brain. White matter regions and CSF exhibit high k t because water diffusion along axons in white matter and isotropically within the CSF experiences less restriction than water diffusion perpendicular to the white matter tracts. In contrast, k 8 in the white matter is much lower than k 8 in the gray matter and the CSF. Although differences in image contrast between the different types of parametric maps were obvious, between control and APPsw mice in the maps for a given DTI parameter were generally difficult to detect by visual inspection. Examples of the ROIs used to quantify the DTI indices in gray and white matter are shown in Fig. 2 for a transgene negative, 8-month-old control mouse.\nIn the gray matter, we examined the cerebral cortex (CT) and hippocampus (HP) for changes in Tr(D). Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of transgene on Tr(D) in both the CT ( F(1,57)  4.3, P  0.04) and the HP ( F(1,57)  9.1, P  0.004), but no main effect of age ( F(3,57) b 0.5, P N 0.7) and no interaction between age and transgene ( F(3,57) b 1.1, P N 0.4) in either structure. Post hoc t tests indicated significant decreases (7-11) in both CT and HP of the APPsw mice at the ages of 12 and 18 months compared with the age-matched control mice (Fig. 3).\nIn white matter, four DTI indices (RA, Tr(D), k t , and k 8 ) were analyzed. With the exception of the CC, the white matter tracts exhibited similar patterns of change in the DTI indices. Thus, we first describe the results for the bnon-CCQ fiber tracts. There was a significant main effect of transgene on k t in all of the non-CC white matter tracts ( F(1,57) N 5.3, P b 0.03) due to varying levels of decrease in k t in the APPsw mice relative to age-matched control mice at ages equal to or greater than 12 months (Table 1). In general, these white matter tracts showed roughly a 9-15 reduction in k t for the APPsw mice at ages greater than 8 months. There was also a nearly significant effect of transgene on Tr(D) in all of Fig. 2. Regions of interest selected on a representative series of RA maps from a control 8-month-old mouse. (3)). In contrast to k t and Tr(D), the non-CC white matter tracts exhibited no significant effect of transgene on k 8 ( F(1,57) b 3.4, P N 0.07) and RA ( F(1,57) b 2.2, P N 0.1). There was generally no statistically significant effect of age, and no interaction of age Â transgene, for any of the DTI indices in the non-CC white matter tracts  P N 0.09 except for an effect of age on RA in the OT ( P  0.02), an effect of age on RA and k 8 in the CP ( P b 0.001), and an interaction of age Â transgene for RA in the EC ( P  0.04).\nThe corpus callosum exhibited a somewhat different pattern of diffusivity changes relative to the other white matter tracts (Fig. 4). Similar to other white matter, there was a main effect of transgene on k t in the CC ( F(1,54)  7.4, P  0.009), with k t decreasing by 10-14 in APPsw mice relative to control mice at ages greater than 8 months (Table 1). However, unlike the other white matter tracts, k 8 appears to vary with age in the CC of APPsw mice, as evidenced by a significant interaction of age Â transgene in the two-way ANOVA ( F(3,54)  5.6, P  0.002). Post hoc t tests indicated a significant decrease of 15.1 in k 8 in the APPsw mice relative to control mice at 12 months ( P  0.03), but significant increases of 31.2 ( P b 0.001) and 14.5 ( P  0.04) at 16 and 18 months, respectively. The opposing directions of change in k t and k 8 at these latter ages help to explain why, in contrast to the other white matter tracts, there was no significant effect of transgene on Tr(D) in the CC (see Eq. (3); F(1,54)  1.2, P  0.3). RA in the CC exhibited highly significant effects of transgene ( F(1,54)  20.7, P b 0.001) and the interaction transgene Â age ( F(3,54)11.0, Pb 0.001), as well as a less significant main effect of age ( F(3,54)  3.5, P  0.02). Post hoc t tests indicated significant decreases in RA of 22 ( P b 0.001) and 14 ( P  0.004) in the CC of APPsw mice relative to control mice at 16 and 18 months, respectively, which is again consistent with the fact that k t decreased while k 8 increased at these two ages.",

    "Ab load": {
      "text": "h-Amyloid (Ah) loads in the CC, CT, and HP of APPsw mice are summarized in Fig. 5. No appreciable Ah deposition was evident in APPsw mice at 8 months. Measurable Ah load was observed, however, at 12 months and increased further at 16 months. The Ah load was variable across the different anatomical areas. Gray matter (CT and HP) had higher levels of Ah load than the white matter (CC). Since Ah load was assessed only on a subset of animals subjected to DTI, a rigorous test of the correlation between Ah load and DTI changes within individual age groups could not be performed. Nonetheless, we examined the Pearson correlation between Ah load and DTI measures by aggregating all mice for which both measures were available (N  18 total; 3, 4, 6, and 5 mice at 8, 12, 16, and 18 months, respectively). There was a trend toward a positive correlation between Tr(D) in the CT and Ah load in the CT (r 2  0.20, P  0.06), but no such trend between Tr(D) in the HP and Ah load in the HP (r 2  0.11, P  0.18). In the CC, there was no correlation between the DTI indices (RA, Tr(D), k t , and k 8 ) and Ah load measured in the CC (r 2 b 0.1, P N 0.2). However, there were significant negative correlations between RA in the CC and Ah load in gray There was a significant main effect of transgene on k t in all white matter tracts ( P b 0.03). Two-way ANOVA also indicated a significant interaction of age Â transgene for k 8 in the CC. Post hoc t tests were therefore performed for these particular ROIs and measures to identify ages with significant differences between APPsw and control mice. P b 0.05; P b 0.01 in the t test. All units in Am 2 ms; percent change is (APPsw À control) Â 100control. Fig. 5. h-Amyloid (Ah) load quantified in corpus callosum (CC), cortex (CT), and hippocampus (HP). Negligible Ah load was evident in 8-monthold APPsw mice, but increased profoundly at 12 and 16-18 months of age. Gray matter (CT and HP) displayed higher Ah load than the corpus callosum. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare Ah load between the 12 vs. 16 and 16 vs. 18 months age groups. Ah load in all three structures was significantly different between 12 and 16 months ( P b 0.005), but did not differ for any of the three structures between 16 and 18 months ( P N 0.25). Each bar represents the mean F SD (N  4, 9, 8, and 6, at 8, 12, 16, and 18 months, respectively). Values are based on all mice for which Ah load was determined, which includes some mice that were excluded from the DTI analysis due to motion artifacts.\n(i.e., CT or HP; r 2  0.26-0.28, P  0.02-0.03), and a trend toward positive correlations between k 8 in the CC and Ah load in gray matter (r 2  0.20-0.22, P  0.05-0.06). Thus, RA and k 8 in the CC were better correlated with Ah load in the gray matter than with Ah load in the CC itself, although, at most, only approximately 30 of the variance in these measures was explained by the variation in Ah load.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Using a mouse model of progressive brain amyloidosis, the present in vivo DTI study demonstrates white matter changes that are age dependent. Changes in the DTI indices between APPsw and age-matched control mice were not observed until the age (greater than 8 months) at which APPsw mice are known to show significant increases in Ah deposition (Tomidokoro et al., 2001;Wegiel et al., 2003). However, the magnitude of these changes did not increase progressively with increasing age between 12 and 18 months, which helps explain why there was generally no significant effect of age or age Â transgene in the two-way ANOVA analyses. The data from the present study, as well as from another transgenic mouse model of brain amyloidosis (the PDAPP mouse; Song et al., 2004), are consistent with clinical reports in Alzheimers patients demonstrating a significant decrease in water diffusion anisotropy in some subcortical white matter regions, such as the corpus callosum (Bozzali et al., 2002;Hanyu et al., 1999;Takahashi et al., 2002). However, it should be noted that inconsistencies exist among the clinical studies regarding the specific brain regions that exhibit changes in water diffusion anisotropy. For example, Bozzali et al. (2002) reported decreased diffusion anisotropy in the frontal white matter of AD patients, while Kantarci et al. (2001) and Takahashi et al. (2002) observed no change in anisotropy in this region. Outstanding discrepancies highlight the need to identify and characterize the temporal evolution of diffusion anisotropy in clinical settings, a need that also exists in preclinical studies of animal models of AD.\nA thorough investigation of the temporal changes in DTI indices and associated pathology is likely to help unravel conflicting observations related to white matter injury in AD patients. For example, certain DTI changes seen in elderly humans with AD may be due to ischemic changes, while others may be related to Ah deposition and associated injury. Since neurofibrillary tangles are not observed in the APPsw mice (Higgins and Jacobsen, 2003;Janus et al., 2001), the DTI changes in the mouse models are likely secondary to Ah-related damage over time. In addition to the variable etiologies and pathological load experienced by AD subjects, most of the previous clinical studies acquired data from a single time point without considering the progressive changes in diffusion properties that may occur as AD pathology worsens, which may well lead to different results depending on the pathological stage of disease. Furthermore, most reported clinical studies employing DTI focus only on summary indices such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and ADC (i.e., 13 of Tr(D)) without considering axial and radial diffusivity (k t and k 8 ).\nAs previously described (Song et al., 2002(Song et al., , 2003)), k t and k 8 can be used to probe the extent of axonal injury and demyelination, respectively, in white matter. Based on these findings, the decrease in k t beginning at 12 months for the white matter tracts in the present study may indicate the presence of axonal injury in these fiber tracts. In most white matter tracts, k 8 was unaltered between APPsw and control mice. However, in the CC, k 8 was decreased at 16 and 18 months, which may reflect demyelination at these ages. Thus, while all the white matter tracts that were examined appear to exhibit axonal injury starting around 12 months, additional age-dependent processes may lead to subsequent myelin degradation in the CC. If myelin degradation is also occurring in the other white matter tracts, it appears, based on k 8 , that this degradation is less pronounced than in the CC.\nThe present study extends the findings of our previous report examining another overexpressing h-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice model, the PDAPP mouse (Song et al., 2004). In this previous study, the changes in the DTI parameters were significantly different in old (15 month) PDAPP mice (which exhibited significant Ah-deposition) compared to that of age-matched control mice. No difference in DTI parameters was observed between the young (3 month) PDAPP and age-matched control mice. Similar to the present study, our previous results show a significant increase in k 8 in the CC of old PDAPP mice. The evidence of changes in CC diffusivity in aged, but not young (pre-plaque), mice from two distinct APP transgenic lines implicates a potential role of hamyloid in the observed DTI changes.\nHistological examination of amyloid plaque pathology in the brain tissue of APPsw mice reveals the progression of AD-like pathology in these animals. Consistent with previous electron microscopy studies (Tomidokoro et al., 2001;Wegiel et al., 2003), the current study shows an increase in Ah load in gray matter (CT and HP) and in white matter (CC) for APPsw mice at 12 months, and a higher Ah load in APPsw mice at 16 and 18 months. Notably, reductions in Tr(D) in gray matter and k t in white matter were not observed until an age (12 months) at which Ah load begins increasing dramatically. Overall, however, the DTI parameters did not correlate particularly well with Ah load. While increased Ah load might contribute to DTI changes early in the disease process, the current findings suggest it might not be the major or the only component contributing to the DTI observations made later in the disease process. Other cellular changes, such as cytotoxic edema, cell swelling, axonal degeneration, or demyelination may also have a prominent impact upon water diffusion (Le Bihan, 2003). It should be noted also that APP transgenic mice, including the APPsw mice used here, do not fully recapitulate the full pathology of clinical AD (e.g., presence of neurofibrillary tangles and progressive cell death). Hence, although clinical studies of AD patients provide evidence of microscopic white matter pathology detected using DTI (Bozzali et al., 2002;Bozzao et al., 2001;Hanyu et al., 1997Hanyu et al., , 1999;;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2000), the contributing pathological factors may be distinctly different between the mouse models and human patients.\nIn conclusion, the parameters k t and k 8 , derived from a DTI analysis, may provide probes of morphological changes in the white matter of APPsw mice. Consistent with some reports in human AD patients and our previous study in PDAPP mice, selective changes in white matter for APPsw mice have been shown. Additionally, the study demonstrated that measurements of k t and k 8 provide important information for understanding alterations in Tr(D) and RA (or FA). Decreases k t at 12 months seemed to relate to early deposition of Ah detected by histology, even though, once the deposition began, there was little correlation between Ah load and DTI measurements. Overall, the combination of k t and k 8 measurements may serve as a valuable tool for evaluating white matter pathologies in animal models of AD and eventually enable new insights for potential clinical interventions.",

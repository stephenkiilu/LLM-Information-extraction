    "abstract": "Background: Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is common among older adults. Increasing evidence suggests that SMI is a risk factor for future cognitive decline, as well as for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, are affected in the early stages of Alzheimers disease. The current study examined the gray matter (GM) volume and microstructural changes of hippocampal and entorhinal regions in individuals with SMI, compared with elderly control participants without memory complaints. Methods: A total of 45 participants (mean age: 70.31  6.07 years) took part in the study, including 18 participants with SMI and 27 elderly controls without memory complaints. We compared the GM volume and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in the hippocampal and entorhinal regions between SMI and control groups. Results: Individuals with SMI had lower entorhinal cortical volumes than control participants, but no differences in hippocampal volume were found between groups. In addition, SMI patients exhibited DTI changes (lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity in SMI) in the hippocampal body and entorhinal white matter compared with controls. Combining entorhinal cortical volume and FA in the hippocampal body improved the accuracy of classification between SMI and control groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the entorhinal region exhibits macrostructural as well as microstructural changes in individuals with SMI, whereas the hippocampus exhibits only microstructural alterations.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Subjective memory impairment (SMI), typically defined by subjective memory complaints and cognitive performance within the normal adjusted range (Jessen et al., 2014), is common among elderly people. Evidence suggests that SMI is a risk factor for future cognitive decline, as well as for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (Glodzik-Sobanska et al., 2007;Jessen et al., 2010). In addition, biomarker studies have reported increased prevalence of Alzheimers disease (AD)-type pathology in individuals with SMI (Visser et al., 2009;Peter et al., 2014). Taken together, these findings suggest that SMI may be a symptomatic indicator of preclinical AD (Jessen et al., 2014). However, the biological basis of SMI is not comprehensively understood.\nMedial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, are affected in the early stages of AD (Braak and Braak, 1991). A number of studies have investigated MTL structures in SMI patients, reporting reduced volumes in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and thinning of the entorhinal cortex (van der Flier et al., 2004;Jessen et al., 2006;Striepens et al., 2010;Meiberth et al., 2015;Schultz et al., 2015). However, few studies have examined brain microstructural alterations in SMI (Selnes et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012). In addition, to our knowledge, no prior studies have specifically investigated both volumetric changes and microstructural alterations of MTL structures in SMI.\nCurrent study investigated gray matter (GM) volume (measured with structural MRI) and microstructural alterations (measured with diffusion tensor imaging; DTI) of hippocampal and entorhinal regions in patients with SMI, compared with elderly controls without memory complaints, to better understand the relationship between GM volume and microstructural alterations in MTL structures.",

      "text": "A total of 45 individuals (mean age: 70.31  6.07 years) participated in this study, including 18 individuals with SMI and 27 healthy elderly controls. Individuals with SMI were enrolled from the memory clinic at our institution, after they were referred to the clinic for memory complaints. Elderly controls were recruited from the general population via advertisements. All participants provided a detailed medical history and underwent physical and neurological examinations, a neuropsychological test, laboratory tests, and a brain MRI scan. Demographic characteristics are given in Table 1.\nSMI was defined as complaints of memory decline despite normal performance on tests of cognitive abilities, including memory (above -1.5 SD of age-and education-adjusted norms). Elderly controls without memory complaints were assessed using a questionnaire of the 28 illnesses proposed by Christensen et al. (1992). Elderly controls did not report any concerns regarding decline in memory capacity and had normal cognitive performance on tests of cognitive tests (above -1.5 SD of age-and education-adjusted norms). Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of all participants were above -1.5 SD of age-and education-adjusted norms.\nParticipants were excluded if they had major neurological or medial illnesses that could cause cognitive impairment, current, or past major psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder), history of alcohol or substance abuse, significant MRI abnormalities (e.g. severe white matter (WM) hyperintensities, multiple lacunes, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumor, or other focal lesions), or abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. abnormal thyroid function, low vitamin B12, or low folate, positive syphilis serology). In addition, any subjects taking psychoactive medications that could possibly affect cognitive function (e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, chronic anxiolytics or sedative hypnotics, etc.) were excluded.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution. All participants provided informed consent.",

Neuropsychological tests included tests for attention, confrontational naming, visuospatial function, verbal and visual memory function, and frontal executive function. In addition, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Bae and Cho, 2004), which includes 30 items. Scores on this scale range from 0 to 30, and higher scores indicate stronger depressive symptoms. A score of  18 on the GDS is considered to indicate depression (Bae and Cho, 2004).",

Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were measured using the region-ofinterest (ROI) method in the bilateral hippocampi and entorhinal regions (Figure 1). Regarding FA and MD (i.e. the two most common DTI parameters), decreased FA and elevated MD are thought to reflect a loss of WM integrity including disruption of axonal structure or myelin loss in aging, MCI, and AD (Chua et al., 2008). Each ROI was a 3D voxel of interest with a size of 19 mm 3 . Spherical ROIs were drawn comparing the various images in various planes (coronal, axial, and sagittal planes) and based on the identification of WM on color-coded maps. The hippocampal ROIs were placed over the hippocampal bodies to exclude perihippocampal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, using a previously described protocol (Hong et al., 2013). The entorhinal ROI was placed over WM underlying the entorhinal cortex of the axial slice where the midbrain was visible, corresponding to the coronal slice of the midbrain level where the hippocampal body and entorhinal cortex appear together. Anatomical landmarks according to Bernasconi et al. (2003) were used for hippocampal and entorhinal ROIs. Illustrations of the hippocampal and entorhinal ROI are displayed in Figure 1.\nTo determine DTI data reliability, two raters measured hippocampal FA and MD values on ten randomly selected participants (five individuals with SMI and five elderly controls), blinded to the diagnosis. Inter-rater reliabilities expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.92 for hippocampal FA and 0.89 for hippocampal MD, respectively. Each ROI was then manually drawn by one rater blinded to the clinical information. The FA and MD values for each ROI were measured three times, and the mean value was obtained. DTI measures for each hippocampal and entorhinal ROI were averaged across hemispheres. Intra-rater reliabilities expressed as ICCs for the hippocampal body and entorhinal WM ROI placement ranged from 0.76 to 0.93.",

      "text": "The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, education, and sex between individuals with SMI and elderly controls. However, individuals with SMI had significantly lower K-MMSE scores (U  149.5, p  0.03, effect size r  0.33) and higher CDR sum of boxes (U  67.5, p  0.001, r  0.76) compared with elderly controls. Neuropsychological tests revealed that the SMI group had lower verbal memory scores (Seoul Verbal Learning Test delayed recall) than elderly controls (18 SMI patients vs. eight controls due to missing data; U  13.0, p  0.001, r  0.64; Table 1). Unfortunately, neuropsychological data from 19 participants in the control group were missing, so this finding remains to be inconclusive. Although individuals with SMI performed numerically poorer on the verbal memory measure, verbal memory performance of the SMI group is still considered within the normal range.\nThe SMI group had lower entorhinal cortical volumes than the control group (p  0.001, Cohens d  1.45). However, there was no difference in hippocampal volume between the two groups. DTI measures of the hippocampal body revealed significantly lower FA (p  0.001, d  1.5) 1).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, GM volumes and DTI measures of entorhinal and hippocampal regions were examined in SMI and control groups. The results revealed lower entorhinal cortical volumes in individuals with SMI, without hippocampal volumetric changes. In addition, we found DTI changes (lower FA and higher MD values compared with controls) in the hippocampal body and entorhinal WM in individuals with SMI. These findings suggest that entorhinal regions exhibit macrostructural and microstructural changes in people with SMI, whereas the hippocampus exhibits only microstructural alterations. Among the various measures of MTL structures we tested, entorhinal cortical volume and hippocampal body FA were superior for distinguishing SMI and control participants. Moreover, combining entorhinal cortical volume and hippocampal body FA improved classification accuracy for group comparisons.\nIn the current study, GM volumes measured with structural MRI revealed reduced entorhinal cortical volumes in SMI individuals, consistent with prior reports (Jessen et al., 2006;Striepens et al., 2010). In contrast, we found no differences in hippocampal volumes between SMI and control groups, in accord with several previous studies (Jessen et al., 2006;Saykin et al., 2006;Selnes et al., 2012;Schultz et al., 2015). However, some previous studies of hippocampal volume in SMI have revealed conflicting results (van der Flier et al., 2004;Saykin et al., 2006;Striepens et al., 2010). These discrepancies in the literature may relate to the different study populations and methodologies.\nFew previous studies have used DTI measures to evaluate microstructural changes in individuals with SMI (Selnes et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012). One DTI study of MTL structures reported that a cognitive complaint group demonstrated intermediate DTI diffusivity values in parahippocampal WM falling between an MCI group and a healthy control group (Wang et al., 2012). Another study demonstrated that subjective cognitive impairment was associated with DTI changes in the parahippocampal region, but no change in the entorhinal region (Selnes et al., 2012). The current results revealed DTI changes in hippocampal and entorhinal regions in individuals with SMI. These inconsistencies may be related to the methodological variability between studies, different populations, and variability in ROI definitions. Given the small number of DTI studies in SMI individuals, it would be helpful for future studies to provide further validation with larger populations.\nThe current study examined MTL structures in individuals with SMI, finding entorhinal cortical volume changes without hippocampal volume changes, as well as detecting microstructural alterations in both hippocampal and entorhinal regions. This discrepancy in the hippocampal region may be related to the characteristic pattern of neurofibrillary pathology of AD, in which the transentorhinal stages I-II (the earliest stage of AD) are characterized by more involvement in the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions, with only mild effects in the hippocampus (Braak and Braak, 1991). There is an increasing interest in the identification of patients in the earliest stages of AD to enable effective early intervention. Structural brain MRI and DTI may be useful in clinical practice for detection of patients with an increased risk of developing clinical AD. The current results revealed DTI changes in the hippocampal region in SMI patients, but no macrostructual volume changes. In addition, among brain measures in MTL structures, entorhinal cortical volume and hippocampal body FA were found to have relatively good classification accuracy, which was further improved by combining both entorhinal cortical volume and hippocampal body FA. The current results thus suggest that combined volumetric and DTI assessment may be helpful for detecting patients at risk and characterizing microstructural alterations of MTL structures in people with SMI. However, it is inconclusive with this study about how these MRI measures relate to cognitive decline in SMI patients. There have been few studies about relationships between MRI measures and cognitive decline in individuals with SMI. It has been reported that AD-like GM pattern in individuals with SMI or DTI measures in SMI and MCI patients was associated with cognitive decline (Selnes et al., 2013;Peter et al., 2014). More longitudinal studies are needed in a larger population to determine how baseline MRI measures relate to future cognitive decline in SMI.\nIn addition, regarding the DTI indices of MTL structures examined in current study, hippocampal body FA showed superior classification accuracy, compared with entorhinal WM FA, despite the absence of significant hippocampal volume differences between individuals with SMI and elderly controls. This finding may be related to the complex architecture of the entorhinal WM ROI. The entorhinal WM region includes the perforant pathway, which relays multimodal sensory information from the entorhinal cortex to the hippomcampus (Van Hoesen, 1995). The perforant pathway is the largest cortical association pathway in the temporal lobe, and partial volume effects resulting from crossing fibers are thought to be common (Solodkin et al., 2013). Therefore, DTI metrics may not be able to capture DTI changes in the entorhinal WM ROI, due to the complex composition of the entorhinal WM region compared with the hippocampal region.\nThe current study has several limitations that should be considered. This was a crosssectional study with a relatively small sample size. In addition, SMI is a heterogeneous condition observed in a wide range of situations, from normal aging to AD-spectrum disorder (Jessen et al., 2014). The lack of biomarker information for the underlying pathology of SMI, such as CSF or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers, represents another limitation of the current study. In future, larger, longitudinal studies with biomarkers of AD-type pathology will be important to confirm these results and determine their long-term clinical significance.",

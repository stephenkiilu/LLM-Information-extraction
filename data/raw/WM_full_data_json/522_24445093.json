    "abstract": "Background: Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is a subtype of dementia associated with abnormalities in the subcortical white matter regions. Recent imaging techniques can be used to detect such abnormalities in vivo. Purpose: To examine morphological changes of the corpus callosum in patients with SIVD by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Material and Methods: MRI was performed to explore changes of cerebral white matter, especially corpus callosum. Brain matter diffusivity was examined with DTI by measuring the fractional anisotropy (FA). Results of 30 patients diagnosed with SIVD and 30 healthy subjects were analyzed and compared. Results: The thicknesses of the genu, the anterior third, middle, and posterior third of the body, and the splenium of the corpus callosum were smaller in SIVD patients compared to healthy controls (0.54 AE 0.08 vs. 0.68 AE 0.09 cm, P ¼ 0.0011; 0.27 AE 0.06 vs. 0.38 AE 0.07 cm, P ¼ 0.002; 0.28 AE 0.05 vs. 0.38 AE 0.08 cm, P ¼ 0.009; 0.18 AE 0.04 vs. 0.26 AE 0.06 cm, P ¼ 0.013; 0.54 AE 0.07 vs. 0.72 AE 0.09 cm, P ¼ 0.003, respectively). The FA values of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum in patients with SIVD were decreased compared to healthy controls (0.664 AE 0.042 vs. 0.778 AE 0.041, P  0.001; 0.691 AE 0.038 vs. 0.786 AE 0.039, P ¼ 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with SIVD exhibit corpus callosum atrophy and morphological changes, and these characteristics may be useful for diagnosis.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "As the second most common type of dementia, vascular dementia (VD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of cognitive impairments caused by various cerebrovascular lesions. Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is a subtype of dementia that accounts for 36-67 of all cases of VD (1). SIVD originates from ischemic microvascular diseases in the brain (2)(3)(4)(5). Clinical features of SIVD include: (i) acute sensorymovement disorder caused by lacunar infarction; and (ii) cognitive impairment, personality change, emotional changes, gait disturbance, and movement disorder in the sub-acute stage. Cognitive disorders of SIVD mainly present as executive dysfunctions caused by frontal lobe dysfunctions, rather than severe dementia syndrome. Other cortical functions, such as language and calculation, are preserved. The ischemic changes manifest as high signal intensities in white matter on T2-weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical impact of white matter ischemia in patients with SIVD has been well studied (6)(7)(8)(9).\nAlthough a definitive diagnosis of dementia requires autopsy (10), recent advances in neuroimaging have enabled the earlier diagnosis of various types of dementia. SIVD is associated with abnormalities in the subcortical white matter regions, which can be detected by MRI (11). Recent MRI technologies have enabled the assessment of the white matter integrity in vivo. For example, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a functional MRI approach that can be used to examine the microstructural integrity of the white matter (12,13). The fractional anisotropy (FA) parameter quantitatively reflects the directional averaged diffusion. Patients with dementia reportedly show microscopic changes in their white matter by DTI (14,15).\nThe corpus callosum is an important myelinated axonal relay that connects the cortical-cortical and cortical-subcortical areas between two cerebral hemispheres. The aim of this study was to identify morphological changes of different regions of the corpus callosum in patients with SIVD by using combined DTI with conventional MRI sequences.",

      "text": "The postprocessing of the DTI data was performed on a GE workstation (FuncTool, Advantage Workstation 4.2, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The EPI distortion was automatically corrected by scaling, shearing, and translating each image to align it with the reference image (b ¼ 0). The goal of this process was to minimize the mismatch between the diffusion and reference images.\nThe FA images were computed and displayed together with the reference image. The FA was measured at different locations of the corpus callosum through a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis. The rater placed ROIs (size, 28-32 mm 2 ) at the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 2). The ROIs were selected from images acquired without diffusion gradients (b ¼ 0 smm 2 ). Each subjects ROIs were transferred onto the FA images to avoid selection bias from different DTI parameters.\nTo eliminate the effects of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gray matter on the image, partial volume averaging from the CSF space or gray matter structure was reduced by placing an ovoid sphere in the center of the target white matter. The ROI size was gradually adjusted (8-12 pixels), to avoid reaching the CSF space or gray matter. In the case of the corpus callosum atrophy, the long axis of the ovoid sphere was aligned along with the direction of the fiber tract. A small, slender ROI (e.g. 2 Â 4 pixels) was created to avoid partial volume effects. This method takes advantage of ovoid spherical ROIs of variable sizes.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The results of the current study indicate that SIVD patients have significantly reduced corpus callosum size compared with healthy controls. This corpus callosum atrophy can be detected by MRI.\nCallosal changes due to the brain atrophy have been characterized in Alzheimers disease (AD) (16,17), multiple sclerosis (17), and Huntington disease (18). The corpus callosum is vulnerable to diffuse axonal injury and atrophy after brain traumas (19). Atrophy of the corpus callosum is also associated with AD (12), VD (20), and cognitive and motor deficits in the elderly (21). Thus, we hypothesized that the thickness of the corpus callosum in different sections measured by MRI may reflect the changes of the corpus callosum in SIVD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of callosal tissue loss in patients with SIVD. Our findings showed that the size of the corpus callosum, based on the thickness of its different regions, is reduced in patients with SIVD.\nRegarding differences in the corpus callosum size between SIVD patients and healthy controls, special attention should be paid to the quantitative morphological analysis of the mid-sagittal corpus callosum. The size and shape of this region show considerable interindividual variability. Gender may also influence the size of the corpus callosum (22). These confounders should be considered when interpreting the quantitative analyses of the corpus callosum.\nThe present study showed that the reduced thickness of the corpus callosum in patients with SIVD compared to healthy controls and the degree of atrophy were different in different sections, which indicates that the different regions of the corpus callosum are reduced unevenly and the morphology is changed in SIVD. Findings about the area in the corpus callosum of patients with VD have been controversial (23)(24)(25). Lyoo et al. reported different patterns of regional corpus callosum area loss in subjects with AD and multi-infarct dementia (25). Pantel et al. investigated atrophic alterations in different regions of the corpus callosum in AD and VD with respect to clinical changes, and found that the total callosal size was significantly reduced in AD but not in VD. Furthermore, the most rostral regions of the corpus callosum were significantly smaller in AD when compared to controls. Again, these changes were not found in patients with VD (23).\nAnother finding of the present study was that the FA values in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum of SIVD patients are reduced significantly compared with healthy controls. Thus, the DTI sequence may aid in the detection of SIVD. The reduced FA value on DTI indicates that corpus callosum atrophy in AD may be caused by an interhemispheric disconnection, namely Wallerian degeneration of interhemispheric commissural nerve fibers originating from pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, which has been verified by neuroimaging studies. Tomimoto et al. found that the corpus callosum atrophy is correlated with the brain atrophy in AD, which is relevant to the mechanism of interhemispheric disconnection, while focal ischemic injuries cannot be ruled out (20).\nOur study has some limitations. A relatively small number of patients were included in the study. Aging and gender may affect the morphological change of the corpus callosum, but their possible effects were not addressed because of the small sample size. We used a cross-sectional approach to compare the size and FA values between patients with SIVD and healthy controls; however, this method does not take into account the effect of age and its relationship with imaging under different grading conditions. To explore the role of the corpus callosum in SIVD, additional prospective studies enrolling more subjects should be performed.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated the atrophy and morphological changes of the corpus callosum in SIVD. These findings suggest that neuroimaging may be helpful for detecting SIVD.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to study microstructural white matter alterations in a variety of conditions including normal aging and Alzheimers disease (AD). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are common in cognitively healthy elderly as well as in AD and exhibit elevated mean diffusivity (MD) and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA). However, the effect of WMH on statistical analysis of DTI estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In the present study we address this in two ways. First, we investigate the effect of WMH on MD and FA in the dorsal and ventral cingulum, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the corticospinal tract, by comparing two matched groups of cognitively healthy elderly (n  21  21) with unequal WMH load. Second, we assess the effects of adjusting for WMH load when comparing MD and FA in prodromal AD subjects (n  83) to cognitively healthy elderly (n  132) in the abovementioned white matter tracts. Results showed the WMH in cognitively healthy elderly to have a generally large effect on DTI estimates (Cohens d  0.63 to 1.27 for significant differences in MD and -1.06 to -0.69 for FA). These effect sizes were comparable to those of various neurological and psychiatric diseases (Cohens d  0.57 to 2.20 for differences in MD and -1.76 to -0.61 for FA). Adjusting for WMH when comparing DTI estimates in prodromal AD subjects to cognitively healthy elderly improved the explanatory power as well as the outcome of the analysis, indicating that some of the differences in MD and FA were largely driven by unequal WMH load between the groups rather than alterations in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Thus, our findings suggest that if the purpose of a study is to compare alterations in NAWM between two groups using DTI it may be necessary to adjust the statistical analysis for WMH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diffusion-weighted MRI is a non-invasive technique capable of detecting microstructural tissue alterations such as axonal loss and demyelination in the human brain in vivo 123. As such, its popularity has been growing steadily during the last two decades. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields estimates of e.g. the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA), and has been used to study human brain development and normal aging as well as a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions 45678.\nWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are, compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), visualized as hyperintense regions in the white matter on T2-weighted MRI and are most commonly thought to be due to small vessel disease 91011. They are typically located in periventricular or deep cortical regions and are histopathologically characterized by ischemic changes and a varying degree of gliosis, axonal loss, and demyelination. WMH are interchangeably called white matter lesions, white matter changes, and leukoaraiosis amongst others 111213. These changes are relatively common in cognitively healthy elderly with the prevalence varying substantially between different studies 141516. Some studies report that more than 90 of individuals older than 60 years exhibit WMH 17.\nDTI is sensitive to WMH, exhibiting elevated MD and reduced FA in affected white matter regions 181920. However, the relationship between alterations in NAWM, detectable only with DTI, and WMH, also detectable with T2-weighted MRI, has only recently been investigated more thoroughly 21,22. It has been proposed that WMH constitute a histopathological continuum of varying degree of white matter pathology 23. Several recent studies have also investigated the effect of WMH on DTI estimates in normal aging and concluded that WMH only partially explain the elevated MD and reduced FA seen in normal aging, suggesting that alterations in NAWM as quantified with DTI may represent an early phase and WMH the late phase of the same common pathophysiological phenomenon 24,25.\nGiven that WMH are seen in normal aging, it is reasonable to suspect that the mere presence of WMH in cognitively healthy elderly are associated to elevated MD and reduced FA. Two recent studies investigated this and observed that subjects having WMH were more likely to have elevated MD and reduced FA in general compared to healthy subjects not having WMH 26,27.\nDue to the association between DTI estimates and the presence of WMH, unequal WMH load between two groups may confound group comparisons, and lead to differences being partially due to the difference in WMH load rather than more disease-specific effects of alterations in NAWM. However, this methodological issue is not always considered and accounted for in DTI research, and the magnitude of the effect of WMH on DTI estimates in healthy subjects has not yet been fully investigated. The two above referenced studies included only a small number of subjects with WMH (n  12 and n  8, respectively) 26,27. Also, most of the subjects were in the fourth to fifth decades of life, wherefore it is uncertain to what degree the results apply to subjects in the sixth to eight decades of life, which are known to have a higher prevalence of WMH. Moreover, to our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated how the level of WMH load in a control group affects the comparison of DTI estimates to a diseased group.\nAmnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is characterized by cognitive impairment greater than expected for a particular age and educational level, but not significant enough to interfere with activities of daily life or fulfilling the criteria for dementia 28. Although aMCI is etiologically a heterogeneous entity, in a majority of cases aMCI is an expression of prodromal Alzheimers disease (AD) and it has been shown that the ratio between Aβ 42 and Aβ 40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) predicts conversion to AD rather well 29. aMCI and AD are both associated with alterations in NAWM that are thought to be disease-specific, as quantified with DTI, but they are also associated with elevated levels of WMH 5,30. Thus, it is possible that including controls with high WMH load in a study of prodromal AD subjects versus cognitively healthy elderly may lead to improper conclusions about disease-specific alterations in NAWM detectable only with DTI in the prodromal AD group. That is, inclusion of controls with high WMH load may lead to false negative results. On the other hand, inclusion of controls with low WMH load in a study of prodromal AD subjects with high WMH load may lead to an overestimation of disease-specific alterations in NAWM.\nWe therefore hypothesized that WMH can affect the results of a statistical analysis in DTI when there is a difference in WMH load between the investigated groups. The aim of this study was thus to, first, study the effect of unequal WMH load between two matched groups of cognitively healthy elderly on DTI estimates in several major white matter tracts and, second, to assess the effect of WMH when comparing prodromal AD subjects to cognitively healthy elderly. This aim was addressed in two ways. First, we compared MD and FA in the right and left dorsal and ventral cingulum, the right and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and the right and left corticospinal tract (CST) in cognitively healthy elderly with different levels of WMH load and estimated the effect size of WMH on DTI estimates. Second, we compared MD and FA in the abovementioned white matter tracts between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly in two analyses, unadjusted and adjusted for WMH, respectively. The abovementioned tracts were selected because the dorsal and ventral cingulum and the SLF, but not the CST, is associated with elevated MD and reduced FA in AD subjects, and the dorsal cingulum and the SLF, but not the ventral cingulum and the CST, are at least partially located in areas were WMH are common 5,17,30,31. This selection thereby allowed us to more carefully disentangle the effect of unequal WMH load between groups on DTI estimates from more disease-specific alterations in NAWM in prodromal AD.",

      "text": "Data acquisition was performed on a Siemens Trio 3 T MRI scanner using a standard 12-channel head coil. DTI data were acquired using a single-shot EPI sequence (TRTE  820086 ms ms) with diffusion encoding in 64 directions using b values of 0 and 1000 smm 2 . In total, 60 contiguous axial slices with a spatial resolution of 222 mm 3 were acquired. For the assessment of WMH load, 27 axial slices of T2-weighted FLAIR imaging were acquired (TRTE TI  9000892500 msmsms) at a spatial resolution of 0.70.75.2 mm 3 . The volumetric analysis was based on a coronal MPRAGE sequence (TRTETI  19503.37900 msmsms), with a spatial resolution of 1.01.01.2 mm 3 and a flip angle of 9.\nAll DTI data were corrected for motion and eddy current induced artifacts by registering images to the first non-diffusion weighted image using Elastix 35,36. Parameter maps of MD and FA were calculated from the diffusion tensor eigenvalues using in-house developed software implemented in Matlab (MATLAB 2013a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). This software fitted the diffusion tensor using heteroscedasticity-corrected linear least squares regression. DTI volumes were registered to MNI152 standard-space using the registration algorithm of FLIRT and FNIRT, parts of the FMRIB Software Library 37,38.\nSubjects that exhibited gross motion artifacts on DTI parameter maps or incidental findings such as meningioma, severe atrophy or old infarction were excluded from subsequent analysis.",

    "Tractography": {
      "text": "The investigated white matter tracts were generated using a semi-automated tractography method (Fig 1). The method utilized multiple regions of interest (ROIs) defined in MNI152 standard-space and warped to native-space using FNIRT results. The ROIs were then used to segment streamlines from a whole-brain tractography generated in TrackVis (thresholds were set to 0.2 for FA and 30for the angle) 39. This method was chosen over manual ROI definition in native-space, which would have required an inordinate analysis time due to the high number of subjects and white matter tracts. To include streamlines running along the whole white matter tract, as well as shorter streamlines in the same anatomical region, an AND-ROI covering the entire white matter tract was defined for each of the eight tracts in MNI152 standard-space, according to the ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels atlas 40. That is, the volume of the entire tract, as defined in the atlas, was projected from the atlas to standard-space and further to subject-space for each subject. To exclude streamlines from nearby white matter tracts intersecting the desired tract, a NOT-ROI was defined around their anatomical region of the tract according to the JHU WM tractography atlas 41. Technically, the same procedure for creating the AND-ROIs was used to create the NOT-ROIs, except that before the ROIs were projected to subject-space they were automatically enlarged by approximately five voxels from the border of the ROI. Then the actual tract volume was subtracted resulting in a shell-like ROI, with a thickness that corresponded to the enlargement of the original ROI, that surrounded the tract volume as defined in the atlas. The procedure was performed using in-house developed software implemented in Matlab, utilizing the warp-fields generated by FNIRT to warp ROIs from standard-space to subject-space, and TrackVis for streamline management. For each subject, the segmented white matter tracts were visually inspected and, if necessary, adjusted in subject-space. This semi-automated method was found to be more robust because automated delineation of the ROIs was less biased by inter-and intra-individual anatomical variation or different position of the head in the MRI scanner than manual placement of ROIs 42. The average value of MD and FA for each white matter tract was used in subsequent analysis.",

      "text": "Table 3 shows results from using regression model 1, where the dependent variable was MD or FA for each of the eight investigated tracts and the independent variables were having prodromal AD or not and ventricle volume. Tests showed that standardized β for having prodromal AD was significant for both MD and FA in the right SLF (β  0.19 for MD and β  -0.13 for FA), the left SLF (β  0.20 for MD and β  -0.16 for FA), the right dorsal cingulum (β  0.16 for MD and β  -0.23 for FA), the left dorsal cingulum (β  0.15 for MD and β  -0.20 for FA), the right ventral cingulum (β  0.23 for MD and β  -0.18 for FA), and the left ventral cingulum (β  0.27 for MD and β  -0.24 for FA). R 2 ranged from 0.02 to 0.09. Thus, prodromal AD subjects had elevated MD and reduced FA in the right and left SLF and in the right and left dorsal and ventral cingulum compared to cognitively healthy elderly in the analysis not adjusted for WMH volume.\nIn regression model 2 (see Table 3), where WMH volume was added as an additional independent variable, standardized β for having prodromal AD was significant for both MD and FA in the right ventral cingulum (β  0.23 for MD and β  -0.18 for FA), the left ventral cingulum (β  0.24 for MD and β  -0.21 for FA), and for FA in the right dorsal cingulum (β  -0.16) and left ventral cingulum (β  -0.16).

Furthermore, in model 2, standardized β for having prodromal AD was no longer significant for MD or FA in neither the right nor the left SLF and no longer significant for MD in neither the right nor the left dorsal cingulum.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, we set out to investigate if unequal WMH load affects the comparison of DTI estimates between groups. First, we studied the effect of WMH in several major white matter tracts in cognitively healthy elderly. Second, we assessed the effect of WMH when comparing prodromal AD subjects to cognitively healthy elderly. We observed that the effect of WMH on MD and FA were in general large (Table 2). Moreover, when comparing MD and FA between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly, we observed that adjusting the analysis for WMH load improved the explanatory power as well as the outcome of the analysis. Our interpretation is that the effect of WMH on DTI estimates is comparable to that of and sometimes larger than disease-specific alterations in NAWM as reported by previous studies and that differences in DTI estimates were in some white matter tracts largely attributed to WMH load rather than being specific to prodromal AD (Table 3). These results are important because they suggest that unequal WMH load between two investigated groups could affect the result of a comparison of DTI estimates and may thus lead to an over-or underestimation of disease-specific alterations in NAWM. For example, a high WMH load in a control group may lead to false negative results. On the other hand, a high WMH load in a diseased group, in e.g. prodromal AD, may lead to false positive results. That is, if the aim of the study was to study disease-specific alterations in NAWM rather than WMH. DTI estimates are affected by alterations in NAWM but also by WMH probably due to their similar composition on a microscopic level. Compared to normal white matter that largely consists of densely packed axons that restrict the diffusion of water molecules, alterations in NAWM are thought to represent axonal loss and demyelination leading to less restricted diffusion 51. WMH, on the other hand, are thought to have a microstructure that consists of a varying degree of gliosis but also more severe axonal loss and demyelination that also leads to less restricted diffusion measured as elevated MD and reduced FA 11121318. Early alterations in NAWM, detectable only with DTI, are thought to be more disease-specific whereas WMH, detectable with DTI and T2-weigted MRI, are also encountered in cognitively healthy elderly 4567814151617.\nWe found that the effect of WMH on MD and FA in cognitively healthy elderly was large and comparable to what has been reported previously for various pathological conditions. For example, effect sizes for MD in MCI are between 0.57 and 1.09, in AD between 0.95 and 1.04, in Parkinsons disease between 0.78 and 2.20, and in schizophrenia between 0.78 and 1.24 52 -57. Although the effect size is dependent on factors such as the cohort selection, the MRI scanner, the protocol used, and the method of analysis 58, it is worth noting that the significant effects we found on MD of high WMH load in matched subgroups of cognitively healthy In model 1, the dependent variable was MD or FA for each tract (the dorsal and ventral cingulum, the SLF, and the CST) and the independent variable were having prodromal AD or not. In model 2, WMH volume was added as an additional independent variable. Only standardized β for having aMCI or not and WMH volume are reported here. Results indicate that some of the differences in MD and FA between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly were largely driven by unequal WMH load between the groups rather than disease-specific alterations NAWM). elderly was between 0.63 and 1.27 for different tracts (Table 2). This is on par with several different pathological conditions (Table 4). Corresponding results were observed for FA. Adjusting for potentially unequal levels of WMH is thus warranted to disentangle effects of the WMH from more disease-specific alterations in NAWM.\nThe present study showed WMH to have a relatively large effect on DTI estimates even though we only took the WMH load into account, and not their exact location. This was probably due to a local effect of WMH on DTI estimates, large enough to affect the mean value of the white matter tract. The largest effect sizes were observed in the SLF and the dorsal cingulum, which are both at least partially located in regions where WMH are commonly observed (i.e. in periventricular and deep cortical regions) 5,17,30,31. This suggests that there is a correlation between the effect of WMH on DTI estimates in a specific tract and its local WMH load. However, the current study was not designed to study this correlation and is therefore not able to neither confirm nor discard it.\nWhen comparing DTI estimates in the eight investigated white matter tracts between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly using regression analysis we observed that MD was elevated and FA reduced, respectively, in prodromal AD subjects in the right and left dorsal and ventral cingulum and in the right and left SLF when the analysis was unadjusted for WMH load. These results are in accordance with most previous work although it has also been reported that FA can be unexpectedly elevated in the SLF of aMCI subjects due to a reduction of crossing fibers 5,59.\nAdjusting for WMH load allowed us to separately test the effects of disease-specific alterations in NAWM and WMH in prodromal AD. When adjusting the analysis for WMH load we observed that the explanatory power as well as the outcome was improved for investigated white matter tracts at least partially located in regions where WMH are common (e.g. the SLF and the dorsal cingulum in the deep cortical regions of the frontal and parietal lobes) but not in regions were WMH are less common (e.g. the ventral cingulum in the temporal lobe) 17,30,31. Furthermore, when adjusting the analysis for WMH load we still observed an elevated MD in the ventral cingulum and a reduced FA in the dorsal and ventral cingulum in prodromal AD subjects but no significant differences in MD in the SLF and dorsal cingulum or in FA in the SLF. This suggests that differences in DTI estimates in the SLF and partially in the dorsal cingulum between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly in the analysis unadjusted for WMH were largely driven by differences in WMH load between the two groups rather than disease-specific alterations in NAWM (Tables 1 and3). This is not that surprising given that there was a group mean difference in WMH load between the prodromal AD subjects and the cognitively healthy elderly and that the largest effect size in group mean difference between the matched subgroups of cognitively healthy elderly with unequal WMH load were seen in the SLF and the dorsal cingulum. It is possible that these results extrapolate to studies of other conditions, and in particular in the elderly since the prevalence of WMH is known to increase with age 141516.\nWe identified three limitations of the present study. First, the exact etiology of WMH in the study population was unknown. Even though we matched and adjusted the analyses for the influence of cardiovascular disease, WMH could in some subjects be an expression of other incipient disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis) that DTI could be sensitive to. However, we made an effort to minimize this potential confounding effect when designing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Second, since WMH have a different microscopic structure compared to NAWM, WMH may interfere with fiber tracking and thus the presence of WMH in the investigated groups may potentially have biased the results. Even though this is a theoretical limitation, visual inspection of the generated tractographies awoke no suspicions that this was the case in this study. Third, we did not correct for multiple comparisons due to the explorative nature of the study. This means that we preferred the risk of accepting false positive differences over the risk of discarding true positive differences.",

      "text": "The effect of unequal WMH load in cognitively healthy elderly on the DTI estimates MD and FA was generally large and comparable to previous reports from using DTI in various pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disease. Adjusting the statistical analysis for WMH load when comparing MD and FA between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly improved the explanatory power as well as the outcome of the analysis indicating that some differences in MD and FA were largely driven by unequal WMH load between the groups rather than disease-specific alterations in NAWM. This suggests that the effect of differences in WMH load between groups is large enough to affect the results of a statistical analysis of DTI estimates and that this should be taken into consideration in the design and interpretation of DTI studies. If the purpose of a DTI study is to compare disease-specific alterations in NAWM rather than WMH between groups with unequal WMH load this can be achieved by adjusting the statistical analysis for WMH load.",

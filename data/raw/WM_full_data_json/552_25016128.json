    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reflect accumulating pathology and have clinically disabling consequences, such as dementia. However, little is known on the relation of these MRI markers with daily functioning in nondemented individuals. We investigated whether structural and microstructural brain changes are associated with impairment in activities of daily living in a communitydwelling population. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2009, 2025 stroke-free nondemented participants (aged 59.9 years) from the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent brain MRI, yielding global MRI markers, focal MRI markers, and microstructural MRI markers. We used the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire to assess basic activities of daily living, and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale to assess instrumental activities of daily living. Follow-up on activities of daily living was obtained between 2008 and 2013 (mean follow-up 5.7 years). We used linear regression to analyze continuous scores of daily living and logistic regression for incident impairment. RESULTS: Eighty-two participants became impaired in basic and 33 in instrumental activities of daily living. Smaller brain and hippocampal volume and higher diffusivity were associated with larger change in activities of daily living. Smaller brain volume (odds ratio OR 4.05 per SD; 95 confidence interval CI, 1.81e9.02), larger white matter lesion volume (OR 1.33SD; 95 CI 1.02e1.72) and higher mean (OR 1.55SD; 95 CI, 1.11e2.15), axial (OR 1.49SD; 95 CI, 1.08e2.07), and radial diffusivity (OR 1.51 SD; 95 CI, 1.09-2.10) were associated with higher risk of impairment in basic activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling individuals, brain changes are associated with deterioration and incident impairment in daily functioning.",

      "text": "this co-occurrence, it is primarily deterioration in daily functioning, rather than cognition, that leads to loss of independence and institutionalization. Therefore, unraveling determinants of daily functioning is important to understand processes leading toward loss of independence.\nStructural brain changes, as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are strong determinants of cognitive impairment, even in nondemented subjects. 6,7 Recently, microstructural integrity of white matter, which is invisible on conventional MRI but can be quantified on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has also been shown to be associated with cognition. 8,9 Although the role of structural and microstructural brain changes in cognitive impairment is clear, little is known on their relation with daily functioning.\nGenerally, daily functioning is assessed by activities of daily living, including physical basic activities, such as eating, and more cognitive instrumental activities, such as meal preparation. 10 Previous studies investigating brain changes in relation to activities of daily living were mainly clinic based. 3,111213 Yet, public health impact is best evaluated in a community-dwelling population. Additionally, these studies rated structural brain changes visually, while automated quantification may disentangle more subtle associations. 3,111213 Furthermore, study of microstructure may show whether brain pathology invisible on conventional MRI leads to deterioration in daily functioning.\nWe investigated whether structural and microstructural brain changes are associated with deterioration in basic and instrumental activities of daily living in nondemented community-dwelling individuals.",

      "text": "The study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. 14 In 1990 and 2000, all inhabitants of Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam, aged 55 years and older were invited to participate. In 2006, the cohort was extended, inviting all inhabitants aged 45 years and older. Every 3-4 years, participants are re-invited for follow-up examinations. At baseline and follow-up visits, participants undergo an interview, including activities of daily living questionnaires, and medical examinations. Follow-up assessment of daily functioning was performed between December 2008 and August 2013. Eighty-eight participants died before follow-up. Of the remaining participants, 2229 were re-invited, of whom 160 refused to participate, 21 did not respond, 11 were unable to participate, 9 had missing follow-up data, and 3 had moved out of the study area. Finally, we included 2025 participants in the analyses.\nOur DTI protocol was implemented only in MRI scans of participants from the third sub-cohort (n ¼ 1283).",

    "CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE": {
      "text": "In nondemented community-dwelling individuals, structural and microstructural brain changes are associated with deterioration and higher risk of impairment in a wide range of daily activities. These associations were strongest for brain atrophy. Microstructural brain changes provide additional information above structural brain changes in predicting who will deteriorate in daily functioning. Brain changes may provide a valid intervention target to prevent future impairment in daily functioning.\nAfter affine registrations to T1 images to adjust for subject motion and eddy currents, DTI images were resampled at an isotropic resolution of 1 mm 3 , and a Levenberg-Marquard nonlinear least-squares estimator was used to fit diffusion tensors. 21,22 These were then used to derive fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity images. 23,24 The diffusion images were combined with tissue segmentations to obtain measurements in the normal-appearing white matter. Lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity indicate poorer white matter integrity.\nGlobal MRI markers of atrophy comprise brain, gray matter, total white matter, and hippocampal volume. Focal MRI markers comprise white matter lesion volume, lacunar infarcts, and microbleeds. Microstructural MRI markers comprise fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity.

      "text": "Basic activities of daily living was assessed with the disability index from the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, consisting of 20 items constituting 8 components: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, grip, reach, and activities. 25 We combined 2 of 3 items of eating (ability to lift a glass of milk and ability to cut meat) into one. Items were scored from 0 to 3, as follows: 0 ¼ without difficulty, 1 ¼ with some difficulty, 2 ¼ with much difficulty, and 3 ¼ unable to. Component scores were calculated as the highest scored item per component. 25 Hence, items scored as nonapplicable or missing were accounted for by properly scored items in their respective components. The basic activities of daily living score was then calculated by summing all components, obtaining a score between 0 and 24. We considered scores from 0 to 8 as no to mild disability and from 8 to 24 as moderate to very severe disability. 26",

    "Statistical Analysis": {
      "text": "White matter lesion volumes were natural log-transformed to obtain a normal distribution. Continuous MRI markers were Z-standardized (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation).\nAssociations of MRI markers with cross-sectional functioning and change in basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living were investigated in 2 ways.\nFirst, we used basic and instrumental activities of daily living as continuous outcomes, with change analyzed as the score at follow-up, adjusted for baseline score. 31 Linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations of MRI markers with basic and instrumental activities, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.\nSecond, basic and instrumental activities of daily living scores were dichotomized at a score of 8. Subjects with scores between 0 and 8 were considered unimpaired, and subjects with scores from 8 to 24 impaired. Incident impairment in activities of daily living was defined as the transition from being unimpaired at baseline to impaired at follow-up. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to model associations of global, focal, and microstructural MRI markers with prevalent and incident impairment in basic and instrumental activities. Participants who were already impaired at baseline were not included in analyses of incident impairment.\nAnalyses were adjusted for age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure-lowering medication use, current or past smoking, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein. Global MRI markers (except brain volume) were included in one model to investigate independent associations. Similarly, focal MRI markers were included in one model. Analyses of global and focal MRI markers were adjusted for intracranial volume and subcohort. Analyses of microstructural MRI markers were adjusted for total white matter volume and white matter lesion volume. Longitudinal analyses were adjusted for time between visits.\nTo adjust for multiple testing, we used separate Bonferroni thresholds for global, focal, and microstructural MRI markers to take into account correlations among these markers: 6 tests (P corrected  .008) for global MRI markers (3 independent determinants: gray matter, white matter, and hippocampus and 2 outcomes: basic and instrumental activities of daily living), 6 tests (P corrected  .008) for focal MRI markers (3 determinants and 2 outcomes), and 4 tests (P corrected  .012) for microstructural MRI markers (2 determinants: fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity consisting of axial and radial diffusivity and 2 outcomes).\nIn sensitivity analyses, we repeated analyses for incident impairment with additional adjustment for baseline scores.\nAnalyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 21.0.0.1 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY).",

    "RESULTS": {
      "text": "Mean age at baseline was 59.9 years (SD 7.0), and 54.7 of participants were women (Table 1).

Average follow-up time was 5.7 (SD 0.6) years and average change was 0.88 points (SD 2.47) in basic and 0.24 (SD 2.25) in instrumental activities of daily living.

Of 1982 participants without baseline instrumental activities of daily living impairment, 33 (1.7) became impaired.\nCross-sectional associations are presented in Supplementary Tables 1-3, available online.\nIn longitudinal analyses, smaller brain volume was associated with larger change in both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, driven by gray and white matter volume (Table 2). Smaller brain volume (odds ratio OR 4.05 per SD smaller volume; 95 confidence interval CI, 1.81-9.02), gray matter volume (OR 2.29; 95 CI, 1.30-4.04), and total white matter volume (OR 2.03; 95 CI, 1.22-3.39) also were associated with higher risk of incident impairment in basic activities. Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with larger change in instrumental activities.\nWe found no associations of focal MRI markers with change or impairment in either basic or instrumental activities, after Bonferroni correction (Table 3).\nHigher mean and radial diffusivity in brain white matter was associated with larger change in basic activities (Table 4).\nHigher mean diffusivity also was associated with higher risk of impairment in basic activities of daily living (OR 1.55; 95 CI, 1.11-2.15).\nIn sensitivity analyses, additional adjustment for baseline scores yielded similar results.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In nondemented community-dwelling individuals, we found that structural and microstructural brain changes are associated with deterioration and incident impairment in activities of daily living. Smaller brain volume was associated with larger deterioration in basic and instrumental activities, and higher risk of impairment in basic activities of daily living. Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with larger deterioration in instrumental activities, while white matter lesions were only nominally associated with higher risk of impairment in basic activities. Worse white matter microstructural integrity was associated with larger deterioration and incident impairment in basic activities of daily living.\nThe main novelty of our study is that we found structural and microstructural brain changes are associated with deterioration and incident impairment in activities of daily living in community-dwelling, stroke-free, and nondemented individuals. Previous studies were mainly clinic based, thereby including selected participants with possibly incipient dementia. 3,11,12,32 Our study now indicates that, even in relatively young and healthy nondemented individuals, brain pathology may lead to impairment in daily functioning. Interestingly, we found only weak cross-sectional associations, suggesting little impairment in daily functioning at baseline. In contrast, strong longitudinal associations emphasize the large impact brain pathology may have on public health, extending further than only subjects who seek medical help and have a high risk of incident dementia. Additionally, we found that brain pathology may affect both physical basic and cognitively more demanding instrumental activities. Together, our findings suggest that interventions aimed at preventing or reducing progression of brain pathology may prevent impairment in a wide range of daily activities. Because vascular risk factors and vascular pathology have an important role in accumulating brain pathology, these may be important targets for preventive interventions. Clinicians should be aware that treatment of vascular pathology should not only aim to prevent cardiovascular disease, but also brain pathology. Indeed, various studies have already indicated that treatment of hypertension may reduce progression of brain pathology. 33,34 Still, future studies should first investigate the feasibility of treatment of vascular risk factors to slow progression of brain pathology and subsequent impairment in daily functioning. Direct comparison of our findings with previous studies is limited. We used quantitative measurements to rate brain atrophy and white matter lesions, while previous studies graded these visually. Additionally, previous studies often used different questionnaires and rarely investigated activities of daily living continuously. Still, some remarks can be made.\nWe found that smaller brain volume, driven by both gray and white matter, is associated with larger deterioration in basic and instrumental activities. Additionally, we found that smaller brain volume is associated with higher risk of incident impairment in basic activities. These associations are supported by 2 studies showing that ventricular enlargement is associated with incident activities of daily living disability. 3,13 Importantly, we now find that one SD smaller brain volume is associated with a fourfold higher risk of incident basic activities of daily living impairment. In our dataset, this corresponds to the effect on basic activities of being 25 years older in age. This demonstrates the huge clinical impact brain pathology may have on daily functioning. Although we found similar associations of brain volume with deterioration in instrumental activities continuously, none were found with incident impairment in instrumental activities. This may be explained by smaller numbers leading to lower power. In line with another study, we found that smaller hippocampus volume is associated with deterioration in instrumental activities. 32 Hippocampus volume was not associated with change in basic activities, which underscores the main role of the hippocampus in cognition and less so in physical ability.\nWe did not find convincing associations of focal MRI markers with basic or instrumental activities. This may be explained by the focal nature of such pathology. In contrast, atrophy is diffuse and often affects large areas of the brain and is therefore more likely to affect brain regions important for activities of daily living. Also, diffuse continuous MRI markers have more statistical power than focal dichotomous MRI markers.\nOurs is the first study to demonstrate that microstructural white matter changes (ie, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity) are associated with deterioration and incident impairment in basic activities of daily living. Importantly, these associations were independent from total white matter and white matter lesion volume. These findings suggest that brain pathology invisible on conventional MRI provides additional information above volumetric measures in predicting who will deteriorate in daily functioning.\nStrengths of our study include the population-based design, investigation of various structural and microstructural brain changes, quantitative measurement of brain atrophy and white matter lesions, and longitudinal assessment of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living.\nA limitation is that follow-up MRI was unavailable. Therefore, we could not establish whether change in brain pathology coincided with change in activities of daily living. Another limitation is that participants may be relatively healthy, because they were required to participate in 2 interviews and an MRI examination. Therefore, generalization of our findings may be limited to a relatively healthy population.",

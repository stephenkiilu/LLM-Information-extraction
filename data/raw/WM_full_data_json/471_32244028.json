    "abstract": "With the increasing incidence of cerebrovascular diseases and dementia, considerable efforts have been made to develop effective treatments on vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), among which accumulating practice-based evidence has shown great potential of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Current randomized double-blind controlled trial has been designed to evaluate the 6-month treatment effects of Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsules, one TCM herbal preparations on VCI, and to explore the underlying neural mechanisms with graph theory-based analysis and machine learning method based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. A total of 82 VCI patients were recruited and randomly assigned to drug (45 with DZSM) and placebo (37 with placebo) groups, and neuropsychological and neuroimaging data were acquired at baseline and after 6-month treatment. After treatment, compared to the placebo group, the drug groups showed significantly improved performance in Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score (p  0.001) and the other cognitive domains. And with the reconstruction of white matter structural network, there were more streamlines connecting the left thalamus and right hippocampus in the drug groups (p  0.001 uncorrected), with decreasing nodal efficiency of the right olfactory associated with slower decline in the general cognition (r  -0.364, p  0.048). Moreover, support vector machine classification analyses revealed significant white matter network alterations after treatment in the drug groups (accuracy of baseline vs. 6-month later, 68.18 ). Taking together, the present study showed significant efficacy of DZSM treatment on VCI, which might result from white matter microstructure alterations and the topological changes in brain structural network.",

      "text": "With the aging of the global society, incidence of cerebrovascular diseases and dementia has been rapidly increasing. It is estimated that the total number of dementia patients will reach 152 million in 2050, and 25  of them will be Chinese 1. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is considered to be the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimers disease 2,3. And it not only has a huge impact on the life quality of patients, but also poses a heavy burden on families and society 4,5.\nVCI refers to a wide variety of medical conditions caused by cerebrovascular risk factors and cerebrovascular diseases, and it varies from mild cognitive impairment to dementia 3,6,7. The revision of the VCI definition 8 not only broadened the range, distinguished the degree of severity, and improved the consistency and standardization of the disease, but also revealed the practical implications of early prevention https:doi.org10.1016j.phrs.2020.104773 Received 7 January 2020; Received in revised form 18 March 2020; Accepted 20 March 2020 and intervention towards VCI risk factors. As VCI is drawing rapidly increasing attention because of its high prevalence and potential reversibility 9, the earliest stages of VCI are the critical periods for preventing or changing the course of cerebrovascular diseases, retarding the progress of VCI, and incorporating dementia drugs into a therapeutic plan.\nAt present, the primary treatment for VCI is prevention by treating vascular diseases and other risk factors linked to VCI 10. Although studies have suggested that patients with VCI can benefit from donepezil and other medications 11, there is still dispute over the intervention effects of those medications in clinical trials. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown effects with regard to the prevention and treatment of VCI 121314151617, and has been widely used in clinical practice and has demonstrated good curative effects 18,19. Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsule is a patented traditional Chinese medicine for the secondary prevention of stroke and its use is supported by evidence-based medicine. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 edition, DZSM are composed of four prepared slices of Chinese crude drugs: Erigerontis Herba (EH), Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma (GR), Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (SCF), and Ophiopogonis Radix (OR) 20. The assay indicators of DZSM are scutellarin and 4,5-DiCQA 20. Scutellarin is an herbal flavonoid glucuronide with multiple pharmacological activities and has multiple beneficial effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, vascular relaxation, anti-platelet, anti-coagulation, and myocardial protection 21. Scutellarin, through binding to Aβ42, efficiently inhibits oligomerization as well as fibril formation and reduces Aβ oligomer-induced neuronal toxicity in cell line SH-SY5Y, which has the beneficial effects on intervention on development or progression of AD-like neuropathology 22. DZSM protected against cognitive defects of AD through accelerating the scutellarin-mediated aggregation of Aβ into fibrils or protofibrils and reduction of soluble Aβ oligomers 23. There was a meta-analyse showing that DZSM capsule appeared to improve neurological function and quality of life based on conventional therapy for ischemic stroke and DZSM capsule seemed generally safe for clinical application 24. As the incidence of cognitive impairment-related diseases has increased, DZSM capsules have been widely used in the prevention of high-risk factors for dementia and the clinical treatment of cognitive impairment-related diseases in recent years.\nAt present, most of the evaluation methods regarding TCM in the treatment of VCI are neuropsychological tests, which are greatly influenced by education level. Recent work has suggested that the effects of vascular lesions on cognitive function were mediated through alterations in structural and functional connectivity 25. Further promotion and more extensive use of TCM are limited by the lack of objective evaluation methods examining their effects on improving cognitive injury. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance for the use of TCM in the prevention and treatment of VCI to identify scientific methods to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions.\nAdvanced neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can explore micro changes in white matter integrity and even the complex structural networks in patients with dementia or cognitive impairment 26,27, creating great opportunities for the discovery and efficacy evaluation of potential medications. Brain imaging could be incorporated in the design for any trial of VCI, with MRI being the complementary method for phase III studies 9. As neuroimaging provides in vivo evidence that VCI may be a disease of the brain network, graph theoretical analysis (GTA) using DTI data can facilitate examination of large-scale white matter (WM) connectivity of the human brain from a network perspective 28. With GTA quantifying the nature of network structures, recent results have shown that changes in network structures will explain the association between lesions of small vessel diseases observed on neuroimages and cognitive deficits 29,30.\nBy employing a dual outcome strategy (cognitive and brain global structural measures) 31, this double-blind placebo-controlled study aims to evaluate VCI patients changes in behaviors and brain white matter after 6 month intervention with DZSM capsules, and to explore the structural mechanisms of TCM on VCI by DTI-based network construction and GTA, along with neuropsychological tests. This study might not only be of significance for explanations on the pathological mechanisms of VCI, but also serve as a methodological reference for future researches on evaluating the curative effects of TCM.",

The DZSM capsule is a widely used compound Chinese medicine that was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2002, and the drugs used in this study were supplied by the sponsor and were provided to the participants at baseline. The components of the placebo were corn starch 80.57 , caramel pigment 19.34 , milk chocolate brown 0.04 , lemon yellow 0.03 , bitter agent 0.02 . The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to orally administer 2 capsules of DZSM or placebo, which were identical in appearance, three times daily for 6 months. All participants received a neuropsychological assessment and MRI scanning by professional imaging staff at baseline and after 6 months of treatment.\nTo ensure the quality of the cognitive tests, the investigators were trained before the study began. All the patients were from China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and were diagnosed as VCI by at least two neurologists, and another neurologist performed all the recheck.

We used inverse transformations to warp the AAL atlas from the MNI space to the DTI native space. After this step, we obtained 90 cortical and subcortical ROIs. Each ROI represented a distinct gray matter region and was considered as one network node. The threshold for the streamline was selected as 3 to define the edges of the binary network, which we considered that they were structurally connected when there were at least three fiber streamlines between two brain regions. The network edges were set to 1 as structurally connected and 0 for less than 3 streamlines. Therefore, a binary 90  90 WM structural network was constructed for each participant. And subsequent binary graph theory-based network analyses were performed in GRETNA (http: www.nitrc.orgprojectsgretna) 52. To characterize the topological organization of the WM structural networks, several key graph measures were calculated, including global efficiency (GloE), shortest path length (Lp), clustering coefficient (Cp), and small-world parameters (Gamma and Lambda) 53, as well as regional measures including nodal efficiency and nodal LocE for local efficiency 54,55.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study suggested that DZSM capsule treatment for 6 months was effective in improving cognitive status and increasing white matter connectivity and may have improved the degree of small-world attribute in patients with VCI. These results indicated that the drugs could treat VCI efficiently and showed the value of using neuroimaging techniques and machine learning analyses in clinical trials to assess biomarkers and to understand the underlying brain mechanisms.\nAfter 6 months of treatment, the drug group showed significant group and time interaction effects on the cognitive scores of the ADAS-cog, MMSE, AVLT, CDT, etc. The ADAS-Cog was able to measure impairments in multiple cognitive domains 56. The minimal clinically relevant change on the ADAS-Cog often used in clinical studies to define responders varied between 3 and 5 points, with a change of  4 being recommended by a consensus committee of the FDA 57. In this study, the ADAS-cog decreased by 4 points after treatment in DZSM group, indicating that the treatment was effective. The MMSE can be used as an effective tool for easily detecting the basic cognitive status of patients with high sensitivity 58,59. The AVLT, including the immediate memory, delayed memory and recognition tests, can comprehensively assess types of memory impairment 39. The CDT mainly reflected visuospatial function 60,61. The above results suggested that DZSM capsules could improve general cognitive function, episodic memory and visuospatial function of VCI patients. Our results suggested that ADAS-cog, MMSE, AVLT and CDT had been improved by 6 months of DZSM capsules treatment. The aggregation of Aβ can induce oxidative stress, inflammation and neurotoxicity, which further leading to cognitive dysfunction. Scutellarin, one of the Essential ingredients of DZSM capsules, has been reported to reduce the aggregation of Aβ 1,2. Therefore, we suspected that DZSM capsules may improve its general cognitive ability, situational memory and visual spatial ability by reducing the aggregation of Aβ.\nThis study found that the structural connections between the left thalamus and the right hippocampus in the drug group were strengthened after the intervention, and the white matter fiber bundle may have been located in the callosum (P  0.001, uncorrected) 62. The thalamus, as a location for strategic infarcts in vascular dementia, is involved in cognition 63. With its dense cortical and subcortical connections, the thalamus is a vital subcortical region that supports cognitive functions that are known to be reduced in VCI, including executiveattention functions and memory, among others 64. Lesions in the thalamus not only affect declarative memory but also interfere with nondeclarative motor skill learning 65. The hippocampus has extensive connections with the cerebral cortex and is involved in memory. Li et al. suggested that increased GABAergic neurotransmission and reduced activity of extracellular regulated protein kinase existed in the bilateral hippocampi and thus contributed to cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke 66. The brain connectivity network was progressively disrupted as cognitive impairment worsened, with an increased number of decreased connections between brain regions 67. In this study, the placebo group showed more decreased structural connectivity than the drug group, and no enhanced white matter connectivity was observed at 6 months of follow-up.\nBoth the drug and placebo groups demonstrated small-world architectures (GammaLambda 1) in our study. Large-scale networks could reveal attributes that accommodate and promote the segregation and integration of neural information 68. The small-world properties, which represented the network information transmission efficiency, are were usually disrupted in many neuropsychological diseases 69,70, including vascular diseases 71,72. Our results found that the drug group showed an increased trend in small-worldness after treatment, which may suggest an improvement in network efficiency. Graph theoretical methods recently provided valuable tools to explore the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of drugs on a more global level 73,74. To our best knowledge, this current study is one of the first ten researches to apply graph theory to evaluate the impact of TCM on structural neuronal networks.\nMany reports showed that the white matter network efficiency could be considered as the good index for the brain structure 75. Small vessel disease (SVD), which has extensive effects on the microstructures of the brain, is the most common and most homogeneous form of VCI 76. Measures of network disruption were associated with MRI markers of SVD and cognitive function 77. Network efficiency was found to mediate the effects of SVD-related MRI lesions on cognitive function 78. Global network efficiency is sensitive to the cumulative effect of multiple manifestations of SVD on brain connectivity and may therefore serve as a useful marker for functionally relevant disease progression in clinical trials 79. We found a significant group-by-time interaction in nodal efficiency, where the left olfactory cortex and cuneus in the drug group showed a downward trend and the placebo group showed no such trend after 6 months of treatment. Nodal efficiency expressed the importance of the nodes for information communication within the network. Lawrence and colleagues found that 85 out of 90 nodes showed significantly decreased nodal efficiency in SVD; there were 5 regions, including the bilateral olfactory cortex 80, that did not show this effect. Another study also found an increased nodal local efficiency in the olfactory cortex in SVD patients 72. Gong et al. found that 14 regions localized in the frontal and temporal cortex showed increased regional efficiency in aging, which may indicate a putative compensatory mechanism of the cortical network 81.\nIn our study, we found significant group  time interaction effects for the nodal efficiency of the left olfactory gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus, as well as for the nodal local efficiency of the right olfactory gyrus and left cuneus. We further investigated the relationships between the network measures and cognition, and the results suggested that the change in nodal efficiency in the right olfactory cortex in the drug group was significantly correlated with the improvements in MMSE scores. However, the placebo group showed no such correlation. The structure and function of the olfactory cortex are usually involved in the pathology of dementia 82. A previous study showed that the olfactory bulb and tract volume were significantly correlated with global cognitive performance in dementia 83. The correlation between behavioral performance and the white matter structural network indicated that the changes in the connectivity attributes of the olfactory cortex were correlated with the improvement in cognitive ability. Thus, we speculated that the DZSM capsule may play an important role in increasing network efficiency in some key brain regions.\nIn recent years, SVM has been successfully applied in the context of disease diagnosis, transition prediction and treatment prognosis, using both structural and functional neuroimaging data 84. In our study, we found the SVM classified the network matrix of the drug group at baseline vs. after treatment with an accuracy of 68.18 . However, this classification accuracy in the placebo group was only 48.15 , basically at the random level (50 ). These results clearly showed that the DZSM capsule had caused obvious, at least above the random level, brain structural network connectome changes. And more importantly, these kinds of change were accompanied by improvements in cognition, represented by significant reduction of ADAS-cog as well as increase of MMSE.\nThis study demonstrated the efficacy of DZSM capsules on VCI through the white matter structural network method, which was feasible and innovative. The strengths of the study lie in the combination of neuropsychological tests, MRI DTI technical network construction and GTA methods, which has not been used in past clinical trials assessing TCM treatment of VCI.\nNeuroimaging is critically important in the diagnosis and management of VCI 3. The use of MRI is a surrogate marker for small vessel disease, which was supported by natural history data that showed progression of these lesions 85. The structural network based on diffusion MRI data could more intuitively depict the authentic structural connections of encephalic regions. DTI is useful in the assessment of surrogates for microarchitectural integrity in normal-appearing and lesioned white matter, in the determination of structural connectivity of white matter, and in tractography 86. Structural brain imaging, especially MRI, remains the imaging method of choice for vivo assessment of cerebrovascular diseases 9.\nFor the past few years, substantial research on the prevention and treatment of VCI with TCM has been performed. DZSM capsules have received approval from the China Food and Drug Administration for treating apoplexy sequelae caused by deficiency of Qi and Yin and blood stasis in cerebrovascular diseases. Attempts to develop new treatments for cognitive impairment associated with VCI have been fraught with lengthy time requirements, expensive costs, and high failure rates. Repurposing older drugs to new indications might provide a lower-risk alternative 87. Chinese doctors treat VCI with DZSM capsules, which has good efficacy.\nIn the future, we can further extend this study in the following aspects. Our study has shown good efficacy within 6 months. An adequately designed study lasting for 1-3 years will be necessary to fully explore the symptomatic efficacy of DZSM capsules in this disorder as well as its efficacy in the prevention of VCI. In addition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction 88 and is initially compromised in VCID, leading to a chronic hypoxic state and hypoperfusion 89. Chronic hypoperfusion has long been implicated in VCI pathogenesis 90. In the future, we can further combine DTI and cerebral atrophy to comprehensively analyze the influence of vascular lesions on the distal connecting regions of the brain 91, assess perfusion alterations in patients with VCI by arterial spin labeling (ASL) 92, and quantify the permeability of the partial BBB of the human brain by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI 88,93.",

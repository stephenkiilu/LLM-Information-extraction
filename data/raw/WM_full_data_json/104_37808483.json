    "abstract": "Background: The progression of FLAIR white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI heralds vascular-mediated cognitive decline. Even before FLAIR WMH progression, adjacent normal appearing white matter (NAWM) already demonstrates microstructural deterioration on di usion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that elevated DTI free water (FW) would precede FLAIR WMH progression, implicating interstitial fluid accumulation as a key pathological step in the progression of cerebral small vessel disease. Methods: Participants at least months after an ischemic stroke or TIA with WMH on MRI underwent serial brain MRIs every months over the subsequent year. For each participant, the WMHs were automatically segmented, serial MRIs were aligned, and a region of WMH penumbra tissue at risk was defined by dilating lesions at any time point and subtracting baseline lesions. Penumbra voxels were classified as either stable or progressing to WMH if they were segmented as new lesions and demonstrated increasing FLAIR intensity over time. Aligned DTI images included FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA Tissue ) and mean di usivity (MD Tissue ). Logistic regression and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) were used to test whether baseline DTI predicted voxelwise classification of stable penumbra or progression to WMH while covarying for clinical risk factors. Results: In the included participants (n  , mean age  years,  female), we detected a median annual voxel-wise WMH growth of .  . ml. Each baseline DTI metric was associated with lesion progression in the penumbra, but FW had the greatest AUC of . ( . -. ) for predicting voxel-wise WMH progression pooled across participants. Discussion: Baseline increased interstitial fluid, estimated as FW on DTI, predicted the progression of NAWM to WMH over the following year. These results implicate the presence of FW in the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease progression.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions detected on FLAIR MRI are a hallmark of chronic cerebrovascular disease and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). WMHs are associated with risk for recurrent stroke, (1) cognitive decline, (2) and incident dementia (3). Progression of WMH is also associated with cognitive decline (2) and conversion to mild cognitive impairment or dementia (4). Progressive WMH accumulation implicates cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), although WMHs are also seen in other pathologies including Alzheimers disease. The pathophysiology of WMH progression is unclear but may be due to arteriolosclerosis, subclinical ischemia, endothelial damage with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, (5) vasogenic edema, (6) venous stasis or collagenosis, (7) demyelination, and axonal injury (8). Although there are no known therapies that directly affect the progression of WMH, a better understanding of the pathophysiological changes detected on imaging preceding progression could facilitate future therapeutic development.\nIn patients with stroke and chronic cerebrovascular disease, imaging has helped elucidate the changes leading to WMH progression. The normal appearing white matter (NAWM) immediately surrounding FLAIR WMH is termed the WMH penumbra and is at greatest risk for progression into overt FLAIR WMH lesions (9). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect impaired white matter integrity even in the NAWM, characterized by reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) (9). DTI measures the directional diffusion of water in tissue and is more sensitive to demyelination, axonal damage, or fluid shifts than conventional MRI. In the WMH penumbra, increased MD and reduced FA can be detected, extending far past the edge of visible WMH on FLAIR (9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14). In a longitudinal cohort study of elderly volunteers over 18 months, new WMH progression occurred mostly within 3 mm of the edge of periventricular WMH, with no new WMH voxels detected past 5 mm (15). Other longitudinal studies have found that alterations in MD and FA in the WMH penumbra predict the progression of NAWM into the new WMH (10,16,17).\nMore complex DTI models can further elucidate white matter microstructure by modeling distinct tissue compartments. DTI free water (FW) imaging models the diffusion signal as having two components: a fast, freely moving (isotropic) diffusion signal that reflects a CSF-like compartment and a slower, hindered diffusion signal that reflects tissue architecture (18). Within white matter, the isolated CSF-like signal is estimated as the FW fraction. The other component of the diffusion signal modeled is the tissue tensor compartment, which can provide FW-corrected measures of WM integrity: FA Tissue and MD Tissue . These FW-corrected measures of white matter integrity may more closely reflect the integrity of underlying white matter after removing the influence of free water and CSF partial volume effects. The estimated FW signal within white matter is also relevant to the underlying physiology since it is thought to reflect interstitial fluid. Increased DTI FW in white matter is closely associated with chronic cerebrovascular disease and VCID. FW measurements outperformed conventional imaging markers of cerebral SVD in predicting disability and processing speed in sporadic SVD and CADASIL patients (19). FW is also altered in the NAWM of the WMH penumbra, suggesting altered FW is an early precursor to WMH progression (20).\nIn this study of participants with prior ischemic stroke or TIA and evidence of early confluent WMH on MRI, we measured longitudinal changes in white matter FW and tested the hypothesis that increased FW is a predictor of NAWM progression to WMH remote from the infarct.",

      "text": "Chronic infarcts were manually segmented on baseline 3D FLAIR and T1 with reference to acute MRI when available to exclude them from the regions of interest (ROI) used for analysis. The FLAIR hyperintense regions surrounding infarcts were also excluded from white matter and lesion masks. T1, 3D FLAIR, and axial FLAIR were used to segment WMH, white matter, gray matter, and CSF for each time point using FreeSurferbased SAMSEG (Supplementary Methods) (22). Segmentations were visually inspected and manually corrected for accuracy and to exclude FLAIR hyperintensity associated with chronic infarcts. Lesions at any time point were combined across time, the summation mask was dilated by 3 mm, and then the baseline WMH was subtracted to create a WMH penumbra for both baseline and de novo lesions remote from chronic infarcts. The WMH penumbra is at greatest risk for WMH progression in SVD, so it provides an ideal region to study the imaging changes that precede new WMH development. A prior longitudinal analysis found that most new WMH progression occurred within 3 mm of the periventricular WMH edge, and none occurred past 5 mm over a median of 18 months (15). The remaining non-lesion, non-penumbra white matter comprised the NAWM mask that remained stable throughout the study period. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and lacunes were counted on SWI and FLAIR, respectively, according to established criteria (30,31). Chronic cortical infarcts were also identified on baseline images using FLAIR and T1 as wedge-shaped FLAIR hyperintense lesions with T1 cortical hypointensity at least 5 mm in diameter in a vascular territory.",

To accomplish this and permit longitudinal comparisons across scan sessions, at each time point, FLAIR intensity was normalized to the mean signal intensity of the gray matter and then denoised using a nonlocal means filter (25). Within the WMH penumbra, the slope of FLAIR intensity change over time was calculated at each white matter voxel using linear regression. Similar to the lesion difference method employed by Schmidt et al. (32) the regression coefficient at each voxel was converted to a Z-statistic (Figure 1) using the mean and standard deviation of the regression coefficients within stable NAWM. Z-statistics were cluster-corrected using thresholds Z  2.3 and p  0.01 based on Gaussian Random Field Theory. Regions of significant FLAIR signal change were reviewed for both increasing and decreasing intensity changes. At the border of segmented WMH and the surrounding penumbra, there were no regions that significantly decreased in FLAIR signal intensity over the study period, so WMH penumbra voxels were classified as WMH progression or stable. Penumbra voxels demonstrating increasing FLAIR signal intensity and segmented as new lesions at later time points were classified as WMH lesion progression, while all remaining penumbra voxels were classified as stable.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this longitudinal study of participants with prior ischemic stroke or TIA, we detected an increasing WMH volume remote from the infarct of 2.9 ml per year over 1-2 years that was preceded by locally elevated DTI FW. Based on our literature review, this is the first study to demonstrate the predictive properties of FW for the progression of WMH. Elevated MD Tissue and decreased FA Tissue , each corrected for FW, also preceded the development of new WMH. However, we did not detect changes in FA Tissue over time. Of these DTI metrics, baseline FW provided the best discriminatory index for predicting the local progression of WMH penumbra into new WMH, improving upon the classification performance of clinical measures alone. As expected, since WMHs were segmented and confirmed using FLAIR images, the normalized FLAIR signal increased as new WMH developed.\nLocally elevated and rising FW over time likely reflects the accumulation of interstitial fluid within NAWM tissue. The accumulation of interstitial fluid contributes to the conspicuity of WMH on FLAIR. An accumulation of FW may represent fluid shifts from the vascular space to the interstitial space, which might occur in the setting of increased vascular permeability, reduced clearance, or both. Prior in vivo studies have demonstrated increased BBB permeability in chronic SVD (5), and pathology studies have found excess fibrinogen deposition in chronic cerebrovascular lesions, supporting this hypothesis (34,35). Alternatively, reduced clearance could occur in the setting of venous pathology, and prior studies have found an association between elevated FW and venous disruption on susceptibilityweighted MRI at 7 Tesla in patients with SVD (36). Pathology studies have also found more venous collagenosis associated with a higher WMH burden (7). More recently, a role for impaired glymphatic drainage has also been proposed for the pathogenesis of WMH lesions (37). Arteriolosclerosis is the most common pathologic correlate to WMH on imaging, (38) and arteriolar stiffening, or reduced compliance, impairs vasomotion and paravascular fluid clearance, thereby resulting in interstitial fluid accumulation (39). These phenomena may also be reflected by enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), which are also associated with SVD risk factors, SVD imaging markers, and cognition in SVD and stroke patients (40-43). The FW fraction likely partially reflects fluid in the PVS since most PVS are below the resolution of diffusion imaging.\nPrevious studies of middle-aged to older adult community populations have also demonstrated reduced integrity of NAWM in the WMH penumbra, including reduced FA and cerebral blood flow and increased FLAIR intensity, MD, and FW (9, 12, 15, 16,20). A cross-sectional study recently demonstrated increased white matter FW extending 8 mm from the edge of FLAIR WMH in a large cohort of community participants with elevated cardiovascular risk (20). Longitudinal studies have also shown that reduced FA and cerebral blood flow and increased normalized FLAIR intensity and MD precede the development of WMH over time (10,15,17). Khan et al. (44) also demonstrated DTI changes preceding new WMH development from 3 months to 1 year after ischemic stroke. By applying a 3-tissue diffusion signal composition to DTI images, they found that white matter progressing to new WMH already demonstrated more CSF-like and gray matter-like signals and less white matter-like signals at baseline compared to non-progressing NAWM (44). In this study, we build upon these findings by demonstrating that elevated FW precedes progression of NAWM into WMH and provides better discriminatory classification than tissue DTI measures, suggesting that accumulation of interstitial fluid plays a key pathogenic role in the development of new WMH lesions.\nWhile baseline FA Tissue was lower in the penumbra voxels progressing to WMH than those that did not progress, FA Tissue was lower still in the NAWM and lowest in chronic WMH. This discrepancy has been demonstrated previously and is due to normal anatomical variation in FA: more central and periventricular white matter bundles (where WMH predominates) tend to be more heavily myelinated than fibers located closer to the cortical surface (9,12,20). Normalizing FA to an FA atlas of healthy controls can circumvent the anatomical variation in FA ( 16), although we did not find reports using this approach with FA Tissue measures.\nNormalized FLAIR intensity has also been identified as a sensitive, continuous measure for cerebrovascular disease. Rather than dichotomizing FLAIR images as lesions or NAWM, FLAIR intensity provides complementary information to DTI in predicting new lesions (16). In this study, we used normalized FLAIR intensity to reliably identify WMH growth. Most prior studies performed lesion segmentation on FLAIR and then subtracted lesion masks. To reduce the risk of false positive changes, we examined changes in normalized FLAIR intensity directly, similar to the methods developed by Schmidt et al. for the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (32). However, rather than compare two time-point differences, we evaluated the slope over multiple time points. In this manner, we identified WMHs that are reliably progressing when compared to NAWM that is not progressing. The limitations of this approach are that it may be conservative and that shorter duration fluctuations in WMH progression and regression will be missed due to the assumption of linearity. We did not find regional WMH regression in the WMH penumbra over 1 year in this cohort, but evaluation of individual time-point differences might reveal instances of WMH regression (45,46). This method of comparing normalized FLAIR intensities voxel-wise may be less reliable in participants undergoing more dramatic brain structural changes, such as during the first 3 months after stroke (47), or over much longer time periods when significant brain atrophy is likely. However, morphometric approaches using non-linear brain alignment could be more effective for detecting voxelwise progression, particularly when dynamic structural changes are expected.\nPrior efforts to harmonize DTI acquisition and post-processing techniques for multi-site clinical studies have focused on the conventional DTI measures FA and MD, using various region of interest approaches and histogram methods to capture a wholebrain measure of SVD that best reflects clinical and cognitive status (48). Similar attempts to harmonize FW measures are underway as part of the MARK VCID network (49). Regional approaches, on the other hand, may capture more subtle tissue changes over shorter time periods. This may lend more power to understanding pathophysiology and detecting treatment effects, but it remains to be determined how closely these regional changes relate to disability, cognitive performance, or progression to dementia.\nWhile the strengths of this study include multiple, frequent follow-up visits over 1-2 years (median 4 visits per participant, 112 visits total), the number of participants is relatively small, which may limit generalizability and limit our analysis of clinical risk factors or other imaging markers that may also predict WMH progression. Blood pressure control, in particular, was not measured in this study but is the most significant clinical predictor for WMH progression. However, the focus of this study was to compare the predictive value of DTI metrics within at-risk white matter regions for classifying the voxel-wise progression of WMH, for which the sample size was 953,568 voxels. Finally, while we investigated WMH remote from chronic infarction as an indicator of underlying SVD, we cannot exclude subclinical cardioembolic or atheroembolic events as additional contributors to WMH progression. While prior studies found that WMH progressed faster in the setting of prior small vessel stroke, (50) our sample size was likely insufficient to identify differential progression due to index stroke etiology.\nWhile prior studies have evaluated longitudinal changes in FA and MD in NAWM progressing to WMH, here, we also identify longitudinal changes in NAWM FW, which has recently been reported to be more closely associated with SVD disability and cognitive processing speed than other imaging markers of SVD (19). However, we estimated FW by applying a bi-tensor model to DTI with a single high B-value, which requires additional assumptions, parameter initialization, and spatial regularization (27,28). Single-shell FW methods have also been shown to be affected by tissue perfusion that may result in an overestimation of the FW content (51). Multi-shell DTI would provide a more robust FW measure but requires longer scan times. For this reason, clinical DTI sequences are typically single-shell, so most of the recent studies using DTI FW in cerebrovascular disease have used similar approaches and yet have still demonstrated robust clinical relevance for the single-shell-derived FW measure.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable interest in improving clinical and neurobiological characterisation of frontotemporal dementia and in defining the role of brain network disintegration in its pathogenesis, information about white matter pathway alterations in frontotemporal dementia remains limited. Here we investigated white matter tract damage using an unbiased, template-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol in a cohort of 27 patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) representing both major genetic and sporadic forms, in relation both to healthy individuals and to patients with Alzheimers disease. Widespread white matter tract pathology was identified in the bvFTD group compared with both healthy controls and Alzheimers disease group, with prominent involvement of uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle and corpus callosum. Relatively discrete and distinctive white matter profiles were associated with genetic subgroups of bvFTD associated with MAPT and C9ORF72 mutations. Comparing diffusivity metrics, optimal overall separation of the bvFTD group from the healthy control group was signalled using radial diffusivity, whereas optimal overall separation of the bvFTD group from the Alzheimers disease group was signalled using fractional anisotropy. Comparing white matter changes with regional grey matter atrophy (delineated using voxel based morphometry) in the bvFTD cohort revealed co-localisation between modalities particularly in the anterior temporal lobe, however",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a major neurodegenerative syndrome of younger life Ratnavalli et al., 2002. It is the most common of the canonical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The syndrome is led by progressive decline in personality and inter-personal skills with emergence of a range of behavioral abnormalities including obsessionality, loss of empathy and apathy Rascovsky et al., 2011. Most cases are associated with pathology in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum, however pathological substrates are heterogeneous Rohrer et al., 2011;Seelaar et al., 2011. The neuroimaging features of bvFTD are also variable: typically, there is cortical atrophy involving the frontal and temporal lobes, often asymmetric between the cerebral hemispheres Rohrer et al., 2011;Whitwell and Josephs, 2011. Despite much recent interest, prediction of tissue pathology from clinical and neuroanatomical features in bvFTD remains problematic Seelaar et al., 2011, yet this is likely to be crucial both for understanding the neurobiology of bvFTD and for the evaluation and monitoring of future disease-modifying therapies. The concept of network-led neurodegeneration offers a potentially unifying neurobiological basis for the diverse spectrum of clinical and neuroimaging phenotypes produced by pathogenic proteins Raj et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2012. Network disintegration in bvFTD has been demonstrated using functional MRI and distributed grey matter changes compatible with network breakdown have been established Rohrer et al., 2010;Seeley et al., 2009;Whitwell and Josephs, 2011;Whitwell et al., 2005Whitwell et al., , 2012. In particular, an anteriorly directed salience processing network including anterior cingulate, insula and prefrontal cortices has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bvFTD Seeley et al., 2009. However, there remains a paucity of information on the changes occurring within white matter tracts, which provide structural connectivity underpinning largescale brain networks by binding together cortical and subcortical regions. Furthermore, besides common syndromic profiles of network damage there may be distinct neuroanatomical subgroups within the bvFTD spectrum with relative specificity for particular molecular pathologies Warren et al., 2012. Identifying profiles of white matter pathway damage along molecular lines in bvFTD would both validate the concept of network-led degeneration and potentially allow additional (or more robust) stratification of neuroanatomical subgroups within the bvFTD spectrum that might map more closely onto pathological and genetic substrates.\nThe comparatively recent advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows such white matter tract profiles to be delineated. A particular potential strength of DTI is the generation of multiple quantitative metrics of white matter alteration (diffusivity) during a single acquisition. The neurobiological significance of these metrics remains relatively little explored: whilst fractional anisotropy (FA) has been the most widely cited metric, more recent studies have suggested that use of the individual parameters of diffusion may be more appropriate in neurodegeneration Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Mahoney et al., 2013. Further it has been suggested that particular DTI metrics such as axial diffusivity (AX) radial diffusivity (RD) and trace diffusivity (TR) may have specificity for particular pathologies Nair et al., 2005;Song et al., 2002 although this remains controversial Jones et al., 2013;Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani, 2009. Previous studies (see Table I) of white matter tract damage in bvFTD have been relatively small and there is limited information about tract alterations associated with particular bvFTD pathologies and how these compare with other common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Often only FA has been assessed, potentially anatomically biased seed-based approaches have been used or technical factors such as normalisation-associated distortion have not been fully addressed Agosta et al., 2011;Whitwell et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2009Zhang et al., , 2013. More fundamentally, it remains unclear how white matter alterations relate to the more familiar profiles of grey matter atrophy in bvFTD.\nIn this study, we set out to define in detail profiles of white matter tract damage using DTI in a comprehensively characterized cohort of patients with bvFTD representing major genetic as well as sporadic forms, in relation both to healthy control individuals and to patients with AD. We hypothesized that separable profiles of white matter pathology would be identified within this broad bvFTD spectrum and in comparison to AD. Subsidiary aims of our study were to compare the profiles of different diffusivity metrics in bvFTD, using anatomically unbiased tract-based and customised dementia template-based techniques; and to compare white matter alterations in relation to the distribution of grey matter atrophy.",

It also reduces image distortion in regions affected by severe atrophy and provides greater detail on distal parts of white matter tracts compared with the standard TBSS pipeline (compare images generated using this versus standard approaches in Supporting Information Fig. 1).",

    "Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Data": {
      "text": "To assess disease effects on white matter structures a general linear model was created with disease group membership as the factor of interest and age, gender, and disease duration (as a surrogate of disease severity and stage) included as nuisance covariates. Each metric (AX RDTRFA) was analyzed with the above model, and additionally with a model that included the overall mean of the metric under study as an additional covariate. The latter model reveals areas that are specifically affected after adjusting for widespread global differences, analogous to controlling for total grey matter volume in voxel-based morphometry Mechelli et al., 2005. Models were contrasted with both healthy and disease control groups. A genetic subgroup analysis was performed comparing MAPT and C9ORF72 mutation groups with healthy individuals, the AD disease group and with each other using the same model design. Statistical analysis was implemented using the permutation-based (nonparametric) randomise tool within FSL with 10,000 permutations for each test. A significance threshold (P  0.05) was applied after correction for multiple comparisons using familywise error (FWE) correction with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) Smith and Nichols, 2009. Significant results were projected onto a study-specific average brain registered to standard (Montreal Neurological Institute; MNI) space. To provide accurate anatomic localisation a series of tract-specific masks were applied to the significant whole brain results. Tracts corresponding to major white matter structures were selected from a probabilistic atlas Mori et al., 2004, and to adjust for the anatomical variability of the tract thresholded at a likelihood of overlap across individuals of 20, this moderately stringent threshold is also likely to reduce contamination within regions-of-interest by reducing partial volume effects and erroneous inclusion of grey matter. This figure was deemed acceptable as it allowed for maximal tract coverage whilst minimising the possibility of overlap between neighbouring tracts (i.e. inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus, see Supporting Information Fig. 2). The aim was to include the core of the tract, whilst excluding peripheral parts of the tract with high interindividual variability Hua et al., 2008. A total of 14 binary masks were created, covering major white matter pathways including right and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), uncinate fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulum bundle, corticospinal tract (CST), corpus callosum, and fornix. Further information on the significant (FWE-corrected) results was extracted from within each anatomical mask (using FSLs fslstats). The proportion of significantly affected voxels within each tract was calculated by dividing the number of significant voxels identified by the total number of voxels within each tract limited to within the skeleton. In addition, to assess the anatomical reliability of results obtained from the group skeleton, result maps were de-projected and overlaid on each individual participants FA image, which confirmed good anatomical alignment of the results with white matter tracts.",

Final DARTEL transformations were combined with affine transformations to MNI space. To maintain consistency with the white matter analysis, grey matter was assessed using the same statistical methodology. Nonparametric permutation testing (n 5 10,000) was used to examine differences in regional grey matter volume between groups and included age, gender, total intracranial volume and disease duration as nuisance covariates. Maps of grey matter atrophy were overlaid onto an MNI152 standard brain after FWE correction (P  0.05) with TFCE. To provide information on the anatomical relationship of the grey and white matter changes, an intersection map of all four DTI metrics (derived by combining the individual mean-adjusted bvFTD versus healthy control result maps, thresholded using FWE-correction P  0.05) were overlaid on the map of grey matter atrophy.",

Of those with definite bvFTD nine had mutations in the MAPT gene (five harbored the intron 10 1 16 mutation, two harbored the exon 13 R406W mutation, one harbored the exon 10 P301S mutation, and one harbored a novel mutation in exon 12 resulting in a single amino acid substitution at codon 351 (Q351R)), four had mutations in C9ORF72 and one patient who subsequently died was found to have Picks disease pathology at postmortem. In addition to meeting diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, two patients had symptoms compatible with Progressive Supranucelar Palsy (both having sporadic bvFTD), two had symptoms compatible with motor neuron disease (one having a C9ORF72 mutation, one being sporadic) and one had symptoms compatible with corticobasal syndrome (being sporadic). All AD patients had a typical memory-led presentation. Demographic, clinical and neuropsychological data for all participant groups are summarised in Table II. The healthy control and AD groups were comparable in age and gender characteristics (healthy control group mean age 64.5 6 4.5 years, male 5 1320; AD group mean age 63.1 65.2 years; male 5 1725). CSF data was available on 13 of 27 bvFTD patients, all had profiles compatible with non-Alzheimers pathology (normal Abeta1-42 and normal or elevated total tau), although one subject had low Abeta1-42 and lownormal tau which was felt to be consistent with a handling error. CSF data was available on 11 of 25 AD patients, all had profiles compatible with AD pathology (low Abeta1-42, elevated total tau).

Profiles of performance in the patient groups were in keeping with clinical syndromes: both disease groups showed widespread deficits compared with the healthy control group, however, the AD group performed inferiorly to the bvFTD group on tests of arithmetic and general executive capacity while the bvFTD group performed inferiorly to the AD group on semantic processing.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Here we have employed quantitative, image registration-based DTI methods to demonstrate profiles of white matter tract damage in a large cohort of patients with bvFTD, representing the major genetic and sporadic disease subtypes. Considering the bvFTD cohort firstly as a whole, white matter changes in comparison to healthy older individuals were extensive, distributed in both cerebral hemispheres with particularly prominent involvement of the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle and corpus callosum. This white matter profile was identified after taking disease severity into account; moreover, a similar emphasis of white matter tract alterations was identified when the bvFTD group was compared with the AD group, suggesting that involvement of these tracts may be a relatively specific index of pathologies in the bvFTD spectrum. The findings were further consolidated by adjusting for the effects of global mean diffusivity: after global adjustment, involvement of uncinate fasciculus was a prominent and consistent indicator of bvFTD pathology compared both with healthy individuals and patients with AD.\nThese findings build upon and extend previous studies of white matter tract involvement in bvFTD Agosta et al., 2011;Borroni et al., 2007;Matsuo et al., 2008;Whitwell et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2009Zhang et al., , 2011Zhang et al., , 2013.

However, the extent of reported white matter pathway involvement has varied considerably between studies. The extensive profile of white matter alterations we have demonstrated here may be in part attributable to the use of a customised white matter template as well as the Regions of interest where at least one metric had greater than 50 extent are displayed.  extent is the percentage of significant voxels divided by total number of voxels within the masked region of the skeleton. Complete data on each metric and region of interest are provided in Supporting Information.\nr Mahoney et al. r r 4174 r comparatively large cohort, which is likely to have sampled a range of underlying pathologies within the bvFTD spectrum, as evidenced by both the genetic data and the presence of clinical features, in some participants, compatible with particular underlying pathologies. The white matter pathways delineated here are plausible candidates to mediate brain network dysfunction and the most prominently involved tracts have previously been correlated with a range of cognitive deficits in the bvFTD syndrome Tartaglia et al., 2012. The uncinate fasciculus has been associated with a range of cognitive functions and recently has been particularly implicated in the evaluation of affective and other inter-personal signals Von Der Heide et al., 2013, and in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms Phan et al., 2009 and risk-taking behaviors Linke et al., 2013: such processes are likely to be relevant to various canonical features of bvFTD Rascovsky et al., 2011. The uncinate fasciculus has also been directly implicated in the modulation of inhibition in patients with bvFTD Hornberger et al., 2011. The cingulum bundle is intimately associated with cingulate cortex, previously identified as a key component of the salience network implicated in the pathogenesis of the bvFTD syndrome Kim et al., 2012;Seeley et al., 2009;Zhou et al., 2012. Both cingulum and corpus callosum have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and executive dysfunction Bora et al., 2011;Linke et al., 2013. The ATR has been linked to aspects of attention and executive function Andreasen et al., 1996;Schmahmann and Pandya, 2008;Van der Werf et al., 2003 as well as the pathogenesis of autism Cheon et al., 2011; while the fornix has recently been identified as a key locus of damage in bvFTD Hornberger et al., 2012. The disease specificity of other white matter associations identified here, in particular, involvement of the long intrahemispheric tracts SLF and ILF, is less clear: portions of these tracts were found to be involved more prominently in either bvFTD or AD. This apparent paradox may reflect r White Matter Tract Profiles of bvFTD r r 4175 r evolution of pathology across white matter pathways common to the distributed brain networks that are targeted in these different neurodegenerative diseases. However, longitudinal data comparing syndromes and diseases will be required to resolve this.\nThe present work further suggests that DTI can delineate molecularly defined profiles of white matter pathology within the broader bvFTD spectrum. Most striking were alterations within the uncinate fasciculus in those with MAPT mutations, which persisted when compared with AD and C9ORF72 groups. These more localized changes suggest that MAPT mutations may direct pathological changes to target this ventromedial network. In contrast those with C9ORF72 mutations tended to have more dorsal white matter tract pathology, which targeted the cingulum bundle and corpus callosum. These findings are in line with evidence from previous neuroanatomical studies of genetic subtypes of bvFTD Mahoney et al., 2012aMahoney et al., , 2012b;;Rohrer et al., 2011. Notably we did not generate a significant result when MAPT was contrasted with the sporadic bvFTD group. The absence of a result may suggest that those with sporadic bvFTD and MAPT mutations have overlapping profiles of white matter pathology, at least in part, which is supported by the prominence of uncinate fasciculus involvement seen when considering all bvFTD patients collectively. This subgroup analysis does not fully resolve neuroanatomical subtyping of molecularly defined bvFTD: case numbers across subgroups were small (precluding, for example, differentiation of individual mutations within each subgroup) while certain key bvFTD phenotypes (in particular, bvFTD due to progranulin gene mutations and sporadic forms of bvFTD associated syndromes of atypical parkinsonism or motor neurone disease) were either underrepresented or not represented at all. The likely variability of pathologies within the sporadic bvFTD group may also have limited the ability to detect white matter changes specific to this group. Taking these caveats into account, the present findings provide further evidence that the profile of regional brain network disintegration in bvFTD may be modulated by underlying molecular pathologies Warren et al., 2012 and that DTI can assist in differentiating these pathologies in vivo.\nThe compatibility of different diffusivity metrics is an issue of considerable clinical and neurobiological relevance to the application of DTI in neurodegenerative disease. While our findings suggest partial convergence of metrics for particular white matter tracts, we found additional substantial divergence in the white matter profiles generated using different diffusivity metrics across both sporadic and genetic forms of bvFTD (and indeed, also within the AD neurodegenerative control group; compare Figures 1 to 4 and 6, and Supporting Information Tables I to III). In principle, there is likely to be a trade-off between higher sensitivity and higher specificity for any candidate DTI metric, presenting a practical problem of optimisation if particular metrics are in future to be used as disease biomarkers. It may be that some DTI metrics have higher inter-subject variability, in both healthy and affected individuals, and after discounting for these affects (as we do by adjusting for global mean diffusivity), the overall extent of change may be less emphatic. After adjusting for global mean diffusivity values to enhance regional anatomical specificity, we identified disproportionate involvement of uncinate fasciculus, suggesting it may be a candidate for monitoring white matter changes in bvFTD across diffusivity metrics. This was further corroborated by a formal ROC analysis assessing the separability of bvFTD from healthy individuals and patients with AD (Fig. 5). Comparing global brain diffusivity values, RD and TR appeared most sensitive in distinguishing bvFTD from healthy controls, in keeping with previous work Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2011;Mahoney et al., 2013 and suggesting these metrics might potentially assist in early bvFTD diagnosis. On the other hand, FA appeared to be have a greater specificity in distinguishing bvFTD from AD, suggesting that this metric might be preferred as a future disease biomarker (for example, in treatment trials targeting particular pathologies). However, data in the genetic subgroups (see Supporting Information Table III) suggest that the optimal diffusivity metric may be further stratified within the bvFTD spectrum. These discrepant findings between DTI metrics may have face validity. Firstly, whilst previous studies suggest that AX or RD may be superior to FA in detecting white matter pathology in neurodegeneration, none have made direct comparisons between different disease groups. Secondly, a number of studies within other degenerative conditions have demonstrated that FA has some specificity in distinguishing different disease subtypes Menke et al., 2012;Prakash et al., 2009 This underlines the need to take the specific application into account when evaluating candidate DTI metrics Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010. Variation among DTI metrics may in addition potentially hold neurobiological insights: for example, the apparent discrepancy between RD and FA in signifying bvFTD (whether referenced to healthy controls or to AD) might be driven by changes in either RD or AX as change in either metric could affect FA.\nA related key issue concerns the relationship of grey matter atrophy to white matter damage in bvFTD. Here, changes in white matter tracts occurred in close anatomical proximity to regions of grey matter loss but were more spatially distributed (see Fig. 6). In line with this another recent study has also found somewhat more widespread white matter changes in bvFTD when compared with AD Zhang et al., 2011. White matter and grey matter alterations were most robustly co-localized in the right anterior temporal lobe including the most consistently involved white matter tract, the uncinate fasciculus. There is a need for caution when comparing different neuroimaging modalities, such as DTI and VBM. However, the greater spatial extent of white matter damage might reflect distal propagation of pathology from primarily involved regions adjacent to regions of grey matter damage (due for r Mahoney et al. r r 4176 r example to pathogenic protein diffusion or withdrawal of trophic support) Hardy and Revesz, 2012;Warren et al., 2012; alternatively, however, white matter pathology might drive grey matter loss, such that over time grey matter atrophy spreads to become more contiguous with white matter damage. Substantial emerging histopathological evidence suggests that white matter pathology may be significant in bvFTD Ahmed et al., 2011;Hiji et al., 2008;Neumann et al., 2007, may develop early in the disease process Broe et al., 2004;Martin et al., 2001 and may promote subsequent upstream cortical degeneration Drzezga et al., 2011;Villain et al., 2008. Detailed longitudinal analyses assessing the evolution of white matter and grey matter alterations in tandem will be required to resolve these possibilities.",

    "CONCLUSIONS": {
      "text": "This work has identified profiles of white matter tract damage in a large, representative cohort of patients with bvFTD, demonstrating a distributed signature of white matter alterations that is likely to be core to the pathophysiology of the syndrome and suggesting that this signature is modulated by underlying molecular pathologies. The study has highlighted a number of directions for further work. Important limitations of the present study include a sparsity of particular genetic and clinical bvFTD subtypes and lack of histopathological correlation. Analysis of altered structural connectivity may be further refined by inclusion of robust clinical severity and neuropsychological measures within future imaging datasets. Future studies will also likely require multi-centre collaborations in order to recruit substantial case numbers across the bvFTD spectrum and among disease controls, to follow these cohorts longitudinally with white and grey matter imaging modalities, and to correlate phenotypic with pathological features. Ideally this should also include histomorphometry to assess the relationship between microstructural diffusion imaging changes, histopathological changes in WM tracts and regional grey matter damage. In addition to these logistical and neurobiological challenges, this study has identified a number of technical challenges in the application and interpretation of DTI in a heterogeneous syndrome such as DTI. Foremost amongst these is the richness of most DTI datasets: it remains unclear how best to assess diffusivity metrics in relation to one another, or whether peak change, extent of change or some combination is the optimal index of disease. This is true even for unitary pathologies such as AD but is compounded in the face of diverse histopathological substrates in bvFTD. The present data show extensive overlap between metrics and tracts among diseases (bvFTD and AD) and putative bvFTD subtypes. Ultimately, the solution may lie in the use of multivariate or multimodal indices and composite profiles of tract alteration that are informed by an improved understanding of the pathobiology of white matter diffusion and the natural history of particular bvFTD pathologies Avants et al., 2010;Groves et al., 2011;Naylor et al., in press A further challenge is the anatomical configuration of relevant white matter pathways in bvFTD (in particular, crossing fibres) which may only be resolved by improved imaging pipelines Jbabdi et al., 2010 and using methods such as tractography to assess in greater detail the alterations within particular tracts. These many challenges notwithstanding, our findings together with previous work provide a clear rationale for the further evaluation of DTI as a candidate clinical biomarker and neurobiological probe in bvFTD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Both micro-and macrostructural white matter (WM) abnormalities, particularly those related to axonal degeneration, are associated with cognitive decline in adults with Down syndrome (DS) prior to a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a support protein within myelinated axons released into blood following axonal damage. In this study we investigated cross-sectional relationships between WM microstructural changes as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and plasma NfL concentration in adults with DS without dementia. METHODS: Thirty cognitively stable (CS) adults with DS underwent diffusionweighted MRI scanning and plasma NfL measurement. DTI measures of select WM tracts were derived using automatic fiber tracking, and associations with plasma NfL were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Higher Plasma NfL was associated with greater altered diffusion measures of select tracts. DISCUSSION: Early increases in plasma NfL may reflect early white matter microstructural changes prior to dementia in DS.

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Advances in the health care of adults with Down syndrome (DS), one of the most common causes of intellectual disability (ID), 1 has resulted in the life expectancy in DS to exceed 60. 2 However, by age 40, most adults with DS develop Alzheimers disease (AD)-related pathology, and many develop clinical symptoms of dementia by age 60. 3 The high incidence of AD in people with DS is due to the triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is located on chromosome 21.\nAPP causes extracellular deposition of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide in the form of Aβ plaques 4 , which may accumulate on white matter (WM) fibers or cause stress to surrounding cells and may also be cytotoxic to WM. WM changes play an important role in late-onset AD among neurotypical adults and occur in adults with DS, including in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 6,7 However, little is known about WM integrity in cognitively stable (CS) adults with DS.\nNeurofilament light chain (NfL) is a cytoskeletal protein found within large, myelinated axons in cerebral WM. 8 It is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood following axonal damage and can be indicative of neurodegeneration. 9 Plasma NfL concentration is a potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarker for a variety of neurological disorders, including AD. 9 In DS, plasma NfL may be one of the earliest biomarkers to change before a clinical AD diagnosis, as early as 20 years prior to clinical diagnosis. 10 Plasma NfL concentration also increases at a significantly faster rate in adults with DS than in matched neurotypical adults. 11 Increases in plasma andor CSF NfL concentration can differentiate DS adults with MCI-DSAD dementia (AD-DS) from those who are CS (ie, individuals without any evidence of cognitive decline). 12,13 Several studies have found associations between plasma concentration of NfL and indices of WM integrity in other neurodegenerative disorders. 14,15 However, few studies have focused on individuals without dementia. Such studies could provide important insights into early pathological processes that could herald AD; this possibility is especially true in the DS population, where such associations could provide a strong rationale for early interventions aimed at preventing or delaying onset of AD.\nIn this study, we evaluated associations between WM microstructure in CS adults with DS and plasma NfL concentrations. We hypothesized that associations between these two measures would be specific to WM tracts we previously identified as selectively vulnerable in CS adults with DS, including the corpus callosum, cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). 6,7 Our findings provide support for widespread changes in WM integrity in CS adults with DS that are associated with elevations in NfL, suggesting that early pathological processes are already under way in CS adults with DS. Moreover, they suggest that early intervention may be necessary to prevent or delay onset of AD in DS.",

Neighboring DWI correlation and the number of slices with signal dropout were inspected as measures of quality. Neighboring DWI correlation was calculated as the correlation between DWI volumes with similar gradient direction. The number of slices with dropout was evaluated as a percentage of the total number of slices in the scan (in the present study, 198 frames  92 slices per frame  18,216 slices). Three participants whose neighboring DWI correlation was less than three median absolute deviations or who had signal dropout in more than 0.1 of the total number of slices (ie,  18 slices) were excluded from further analysis.\nDWI data were reconstructed in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR) to obtain the spin distribution function (SDF) 23 with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. Automatic fiber tracking was performed to track the cingulum, corpus callosum, ILF, SLF, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic pathways, using a deterministic fiber-tracking algorithm, 24 as these were previously identified as selectively vulnerable in DS. Each subjects quantitative anisotropy (QA) map was normalized to the MNI QA map, and the Human Connectome Project-842 tractography atlas was used to guide track recognition 25 and topology-informed pruning to filter out false tracts. 22 A seeding region was placed at the pathway of interest and tracking was performed with an anisotropy threshold randomly selected from 0.6 to 0.8 Otsus threshold, an angular threshold randomly selected from 15  to 90  and step size randomly selected from 0.5 to 1.5 voxels. Tracts with length shorter than 30 or longer than 300 mm were discarded. A total of 10,000 tracts were calculated for each pathway, and the following parameters were extracted from each participant for further statistical analysis: average axial diffusiv-ity (AxD), which measures diffusion along the preferential direction of diffusion; radial diffusivity (RD), which measures the magnitude of diffusion orthogonal to the preferential direction; fractional anisotropy (FA), which refers to the degree in which there is a preferential direction in the diffusion of water molecules; and mean diffusivity (MD), which refers to the rotationally invariant magnitude of water diffusion within brain tissue values were extracted from each participant for statistical analysis. Higher AxD, RD, MD, and lower FA reflect altered WM microstructural integrity.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Our findings support the concept of an important link between alterations in WM integrity and widespread axonal degeneration in CS adults with DS. We demonstrate that WM microstructural properties are associated with axonal degeneration as operationalized by plasma NfL concentration. These results suggest that WM integrity in DS is altered early, before the clinical expression of cognitive deficits associated with AD. Specifically, we found negative correlations between NfL concentration and FA and positive correlations of NfL concentration with AxD, RD, and MD. Associations between diffusion measures and NfL echo previous studies demonstrating that the corpus callosum and limbic pathways (including the fornix) are particularly susceptible to degeneration in presymptomatic autosomal-dominant AD gene carriers, 30,31 suggesting a parallel between AD-DS and non-DS familial AD. We also found correlations that imply altered integrity in the ILF and SLF, two key late-myelinating pathways. This finding is consistent with the retrogenesis model of AD, which postulates that late-myelinating fibers are more vulnerable to degeneration than early-myelinating fibers 32 and builds on existing evidence that early changes in myelin play a key role in DS neuropathology. 33 Associations between the microstructural integrity of the cingulum, which has been shown to be reduced in children with DS, 7,34 and NfL suggest that there may also be a link between neurodevelopmental alterations and risk of AD pathology. This is supported by our exploratory analyses, which identified associations between diffusion measures and NfL in additional regions. For example, the frontal TA B L E 2 Spearman (𝜌) correlations between neurofilament light chain and white matter tract. u-fibers, aslant fibers, 35 and arcuate fasciculus are WM tracts that support speech and language and have been shown to predict cognitive decline in the AD spectrum. 36 Acoustic radiations, especially in children and adolescents with DS, have been reported to demonstrate early deficits in discrimination and auditory memory. 37 The cerebellum is typically hypoplastic in DS but does not typically demonstrate WM alterations until adulthood. 38 Abnormalities of the visual cortex have been hypothesized to contribute to the decreased visual acuity experienced by some people with DS 39 and may reflect the associations we found in the optic radiations; in addition, the radiations span temporal and parietal cortical areas, areas that demonstrate early and progressive accumulation of amyloid by PET. 40,41 Further studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of neurodevelopmental abnormalities on neurodegenerative processes in later life.",

      "text": "Greater associations between NfL were also found in individuals who were amyloid positive but CS, which suggests that Aβ 1-42mediated toxicity on myelination may be another driver in the pathological model of early axonal degeneration, 5,42 or, conversely, myelin dysfunction may drive Aβ deposition, 43 an active area of investigation.\nOverall, we surveyed pathways from all levels of circuitry. Higher-order association fibers (cingulum, ILF, and SLF), commissural fibers (corpus callosum), and projection fibers (corticostriatal and corticothalamic pathways) all displayed evidence of early axonal damage. Simultaneous correlations of NfL with AxD, RD, MD, and FA suggest that early axonal degeneration may reflect combined pathological processes of demyelination, cerebrovascular disease, 44 andor neuronal loss.\nOur results build on previous work showing the importance of WM integrity in AD-DS onset and progression and introduce plasma NfL",

    "abstract": "Backgroundobjectives: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition where in early diagnosis and interventions are key policy priorities in dementia services and research. We studied the functional and structural connectivity in mild AD to determine the nature of connectivity changes that coexist with neurocognitive deficits in the early stages of AD. Methods: Fifteen mild AD subjects and 15 cognitively healthy controls (CHc) matched for age and gender, underwent detailed neurocognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Rest fMRI was analyzed using dual regression approach and DTI by voxel wise statistics. Results: Patients with mild AD had significantly lower functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network and increased FC within the executive network. The mild AD group scored significantly lower in all domains of cognition compared with CHc. But fractional anisotropy did not significantly (p  0.05) differ between the groups. Conclusion: Resting state functional connectivity alterations are noted during initial stages of cognitive decline in AD, even when there are no significant white matter microstructural changes.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by irreversible, progressive cognitive decline involving memory, attention, and executive functions (McKeith and Cummings, 2005;Weiner et al., 2005). Cognitive decline in AD has been shown to be associated with neurodegenerative changes in bilateral medial temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes (Delbeuck et al., 2007;Bagepally et al., 2012). Deficits in white matter microstructural integrity resulting in structural disconnection in AD have been demonstrated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Bagepally et al., 2012). The structural disconnection may also be associated with functional disconnection between brain regions that show neurodegenerative changes associated with the AD (Greicius et al., 2009). Various biomarkers of neuronal function have been shown to be useful in detecting AD even before structural brain changes have set in. (Hoozemans et al., 2006;Ewers et al., 2011). Functional connectivity (FC) within a defined network may be considered as an indirect indicator of the trans-synaptic activity; therefore, FC may be affected earlier to observable structural changes in early stages of AD.\nAnatomically distinct regions that exhibit FC at rest are termed as resting state networks (RSN). These RSNs can be extracted from low frequency fluctuations of blood oxygen level dependent signals arising from spatially distinct brain regions (Binnewijzend et al., 2012). Previous AD studies have reported disruption and deficits in some of these RSN, such as default mode network (DMN), executive network, and thalamocortical networks (Bai et al., 2008;Sperling et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2012;Binnewijzend et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2013). These functional deficits probably underlie the cognitive deficits in early stages of AD, which can be assessed by detailed neuropsychological assessments.\nPublished neuroimaging work in AD is either on structural or functional changes in comparison to age-matched cognitively healthy control subjects (Delbeuck et al., 2007;Bagepally et al., 2012). Studies that have combined functional MRI, DTI, and neuropsychological assessments in the clinically mild stages of AD are sparse. Our objective was to study the WM structural connectivity using DTI-tract based spatial statistics (TBSS), FC of brain networks during rest, and neuropsychological assessment. By this comprehensive evaluation, we hoped to make preliminary inferences regarding structural andor FC disturbances that may coexist in AD patients in the early stages of their illness.\nWe hypothesized that mild AD patients will have deficits in their neurocognitive functions, more so in episodic memory compared with age and gender matched controls (cognitively healthy controls (CHc)).We also hypothesized that mild AD patients will have deficits in FC and structural connectivity (white matter tracts) compared with CHc.",

      "text": "National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences NNB-E a comprehensive battery for measuring attention, memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial construction, and parietal focal signs was used. NNB-E includes Word List (immediate and delayed recall) for verbal memory, Story Recall Test (immediate and delayed recall) for logical memory, Stick Construction Test (visuospatial construction, immediate and delayed recall) for visual memory, Digit Span, Corsi block-tapping test (working memory), Category fluency and Picture cancelation for sustained attention, NNB-E is discussed elsewhere in detail (Tripathi et al., 2013). subjects magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo using boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl, 2009) and subsequently normalized to standard space (MNI152) images using nonlinear registration with a warp resolution of 10 mm. Boundary-based registration, a new technique for registering the low resolution image to the high resolution image using local Pearson correlation, meaning that the cost at each voxel is only dependent on nearby voxels. Alignment is achieved by maximizing the gradient of input image intensity across the surface boundary. This technique effectively enhances the spatial high pass filter and so improves edges in both input and reference image. Boundary-based registration is extremely robust to variations in its parameters, major fluctuations in image intensity inhomogeneity, and to partial brain images, even to the extent of accurately registering single slices. Precision of registration was visually confirmed. Quality check of the normalization was performed by overlaying the normalized image on the template (Poldrack et al., 2011).\nLow resolution functional volumes of all the subjects were temporally concatenated to create a single fourdimensional data set. The data set was decomposed into independent components (ICA) using a Laplacian approximation. Among the 32 independent components obtained by ICA, the resting state networks relevant to AD (default mode network, thalamic resting state network, and executive network) were recognized based on the spatial pattern described earlier (Bai et al., 2008;Agosta et al., 2012;Binnewijzend et al., 2012) and used for further analysis.\nNext, dual regression was individually performed on these RSN components. The set of spatial maps from group-average analysis was used to generate subject-specific versions of the spatial maps and associated time series (Filippini et al., 2009). Group average spatial maps were regressed into the subjects 4D space time resulting in a set of subject-specific temporal maps. We then tested for group difference by performing series of 5000 nonparametric permutation tests (using FSLs randomize tool) to detect statistical difference, within the boundaries of RSN (obtained from MELODIC) adjusting for age and gender effects. Group-specific RSN masks were created for each of the identified RSNs. These groupspecific RSN masks were used to restrict the boundaries of individual subjects preprocessed functional volumes. Finally, a family wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons was performed, implementing thresholdfree cluster enhancement (TFCE) using a significance threshold of p  0.05. Regions with significant differences (FWE corrected) (Binnewijzend et al., 2012) were reported with reference to probabilistic Harvard cortical and subcortical atlases. Montreal Neurolgical Institute (MNI) coordinates of voxel with maximum threshold were reported with reference to probabilistic atlas.",

The mean FA skeleton represents the centers of all tracts common to the entire group of subjects. Each subjects aligned FA data is then projected onto mean FA skeleton, and the resulting data are fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistical testing.

It is hypothesized that regions exhibiting higher rates of neuronal firing are more vulnerable for early amyloid deposition. This study observed a cluster of significant lower FC in the posteromedial regions of DMN in mild AD, similar to the findings reported in other studies that are performed using ICA, seed based, region of interest as well as PET studies (Wang et al., 2007;Qi et al., 2010). Reduced FC at these regions could be due to amyloid pathology. The anterior cingulate showed only a unit voxel of decreased FC and therefore needs replication in a larger sample of patients with mild AD to confirm its potential significance.",

Here, we find reduced FC in left putamen of thalamic network among mild AD group using rest fMRI. A similar result of reduced resting state FC in putamen is reported elsewhere among AD patients (Binnewijzend et al., 2012). Further reduced thalamic resting state FC are reported among MCI subjects (Wang et al., 2012).

    "Diffusion tensor imaging studies": {
      "text": "Our study could not find significant difference in FA maps between groups. Previous reports of FA abnormalities in mild AD have predominantly employed Region Of Interest (ROI) based approaches, as opposed to our whole-brain voxel-wise approach (Yakushev et al., 2011;Nowrangi et al., 2012;Tighe et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, there has been only one study by Bosch et al., reporting reduction in FA among mild AD using voxel wise whole brain white matter tract comparisons; however, the results reported in this study were unadjusted for age and gender variations (Bosch et al., 2012). Our finding using TBSS of nil significant difference in a sample of mild AD patients as opposed to our previous finding with a sample of moderate to severe AD could also be due to inherent limitation of TBSS, in detecting subtle white matter changes in mild AD.\nHere, mild AD subjects had significant FC changes without significant difference in their white matter microstructure. This could possibly indicate that FC is disrupted in mild AD patients even before significant white matter tract disruption can be detected. However, a few limitations prevent us from making this conclusion. FC is a measure of statistical dependencies, such as correlations, coherence, or transfer entropy; hence, FC is essentially a function of probability distributions over observed multivariate responses. Hence, FC does not reflect direct anatomic connections. On the other hand, DTI-TBSS analysis that involves the study of direct anatomic connections may not detect the changes observed by FC studies.\nOur findings may have implications for understanding the progression of pathophysiology in AD. The initial process includes progressive amyloid deposition in brain regions that exhibit high neuronal connectivity (posterior cingulate cortex, medial temporal lobe, and hippocampus) (Wang et al., 2007;Qi et al., 2010) leading to neuronal injury, followed by release of inflammatory cytokines (Hoozemans et al., 2006). Further leading to hypometabolism and progressive synaptic dysfunction (Ewers et al., 2011), resulting in reduced FC in networks that involve these regions, along with compensatory hyper-connectivity in the executive network that mediates top-down cognitive processing. Compensatory hyper-activations are discussed in early stages of various illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis (Audoin et al., 2003), mild cognitive impairment (Staffen et al., 2012), schizophrenia (John et al., 2011), and in individuals at risk for AD (Bondi et al., 2005). We hypothesize that neurodegenerative process initially leads to FC changes followed by microstructural white matter changes, neuronal loss and cortical atrophy (Ewers et al., 2011).\nThe limitations of this study include low sample size, non-normal distribution of neurocognitive scores, possible technical limitations that are inherent to dual regression method (Beckmann et al., 2005) and TBSS (Nakata et al., 2010).We have not discussed the significant difference in the unit under DMN, as it could have been due to possible technical limitations of fMRI analysis. We have used the standard MNI template for normalization instead of creating a study specific template. Study specific templates have been used in recent times as an alternative to the MNI template in fMRI research. The objective is to reduce potential errors due to imperfect compensation for regional discrepancies, especially in specific study populations. However, the coordinates that are generated by the use of these custom templates may not match well the standard space (Poldrack et al., 2011), thereby making the labeling of these coordinates potentially erroneous. Therefore, in our preliminary analysis of this limited sample, we chose to employ the standard MNI template for spatial normalization during preprocessing. Given the limited sample size, we used only the two most important covariates, viz. age and gender for our analysis. Other variables such as educational status that could potentially have an effect on FC were not included as covariates. However, the difference in educational status between patients with AD and control subjects was not statistically significant (p  0.09) despite the mean educational statues of patients being lower by 4 years. Future studies using larger samples that explore structural and FC in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia are therefore required to further confirm the preliminary findings of this study.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "Our results suggest that resting state FC changes precede observable white matter microstructural changes in mild AD patients. However, further research studies with large sample sizes and better models of detecting structural connectivity are needed to confirm our finding. On the basis of the evidence from previous literature and our results, we infer that RSN plays a crucial role in cognitive process in mild AD subjects. Future studies are indicated to confirm the utility of FC disturbances of RSN as a potential biomarker for diagnosing early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "HIV-associated prospective memory (ProM) impairment has emerged, in earlier studies as a significant predictor of medication management and independence in activities of daily living. The relationship between ProM and white matter integrity in HIV has not previously been investigated. Participants, including 128 HIV-infected individuals and 32 healthy controls, were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and both objective and subjective measures of ProM. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to investigate the relationship of white matter integrity to ProM in a randomly selected subsample of 40 HIV positive subjects, using a whole brain voxel-based approach to define fractional anisotrophy (FA) and mean diffusion (MD). Total prospective memory was significantly poorer in the HIV positive group when compared with healthy controls (p00.023). Time-based ProM was poorer in the HIV group compared to healthy controls both without prompts (p00.001) and with prompts (p00.001). Poor Total ProM score correlated with performance on neuropsychological tests of executive functioning, information processing speed, learning, and working memory (p0.05). Those HIV positive participants with poor ProM had significantly decreased FA in the regions of superior corona radiata (p 00.0035), the corpus collosum (p00.006) and the cingulum (p00.0033) when compared to those who were HIV positive with good ProM. This study reinforces the importance of ProM assessment in HIV.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Prospective memory (ProM), or remembering to remember, refers to the execution of a future intention. Intention may be defined as an individuals specific purpose in performing an action or series of actions. ProM generally involves a series of cognitive processes that includes: (a) the formation of an intention that is paired with a time or event; (b) maintenance of the intention-cue pairing over a delay interval while concurrently engaged in other tasks, (c) detection and recognition of the cue; (d) search and retrieval from retrospective memory (RM) for the content of the intention; and (e) successful execution of the intention (McDaniel et al. 1999). A distinction is often made between event-based and time-based ProM tasks (Einstein and McDaniel 1990). The difference between these two tasks concerns the type of cues that initiate retrieval of the intention. An external stimulus provides the cue for action in an event-based task (e.g., grocery store cues the buying of sugar), whereas in a time-based task, the intended action is performed after a specified time interval (e.g., taking a medication every 12 h). Both these aspects of ProM would therefore be important when carrying out instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).\nRecent research shows that individuals infected with HIV-1 demonstrated more frequent deficits in ProM as compared to demographically similar healthy controls (Carey et al. 2006). Another study showed that ProM demonstrated incremental ecological validity as a predictor of dependence in IADLs in HIV (Woods et al. 2008). The profile of ProM impairment in HIV is thought to reflect a deficient retrieval of future intentions. In support of this interpretation, a HIV positive group in a study conducted by Carey et al., performed comparably to a healthy control sample on a recognition task. This may indicate that minimizing the self-initiated retrieval demands of the task allowed the HIV positive group to identify the correct intention and cue (Carey et al. 2006). Intact ProM is critical in order to properly adhere to a medication regimen. One must first form the intention to take the medication at a future point, then maintain the intention-cue pairing for some time, despite the distraction of normal daily activities, detect and recognize the cue when it occurs, recall the medication and directions, and finally, take the medication as instructed (Woods et al. 2008). HIV-associated ProM impairment has emerged as a significant predictor of medication management, even after considering the contributions of other neuropsychological functions (Woods et al. 2008). Poor performances on tests of ProM have previously been correlated with reduced antiretroviral medication adherence (Contardo et al. 2009). ProM may also play a unique role in compliance with health care instructions for HIV disease management (Zogg et al. 2010). As ProM performance is unknown in the South African control population as well as in a South African HIV positive cohort, both event-based and time-based tasks were assessed in our study.\nNeuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate ProM in healthy adults. ProM tasks have shown a consistent pattern of hemodynamic activity in the anterior and lateral prefrontal cortex, while showing decreased hemodynamic activity of the medial prefrontal cortex in healthy controls (Simons et al. 2006). This is consistent with the hypothesis that anterior prefrontal cortex supports the biasing of attention between external events and internal cues. Burgess et al. showed that the bilateral activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, associated with retrieving a delayed intention, was accompanied by deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (Burgess et al. 2003). A study which focused on hemodynamic responses while keeping an intention in mind, while simultaneously performing a task which required responses to questions about intentions and actions, reported increased hemodynamic response in the lateral prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and precuneus (den Ouden et al. 2005). Similar increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were seen in the frontal pole bilaterally, right lateral prefrontal and inferior parietal regions when using positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate ProM (Burgess et al. 2001). An earlier PET study observed activations in the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, the left frontal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus, the left parahippocampal gyrus, and midline medial frontal lobe (Okuda et al. 1998). These activations could be due to several cognitive processes simultaneously involved in ProM, such as holding a future intention and dividing attention between the intention and the routine activity. Although several studies have examined ProM in healthy adults using fMRI and PET, this study is one of the first studies to examine the neural underpinnings of ProM in an adult clinical sample.\nGiven that white matter tracts from the prefrontal cortex are involved in HIV (Pomara et al. 2001), it may be hypothesized that in HIV positive individuals, damage to these tracts leads to ProM impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to derive measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusion (MD) in white matter tracts, which provides an indirect indication of the structural integrity of the regional white matter (Basser 1995). Previous studies using DTI, have demonstrated frontal and internal capsular damage in clinical studies of HIV-1 positive patients (Pomara et al. 2001). Significant relationships have been identified between FA and MD measures of subcortical structures in HIV positive individuals and verbal memory, visual memory and working memory (Ragin et al. 2005). Another study found that cognitive impairment in a HIV-infected group related to white matter injury in the internal capsule, corpus callosum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Gongvatana et al. 2009).\nAs such, preliminary evidence suggests that there is white matter involvement in HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HANDS), but as yet, no study of which we are aware has investigated the correlation with changes in white matter in HIV positive individuals and ProM. The study hypothesized that first; persons with HIV-1 infection in South Africa would demonstrate impaired ProM relative to demographically comparable healthy control comparison subjects. Second, that ProM functioning in HIV would correlate with performance on neuropsychological tests of executive functioning, information processing speed, learning, and working memory, but not with measures of retention or semantic memory. Third, those HIV-1-infected individuals with poor ProM would demonstrate white matter changes reflected as lower FA using DTI in anterior prefrontal cortical white matter regions",

      "text": "Participants (n0128) with HIV Stage III or Stage IV disease and healthy HIV negative controls (n032), all African aged 18-35 years were recruited from the Infectious Diseases Clinics within the Groote Schuur Hospital recruitment area. The protocol was approved in writing by the Committee for Human Research of the University of Cape Town. The mean CD4 count of the sample (n0120) was 193.61 (min07 and max0929). All potential participants were ambulant and able to attend out-patient visits. A study nurse screened clinic attendees who were about to initiate anti-retroviral medication, but were HAART naïve, randomly drawn from the days list on assigned days. To be eligible HIV positive participants were required to have a positive diagnosis of HIV infection made within the last 6 months (based on serologic testing by ELISA and Western blot) and have at least 6 years of formal education. No data was available on viral load and nadir CD4 counts. Hepatitis sero-status was not established but the prevalence of hepatitis C in South Africa is extremely low (Fernhaber et al. 2008). The language of testing was ideally Xhosa as all of the participants were Xhosa first-language speakers. However, occasionally a participant chose to be tested in English even though Xhosa was their first language. 68.8  of participants were tested in Xhosa, 23.1  were tested in English and 8.1  were tested in a mixture of Xhosa  English.\nThe presence of other current DSM-IV disorders as determined through semi-structured interviews using the MINI was an exclusion criterion. Patients were also excluded if they were using psychotropic medication or had a recent (6 month) substance abuse history as defined by responses to the Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory (AUDIT) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Screener (SAMISS). Individuals, who scored greater than 16 on the Beck Depression Inventory, were excluded from the study. Patients were also excluded if they reported a lifetime history of head injury or a current neurological disease or infection.\nControl data was obtained from 32 healthy participants. These healthy controls were recruited from Voluntary Counseling and Testing services at the same primary care clinics, thus potentially controlling for confounding variables such as socio economic status and risk taking behaviour. Other than being HIV negative, as confirmed by a recent rapid HIV test and confirmatory serological test, inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to HIV positive participants.",

The battery was adapted from that used by the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Centre, in San Diego. The battery has previously been used in studies of HIV positive patients in South Africa (Joska et al. 2010) Wechsler Memory Scale-Mental Control (WMS); Mental Alternation Test. Changes to word lists to reflect local language and idiom were made. All instruments had their instructions and content translated into isiXhosa and Afrikaans-instructions were also back-translated for fidelity. Raw scores were used for the analyses given that published norms from first-world populations are not suitable for use with this population (Joska et al. 2010). The raw scores were compared with scores of the controls.",

      "text": "ProM was assessed using a subjective self -report measure as well as objective measures. Self-reported ProM was assessed using the ProM Scale from the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) (Crawford et al. 2003). The objective measure consisted of both a time and an event based task. The instructions for the event based task were Later on, I am going to give you a name and address to write on the envelope. When you have finished doing this, I would like you to do the following: turn it over, seal it and write your initials on the back. Could you remember to do this then without me reminding you? This was followed by a delay interval of around 10 min which was filled with other cognitive tasks. The interviewer then observed whether the respondent carried out the prospective memory task. If the respondent did not do so within about 10 s, the interviewer prompted Were you going to do something else with the envelope If only one correct action was carried out (i.e. just the envelope sealed or just initial written on the back), the interviewer said Was there something else you were going to do. The time based task was taken from the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) (Raskin et al. 2011), which is a standardized laboratory measure of ProM with published evidence of its reliability and construct validity (Carey et al. 2006). The instruction was: In 2 min ask me when this session ends today. Prospective memory scores were totaled across the tasks. The scores of the tasks completed without prompt were doubled in order to form a Total Prospective Memory Index with a maximum possible score of 8.\nParticipants scored a 2 if they got the answer completely correct, a 1 if they got an answer partially correct and 0 if the answer was incorrect. If they had to be prompted, the scoring worked in the same way. For the purposes of the Total ProM score, those responses obtained without a prompt were doubled. Thereafter all responses were added to give a possible total score out of 8. Errors types, e.g. omissions or substitutions were not coded. The ProM tasks were inserted into a battery of tests which was administered in a standardized manner across participants. Each participant would therefore have completed the same filler tasks.",

Eddy correction was performed in FSL (Smith et al. 2006). In Matlab (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA), outliers were rejected by first calculating Z-scores based on 25 and 75 percentile limits, and then discarding data points more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. The three acquisitions were averaged and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images were generated. An affine and non-linear registration of the B0 images to each subjects T2 image (intra-subject) was performed and subsequent transformation parameters applied to FA. A mean FA template was then created from all the subjects followed by a final coregistration of the FA images to the mean template. The same procedure was followed for the MD images.\nComparisons within the HIV-positive scanned group (n0 40) groups (those with good and poor ProM) and the healthy controls were then drawn to examine the associations between HIV infection, ProM and white matter FA and MD. HIV positive participants who scored less than 4 out of a total score of 8 for the ProM tasks were defined as having poor ProM; as they were unable to complete any of the ProM tasks without prompting. Whole brain voxel analysis of FA and MD in the healthy control group was also compared to the HIVsubgroups (those with good and poor ProM).",

Descriptive statistics, ttests and Chi-square analyses, were performed to examine between-group differences on demographic variables of the large HIV positive sample (n0128) and the large healthy control sample (n 032). Furthermore, T-tests were performed to see whether there was any significant difference between the large groups (n0128 and n032) and the smaller scanned (n040 and n010) groups. Because of the nature of the scores (scalar), non-parametric tests were performed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess between-group differences on measures of ProM. The self-report measure of the PRMQ was correlated with the objective measures of ProM. In order to indicate which other cognitive domains bore the strongest relationship to ProM in the current sample, Spearmans rho correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between the ProM total score and scores on the rest of the neuropsychological battery.\nFor the DTI analyses two-tailed t-tests (p0.01, uncorrected, FA mask of 0.25) were conducted between HIVpositive groups (those with good and poor ProM). Each of the HIV-positive groups was also compared with healthy controls (p0.01, uncorrected, two-tailed t-test). These ttests were performed on both the FA and MD data. HIV positive participants who scored less than 4 out of a total score of 8 for the ProM tasks were grouped as having poor ProM; as they were unable to complete any of the tasks without prompting.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "One hundred and sixty participants (HIV positive n0128 and healthy controls n032) were included in the final analysis. HIV positive participants were young adults (mean 29.62 years, SD 3.59) and had some high school education (mean 10.07 years, SD 1.94). 33  of the HIV positive participants were male and 67  were female. The healthy control participants were slightly younger (mean 24.53 years, SD 5.99) and with a similar education level to the HIV positive participants (mean 10.66 years, SD 1.45). 39  of the control participants were male and 67  were female. The range of education was 6 to 13 years for both HIV positive and control participants.\nTotal prospective memory was significantly poorer in HIV positive group (n0128) group when compared with healthy controls (n032) (U09497.5; Z0-2.273; p00.023; r0.181). When analysing time and event based ProM separately: time-based ProM was poorer in the HIV positive group compared to healthy controls both without prompts (U09,349; Z-4.134; p0.001; r0.672) and with prompts (U01,871; Z0-3.384; p00.001; r0.732). The effect sizes for the time-based ProM were more than satisfactory. The event-based ProM tasks without and with prompt did not differentiate between HIV positive and healthy control groups.\nBecause of the significant difference in age between the HIV positive group (n0128) and the healthy controls (n0 32), a regression analysis was performed on the Total prospective memory score using demographic variables to see whether age was a significant predictor of prospective memory score. Age was not a significant predictor of total prospective memory scores, however education was significant (p0.001).\nDespite the fact that only time-based ProM tasks differed significantly between HIV positive (n0128) and healthy control participants (n032), it was decided to complete the remainder of the analyses using the Total ProM scores. Although the event-based ProM task was not statistically significant, the trend was the same for time-based and eventbased ProM.\nParticipants who scored less than 4 out of a total score of 8 for the ProM tasks were defined as having poor ProM; as they were unable to complete any of the ProM tasks without prompting. Using the goodpoor prospective memory distinction, 39.8  (n051) of HIV positive group had good prospective memory while 71.9  (n023) of the controls did. Similarly 60.2  (n077) of the HIV positive group had poor prospective memory while 28.1  (n09) of the controls did. See Table 1 The correlations between the Total Prospective Memory Summary score in the HIV positive participants (n0128) and the neuropsychological tests from the remainder of the battery are shown in Table 2. Tests of motor function, visual learning, and working memory, processing speed, executive function and word fluency domains had significant correlations with Total Prospective Memory Summary score. However on the semantic memory tests immediate and delayed verbal and visual retention were also correlated with Total ProM. Verbal learning was not significantly correlated with Total ProM.\nAnalysis demonstrates no relationship between cue type and CD4 counts. Total Prospective Memory score correlated poorly with the self -report PRMQ (Spearmans rho R0.073) Diffusion tensor imaging There were no statistically significant demographic or disease differences in the large HIV positive group (n0128) versus the smaller scanned HIV positive group (n040). In Participants who scored less than 4 out of a total score of 8 for the ProM tasks were defined as having poor ProM the large (n032) and small (n010) control groups there was no significant difference in terms of either education or age. Linear regression models were created for each area of the brain to see whether ProM was a significant predictor of FA values. ProM was a significant predictor of FA values in all the regions entered in to the analysis.\nOf the 40 HIV positive participants that were scanned 27 had poor ProM and 13 were assessed as having good ProM.\nThere was no significant difference between these groups in CD4 count and age, however education was significantly different (p00.009). Comparisons were performed to examine the effect of ProM on FA and MD. The healthy control group (n010) was compared to HIV participants with good ProM (n 013) and then again to those with poor ProM (n027). The final comparison was between the two HIV positive groups (i.e. good vs. poor ProM). When comparing healthy controls (n010) to HIV positive participants with poor ProM (n027) significant decreases in FA in the regions of the corpus collosum (p00.0029), the sagittal stratum (p0.0001) and the superior longitudinal fasiculus (p00.0062) were found. Increased FA in the Superior longitudinal fasciculus (left) in the HIV positive good ProM group (n013) compared to healthy controls (p00.0024) was found. Those HIV positive participants with poor ProM (n0 27) had significantly decreased FA in the regions of superior corona radiata (p00, 0035), the corpus collosum (p00.006) (Fig. 1) and the cingulum (p00.0033) (Fig. 2) when compared to those who were HIV positive with good ProM (n0 13). Complete FA results are summarized in Table 3. No differences were found in MD in the three comparisons.\nLinear regression models were created to determine the neuropsychological predictors of FA in the HIV positive cohort (n040). Given the significant difference in age between the healthy controls and the HIV positive participants, and the role that age pays in changes in the white matter, age was entered as a potential predictor in all of these models. However, it was not significant for any of the models. Colour trails II (β0.305, t02.151, p0.044), HVLT learning (β 0.425, t 03.458, p 0.002), and the Digit Symbol test (β0.415, t03.254, p0.004) were significant predictors of FA scores in the superior corona radiata. Semantic fluency (animals) (β0.493, t02.717, p0.012) was a significant predictor of FA scores in the Genu of the CC and in the cingulum (β0.432, t02.295, p0.031).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Consistent with our original hypotheses, first, results from the current study provide evidence of ProM impairment in HIV positive patients. Second, poor ProM functioning in HIV positive patients correlated with poor performance on The data here confirm previous work on ProM impairment in HIV. It is unlikely that findings from the current study are confounded by depressive symptoms or demographic factors such as level of education, as the HIV positive and healthy control groups were comparable on years of education, and sex. In a previous study the HIV positive sample demonstrated deficits in time-and eventbased ProM, however we found that only time-based and total ProM, not event based ProM, discriminated between HIV positive and healthy control participants. The sample size in our study is larger, or this may be due to differences in assessment of ProM. It has been hypothesized that timebased tasks require slightly different cognitive processes than event-based tasks (i.e., a greater emphasis on selfinitiated monitoring and retrieval), and empirical evidence suggests that the former are generally more sensitive in older adults (Einstein and McDaniel 1990) and traumatic brain injury samples (Cockburn 1996). Specific correlations were observed between the Total Prospective Memory score and tests of executive functioning, information processing speed and verbal working memory within the HIV positive sample. This is not surprising given either previous literature, or the relationship ProM has to these cognitive domains. People infected with HIV often exhibit dysfunction in the executive aspects memory tasks (Carey et al. 2006). Difficulties in executive function include a disorganized plan for retrieving the correct information from episodic memory stores and would manifest in poor ProM performance (Carey et al. 2006). Nevertheless, a previous study of ProM in HIV, with a smaller sample size, found that ProM performance did not correlate with measures of semantic memory, retention, or recognition discrimination. However consistent with previous literature verbal fluency and HVLT recognition and recall did not discriminate well between HIV positive participants and controls (Stout et al. 1995).\nThe PRMQ has previously not reliably identified HIVassociated neurocognitive impairment and was therefore not recommended as a rapid screening tool for this purpose (Garvey et al. 2009). In a study of ProM, an HIV positive sample was impaired relative to the seronegative group on an objective, performance-based ProM test; however selfreported ProM complaints did not correspond to actual ProM abilities (Woods et al. 2007). Previous findings on the relationship between subjective and objective measures of cognitive performance suggest a relatively weak association in healthy volunteers (Broadbent et al. 1982). In our study PRMQ scores correlated poorly with Total Prospective Memory score. The underlying relationship between awareness of prospective memory impairment in HIV infection is unknown.\nResults of the present study using DTI to contrast HIV positive participants with poor ProM to HIV positive participants with good ProM, confirm our hypothesis in which we anticipated changes associated with poor ProM in white matter tracts that relay through the anterior prefrontal cortical regions including the genu of the corpus callosum, the cingulum (near the hippocampus) and the superior corona radiata. The function of the genu of the corpus callosum relates to tests of executive functioning and working memory which correlated with ProM functioning in our sample. These findings provide evidence that the poor ProM is associated with neural changes induced by HIV. In keeping with these findings HIV associated ProM impairment has previously been associated with higher levels of CSF tau, a marker of axonal injury (Woods et al. 2006). Deficits in ProM are in keeping with the predominant fronto-striatal neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 disease (Carey et al. 2006). ProM requires retrospective memory (and thereby medial temporal and limbic structures such as the hippocampus). This is consistent with the neuropsychological findings that failures in retrospective recall (i.e., forgetting the content of an intention) will result in ProM failure (Burgess et al. 2001). Colour trails 12, HVLT learning, the Digit Symbol test and semantic fluency predicted reduced FA in the superior corona radiata and semantic fluency in the corpus callosum and cingulum, suggesting that these neuropsychological tests may be sensitive to white matter damage in HIV.\nLimitations of our study are that our healthy control group is small and thus it is possible that our sample may not be accurately representing the ProM functioning and white matter integrity of our healthy population at large. Our data are cross-sectional and as such are not able to address the question of whether white matter changes noted in participants with poor ProM represent an early marker of subsequent cognitive decline. Our assessment of ProM comprised of only one time-based and one event based task. A more comprehensive objective assessment of ProM such as the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) may provide a more accurate assessment of ProM functioning in our population. However adaptation of the MIST to Xhosa language as well as a review of whether tasks are culturally relevant would be necessary before the tool could be used in South Africa.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "Despite these limitations this is the first study of which we are aware which has shown changes in white matter associated with ProM in HIV positive participants. The prevalence of ProM impairment in our HIV positive sample potentially carries profound clinical implications in terms of their possible impact on independent living skills and the risk of nonadherence to complex antiretroviral medication regimens (Woods et al. 2008). Such findings imply that assessment and consideration of the ProM deficits associated with HIV infection might be useful in the day-to-day management of the disease. For example medication adherence efforts might also be enhanced by keeping to a minimum the number and complexity of tasks to be completed. Future research could focus on intervention strategies for persons infected with HIV who have poor ProM, and on longitudinal study designs that may identify ProM as a reliable early correlate of risk for subsequent cognitive dysfunction in HIV, or DTI predictions of everyday functioning outcomes. Studies might also examine the association between ProM performance and multimodal neuroimaging associations in HIV-1 infection.",

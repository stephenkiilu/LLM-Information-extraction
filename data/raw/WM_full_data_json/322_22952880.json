    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography (FT) is the most popular approach for investigating white matter tracts in vivo, despite its inability to reconstruct fiber pathways in regions with crossing fibers. Recently, constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has been developed to mitigate the adverse effects of crossing fibers on DTI based FT. Notwithstanding the methodological benefit, the clinical relevance of CSD based FT for the assessment of white matter abnormalities remains unclear. In this work, we evaluated the applicability of a hybrid framework, in which CSD based FT is combined with conventional DTI metrics to assess white matter abnormalities in 25 patients with early Alzheimers disease. Both CSD and DTI based FT were used to reconstruct two white matter tracts: one with regions of crossing fibers, i.e., the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and one which contains only one fiber orientation, i.e. the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum (CC). The DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), obtained from these tracts were related to memory function. Our results show that in the tract with crossing fibers the relation between FAMD and memory was stronger with CSD than with DTI based FT. By contrast, in the fiber bundle where one fiber population predominates, the relation between FAMD and memory was comparable between both tractography methods. Importantly, these associations were most pronounced after adjustment for the planar diffusion coefficient, a measure reflecting the degree of fiber organization complexity. These findings indicate that compared to conventionally applied DTI based FT, CSD based FT combined with DTI metrics can increase the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in tracts with complex white matter architecture.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography (FT) is currently the most widely used method to reconstruct fiber pathways in the brain, despite its well known limitations in regions with complex white matter architecture 123. The common second-rank diffusion tensor model, however, is based on the assumption of Gaussian diffusion, which may not be valid in white matter voxels that contain so-called crossing fibers 4, i.e. complex fiber bundle architecture within a single voxel including two or more crossing, interdigitating or kissing fiber populations, or one fiber population with a bending or splaying architecture.\nIn the past decade, several advanced approaches for characterizing the intra-voxel diffusion profile have been developed to overcome the limitations of the second-rank diffusion tensor model 567891011. One of these techniques, constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) 9, is especially promising as it can offer a reliable reconstruction of multiple fiber orientation distributions within clinically feasible MR acquisition settings 8. Notwithstanding the promising outlook, the CSD model has not yet been applied quantitatively to clinical populations due to the lack of robust diffusion metrics that can describe the underlying microstructure unambiguously.\nWe hypothesize that if CSD based FT is more accurate in reconstructing fiber bundle trajectories in regions with crossing fibers, it should be more sensitive to microstructural abnormalities underlying cognitive dysfunction than DTI based FT in these tracts. In tracts without crossing fiber regions, both methods should perform equally. To test this hypothesis we used a hybrid framework, in which CSD based FT is combined with conventional DTI metrics to assess white matter abnormalities in patients with early Alzheimers disease (AD). This allowed us to examine the microstructural properties of specific white matter pathways in relation to memory performance, while overcoming the wellknown limitations of DTI based FT in regions with crossing fibers. We evaluated this CSD-DTI framework for two white matter tracts: one specifically selected because it contains many regions of crossing fibers, i.e. the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and one with only one fiber orientation, i.e. the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum (CC). Diffusion measures in these tracts have been previously shown to be altered in patients with AD compared to controls using tract based analyses 12 and to the AD-associated impairments in memory function 13.\nIn this paper, we examined whether CSD based FT combined with DTI metrics can increase the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in tracts with complex white matter architecture compared to conventionally applied DTI based FT.",

    "Tractography": {
      "text": "Standard deterministic streamline DTI 24 and standard CSD 25 based tractography were performed with the ExploreDTI software package (www.exploredti.com). We reconstructed the SLF and the CC using both FT methods with a uniform seed point resolution of 2 mm 3 and a maximum deflection angle of 30 degrees. For the DTI based FT an FA threshold of 0.2 was applied. Analogously, the applied termination threshold for CSD based FT was a fiber orientation distribution (FOD) value of 0.1 (the harmonic degree of the estimated FOD coefficients was limited to 6) 8. For this study we selected fiber tracts that were previously shown to be affected in MCI and AD 12,13,26 and either have a complex fiber architecture with crossing fibers or a single fiber population without crossing fibers. The SLF contains a relatively large number of voxels with multiple fiber orientations due to the crossing of the corona radiata andor laterally projecting fibers of the CC and is therefore particularly susceptible to tracking errors caused by the second-rank diffusion tensor model 25. By contrast, the midsagittal section of the CC contains mainly voxels with one fiber population and is expected to be less vulnerable to tracking errors.\nThe SLF, including SLF II, III and the arcuate fasciculus 27, was reconstructed from the left hemisphere (all participants were right handed) based on a standardized atlas of white matter tracts 28. For reconstruction of the SLF, a multiple region of interest (ROI) selection approach was used. In total, three AND ROIs were placed, two on a coronal and one on a sagittal slice (see Figure 1). In this ROI protocol, previously defined anatomical landmarks for slice selection and ROI placement were used to reduce subjectivity in fiber tracking 28. High intra-and interrater reliability of manually segmenting fiber bundles has been demonstrated in previous studies (e.g. 293031).\nThe CC was reconstructed as described previously 32. In summary, only the midsagittal segment of the CC was selected to exclude regions of crossing fibers from the more laterally projecting pathways of the CC that intersect the corticospinal fiber trajectories (Figure 2). Note that as all data were analyzed in MNI space, the midsagittal slice could be determined reliably in all subjects.\nDiffusion parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (DR), axial diffusivity (DA), and the normalized planar diffusion coefficient (l 2 2l 3 l 1 ) 33 were obtained for each tract. The planar diffusion coefficient was used to quantify the degree of fiber complexity in regions with crossing fibers 33,34. The planar diffusion coefficient ranges from zero to one and is relatively high in voxels where the tensor has a disclike shape (i.e. the first and second eigenvalue are almost equal and larger than the third eigenvalue). This is typically the case when two fiber populations cross or kiss 34353637 (Figures 3, 4, and5). It is important to note, that although the planar diffusion coefficient and FA or MD are both an index of the tensor shape, they are not directly related: the FA can be similar in voxels with linear or planar diffusion 38. By contrast, the planar diffusion coefficient provides a geometric description of the tensor and hence is more specific to the fiber configuration 34.",

The white line marks a sub-region of the SLF containing voxels with relatively few crossing fibers, which is reflected by a Cp close to zero.

This is reflected by a Cp closer to one. doi:10.1371journal.pone.0044074.g004 assessed in regions with crossing fibers.

As such, we limited the adverse effect of crossing fibers on the relation between DTI metrics (i.e. FA, MD, DR, DA) and cognition. This modulating effect is expected to be most pronounced in combination with CSD based FT in tracts with crossing fibers, since more voxels with crossing fibers will be included using this method.\nTo examine the possibility that the relation between diffusion measures and memory performance is affected by tract volume 43, we ran a separate model with age, sex, education level and estimated tract volume as covariates.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This is the first report on the application of CSD based FT to detect white matter abnormalities in patients with (early) AD. Our results indicate that 1) CSD based FT in combination with DTI metrics significantly increased the sensitivity to detect a relation between white matter abnormalities and memory performance in a tract with crossing fibers (SLF); and 2) the relation between DTI metrics and memory was comparable between both FT methods in a tract without crossing fibers (midsagittal section of the CC).\nIn line with our expectations, fibers of the SLF were more likely to terminate in regions with crossing fibers with DTI-based FT. By contrast, with CSD based FT the SLF continued beyond these crossings to more temporal and dorsal frontal regions, which is in line with descriptions from autopsy studies 27,44 and with previous papers using spherical deconvolution based FT 45. Our results extend these findings by showing that improvement of fiber tract segmentation increases the sensitivity to white matter abnormalities within the tract.\nThe adverse effects of crossing fibers on the interpretation of diffusion measures such as MD and FA have been previously demonstrated (e.g. 35,41,42), but their impact on the detection of white matter abnormalities is not known. A number of studies have found contra-intuitive results in regions with crossing fibers, such as the centrum semiovale, demonstrating increased FA values in patients compared to controls 46,47 and a negative correlation between FA and cognitive function 48,49. These unexpected findings may result from degeneration of one pathway, with relatively sparing of the crossing pathway. For example in AD, late-myelinating white matter tracts such as the SLF have been shown to degenerate at an earlier stage than tracts that myelinate early in life 50,51. This is supported by results from a recent study showing an increased mode of anisotropy in patients with MCI compared to controls only in areas where the SLF intersects the projection pathways 46. Voxels with crossing fibers are more likely to be included with CSD based FT. We therefore used the planar diffusion coefficient as a covariate to overcome the confounding effects of these crossing fibers on the diffusion metrics in relation to cognition. If two fiber populations within voxel cross or kiss, the shape of the diffusion tensor becomes more planar (disc-like). As a result, a voxel with intact crossing fibers can have a similar FA value compared to a voxel with a degenerating non-crossing fiber population. However, the planar diffusion coefficient between these voxels will be different 38. Our results showed that covarying for the planar diffusion coefficient effectively increased the strength of the relation between DTI metrics in the SLF and memory performance. As expected, this modulation was most pronounced in combination with CSD based FT. Adjusting for the planar diffusion coefficient also increased the association between DTI metrics and memory in the CC, despite the lack of any interdigitating fiber pathways. Possibly, this finding can be explained by the presence of residual partial volume effects between the dorsal part of the CC and the adjacent cingulum bundles. Partial volume effects also affect the tensor estimation and the measures derived from it 34,35 and may therefore confound the relation between DTI metrics and cognition in the same way.\nThe effects of DTI metrics on cognitive performance were more prominent for DR than for DA, suggesting that the observed association is more likely driven by myelodegeneration than by a loss of axonal integrity 52. However, it should be noted that many more cellular characteristics, such as hydration, cell packing density and fiber diameter could cause the observed changes in diffusion measures 535455 and that the interpretation of these diffusivity measures can be far from trivial 41.\nOur study has a number of limitations. One is the modest sample size, which may have decreased our sensitivity to detect a relation between structure and function. Still, we were able to replicate previously observed associations between diffusion measures and AD severity 56,57. Second, FT based segmentation is laborious and time consuming. However, the advantage over automated voxel based or atlas based analyses is that it is less sensitive to individual anatomical differences, imperfect registration, and smoothing errors 585960. Moreover, averaging of the diffusion metrics along a fiber bundle reduces the variance in diffusion measures and thereby increases the power to detect more subtle WM changes. On the other hand, very localized changes along a fiber bundle, for instance, only in the structures anterior part, may not be picked up when the anterior and posterior parts are combined. To limit the number of comparisons we focused in the present study on two major tracts, but future studies should demonstrate whether these findings extend to other fiber pathways containing complex and simple white matter architecture known to be affected in AD 61 or other neurological diseases.\nFinally, the use of the planar diffusion coefficient as a quantitative measure to characterize crossing fibers may be valid in cases were two fiber bundles intersect or overlap, but may not be directly applicable in regions where three or more fiber bundles intersect. Although previous work reported that no more than two fiber populations could be observed in the SLF 62, there is still no consensus on the prevalence of multiple fiber populations 4. In this context, future studies are needed to investigate this issue in detail and more specific measures for crossing fibers need to be developed to improve the sensitivity for detecting white matter abnormalities in clinical populations and to make the interpretation of structure-function relationships less ambiguous.",

The use of a hybrid CSD-DTI framework is therefore a promising tool to detect functionally significant white matter changes in regions with complex white matter architecture.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0-10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance-based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract-based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.",

      "text": "The prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle among children is rapidly increasing (Gabel et al., 2016;Tremblay et al., 2011). This trend is especially worrisome in light of evidence indicating that physical activity leads to a wide range of physical benefits, such as reduced risks for cardiovascular disease and obesity, and increased bone health (Janssen  LeBlanc, 2010). Moreover, recent evidence also indicates that engagement in physical activity is related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children, in particular concerning executive functioning (de Greeff et al., 2018;Donnelly et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2018;Vazou et al., 2019). Executive functions, such as working memory and inhibition, facilitate goal directed behavior (Collins  Koechlin, 2012;Salthouse, 2005) and are important predictors of behavioral functioning, academic achievement, and even social well-being, health, wealth, and quality of life (Diamond  Lee, 2011).\nPhysical activity induced changes in brain structure and functioning are thought to be instrumental in the beneficial effects of physical activity on behavioral measures of neurocognitive functioning.\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis concerning the effects of physical activity on brain structure and neurophysiological functioning support the idea that physical activity indeed has beneficial effects on neurophysiological functioning in children, while little is known about the effects of physical activity on brain structure in children (Meijer, Königs, Vermeulen, et al., 2020;Valkenborghs et al., 2019). Of the few studies into the effects of physical activity on brain structure in children, all focused on white matter microstructure (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2018;Hyde et al., 2009;Krafft et al., 2014;Schaeffer et al., 2014). White matter microstructure facilitates the structural connectivity of the brain to allow functional integration of processes originating from specialized brain areas (Park  Friston, 2013). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the assessment white matter microstructure by quantification of water molecule diffusion characteristics (Le Bihan et al., 2001). The most commonly used DTI measure is fractional anisotropy (FA), which is considered to be higher in tightly bundled, structurally compact fibers with high integrity (Beaulieu, 2002). Other DTI parameters are axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), possible markers for axonal density (Song et al., 2003) and myelination (Song et al., 2002), respectively. Although DTI parameters are measures of water diffusion and thus indirect measures of structural connectivity (Jones et al., 2013), a profile of higher FA and AD and lower RD is thought to be compatible with higher white matter integrity.\nDevelopmental studies demonstrate age-related increases in FA in most white matter regions until the late adolescence (Lebel et al., 2008;Peters et al., 2012). Hence, white matter microstructure may be particularly sensitive for physical activity during the window of strong brain development in childhood and adolescence. This idea is supported by a recent study indicating that physical activity (sports participation and outdoor play time) is associated with higher FA in healthy preadolescent children (Rodriguez-Ayllon, Derks, et al., 2020). Moreover, cardiovascular fitness (Esteban-Cornejo et al., 2019) and motor skills (Langevin et al., 2014) seems to be also associated with white matter microstructure in children.\nCardiovascular fitness and motor skills are strongly related to physical activity exposure (Aires et al., 2010;Stodden et al., 2008) and physical activity is considered as an important determinant of cardiovascular fitness levels and motor skill development during childhood and adolescence (Aires et al., 2010;Ortega et al., 2008;Sallis et al., 1997;Stodden et al., 2008). Taken together, this suggests that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to white matter microstructure in children and that this relationship may be influenced by the exposure to physical activity.\nMost research concerning the relationship between physical activity and white matter microstructure has focused on cardiovascular fitness (Meijer, Königs, Vermeulen, et al., 2020). The level of cardiovascular fitness is determined by long-term physical activity at moderate to high intensity (Rowland, 2007) in combination with physical maturation (Haywood  Getchell, 2019) and genetic factors (Malina et al., 2004). Long-term physical activity is associated with an increased release of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neural growth factor) and with both increased neural blood vessel formation and neurogenesis (Colcombe et al., 2006;Dishman et al., 2006;Swain et al., 2003). These neural mechanisms are known to promote plasticity in the structure and function of brain areas that support neurocognitive functioning (Vaynman  Gomez-Pinilla, 2006). Accordingly, cross-sectional studies using DTI indicate that higher levels of cardiovascular fitness are related to higher FA in healthy and obese adults and elderly (Johnson et al., 2012;Marks et al., 2011;Opel et al., 2019). More specifically, positive associations were found for cardiovascular fitness and FA (Johnson et al., 2012;Marks et al., 2011;Opel et al., 2019), while a negative relation was found with RD and no association between cardiovascular fitness and AD (Johnson et al., 2012). Very few studies have been conducted in children (Meijer, Königs, Vermeulen, et al., 2020). However, the available studies show that higher cardiovascular fitness is related to greater FA in healthy preadolescent children (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2014) and greater FA and lower AD and RD in adolescents (Ruotsalainen et al., 2020).

      "text": "This is the first study to investigate the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in children. This study shows that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills relate to white matter microstructure, while no evidence was found for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. This study adds to the cumulating evidence that physical activity exposure in childhood contributes to brain development, potentially through changes in cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill development.\ncontrast, the study by Rodriguez-Ayllon, Esteban-Cornejo, et al. (2020) did not find a significant relationship between cardiovascular fitness and FA in obese children. In addition, long-term intervention studies indicate effects of aerobic exercise programs on white matter microstructure in healthy children (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2018), obese children (Krafft et al., 2014), and deaf children (Xiong et al., 2018). Results indicate increased FA (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2018;Krafft et al., 2014), as well as decreased FA (Xiong et al., 2018) and RD (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2018) and no changes in AD (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2018;Krafft et al., 2014). These findings support a causal role of physical activity, targeting cardiovascular fitness, in white matter microstructure.\nAn alternative or complementary pathway for physical activity induced changes in brain structure is motor skill development (Voss, 2016). Development of complex motor skills is thought to enhance axonal arborization and increase cell density in white matter structures that are involved in motor functioning (Jones et al., 1999).\nIndeed, a study in child musicians has indicated that better fine motor skills are related to enhanced FA in specific white matter tracts compared to children who did not play music instruments (Bengtsson et al., 2005). Furthermore, intervention studies in adults indicate that gross motor skill training (practice juggling or balancing) leads to increased FA (Scholz et al., 2009;Taubert et al., 2010). Learning of novel complex motor skills, which require swift responses and tax concentration, appeals to both motor and cognitive functioning and enhanced functional connectivity is observed among the brain structures involved (Desmond et al., 1997;Diamond, 2000). In line with this finding gross motor skills, requiring control over large body muscles involved in balance, limb, and trunk movements, seem closely related to executive functioning in children (van der Fels et al., 2015(van der Fels et al., , 2019)). Taken together, the literature indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills may contribute to the changes in white matter microstructure in children that could benefit neurocognitive functioning.\nTo gain more knowledge on the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning, and between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning, it is important to determine whether induced white matter changes indeed go hand in hand with better neurocognitive functioning. Among the already small number of studies focusing on the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and white matter microstructure, and between motor skills and white matter microstructure, there are only four studies that also included measurements of neurocognitive functioning. One study in adults, showed that white matter microstructure, as assessed by FA, mediates the association between cardiovascular fitness (walking endurance) and cognitive performance (Opel et al., 2019). Another study in adolescents showed that FA of the corpus callosum and the right superior corona radiata mediates the association between of aerobic fitness with working memory (Ruotsalainen et al., 2020).\nThe other two studies were conducted in obese and deaf children, respectively, and showed that the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise programs on FA were paralleled by improvements in executive functioning (Krafft et al., 2014;Xiong et al., 2018). Although these findings support the idea that white matter microstructure is involved in the relation between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning, the findings are based on only four studies, with only two studies in small samples of children, all from clinical populations. Therefore, the generalizability of these findings to healthy children remains unknown. Furthermore, all of the existing studies focused on cardiovascular fitness, with no work being performed on motor skill development.\nThe present study aims to investigate the relationships of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with (a) neurocognitive functioning and (b) white matter microstructure and (c) whether white matter microstructure mediates the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. White matter microstructure as defined by FA, AD, and RD was assessed using DTI in combination with tract-based spatial statistics and neurocognitive functioning was assessed using a comprehensive and well-defined set of neurocognitive function measures targeting executive functions. Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that higher levels of cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are be associated with higher levels of neurocognitive functioning and higher FA (presumably accompanied by a profile of higher AD and lower RD). Furthermore, the relation between cardiovascular fitness or gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning is expected to be mediated by white matter microstructure.",

The timing of the auditory signal is initially set at a required average speed of 8 kmh, and is manipulated each minute to increase the required speed by 0.5 kmh at a time. The test was terminated when a child failed to reach the required distance in time on two consecutive crossings of the track.

First, we investigated the associations between cardiovascular fitness and the neurocognitive functioning components, and gross motor skills and the neurocognitive functioning components. These relations were examined using linear regression analyses in which the neurocognitive functioning components (resulting from the principal component analysis) were used as dependent variables and either cardiovascular fitness or gross motor skills were included as predictor. Demographic variables (sex, grade 3 or 4, age, BMI, and SES) were selected in each model as covariates using a stepwise backward selection approach, providing a data-driven selection of relevant covariates for each dependent variable.\nSecond, we investigated the role of white matter microstructure in the observed (significant) relationships between cardiovascular fitness and the neurocognitive functioning components, and gross motor skills and the neurocognitive functioning components.\nTherefore, we performed spatial regressions between the relevant neurocognitive functioning component scores and FA in the white matter skeleton using one-sided permutation testing in FSL Randomise, where threshold-free cluster enhancement and p values as corrected for family-wise error accounted for multiple testing (Winkler et al., 2014). White matter regions showing a significant relationship between one or more of the neurocognitive functioning components and FA, were selected as region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. Within these ROIs, we investigated the relation between cardiovascular fitness and FA, and gross motor skills and FA by performing spatial regression using two-sided permutation testing with FSL Randomise. If cardiovascular fitness andor gross motor skills were significantly associated with FA, we further explored the identity of this effect by extracting the AD and RD values in these ROIs. To control for possible effects of demographic variables, the covariates: sex, age, BMI, and SES were added to the models. Only significant covariates were retained in the final model.

The results\nshow that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning and white matter microstructure which in turn was shown to be related to neurocognitive functioning. However, no evidence was found for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning.\nThese findings support the idea that physical activity may induce changes in white matter microstructure that benefit neurocognitive functioning in childhood.\nThe results of the current study in a sample of healthy children revealed positive relations between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning as well as between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning. More specifically, we found that higher levels of cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were associated with better neurocognitive functioning as measured in terms of the speed and variability of information processing and motor response inhibition (Information Processing and Control). In addition, better gross motor skills were also related to better visuospatial working memory. These results are partly in line with earlier studies and recent meta-analyses, which also found associations between cardiovascular fitness and interference control and attention (de Greeff et al., 2018;Donnelly et al., 2016). Although the relationship between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning in children has thus far not received much attention, earlier research indicated positive associations with visuospatial working memory and attention (van der Fels et al., 2015). We argue that one compelling explanation for the discrepant findings between our and previous studies with regard to the specific neurocognitive functions that are related to cardiovascular fitness or gross motor skills, may stem from the fact that the current study corrected for processing speed in the assessment of executive functions (also see Meijer, Königs, de Bruijn, et al., 2020). In the current study, analysis carefully corrected for processing speed and revealed no evidence for relations with interference control, contrasting earlier findings that did not correct for processing speed (de Greeff et al., 2018;Donnelly et al., 2016). However, our findings did replicate the relations between cardiovascular fitness and information processing and motor response inhibition (Donnelly et al., 2016) Analyses focusing on white matter microstructure parameters (FA, AD, and RD) revealed that higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were related to higher FA, predominantly in the corpus callosum. More specifically, the ROIs for cardiovascular fitness were located in the bilateral splenium and the left body of the corpus callosum and for gross motor skills in both the left splenium and the right posterior corona radiata which connects the cerebral cortex and the brain stem and communicates motor and sensory information. Our findings concerning cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills were both located in the splenium, which is part of the forceps major, a white matter tract which connects temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical regions and is involved in the communication of somatosensory information (Caminiti et al., 2009;Hofer  Frahm, 2006;Wakana et al., 2004). The fact that our findings were obtained in the splenium might reflect functional importance of the splenium in the relation between physical activity and neurocognitive functioning.\nAlternatively, local anatomical properties of the splenium (e.g., density of the white matter fibers) may increase the sensitivity of this structure to detect relations between white matter microstructure and cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills (Hofer  Frahm, 2006). The profile of relations with DTI parameters (positive relations to FA and negative relations to RD) suggests that higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills are related to more tightly packed bundles and structurally compact fibers (FA) and increased myelination (RD). Furthermore, we observed higher AD which might reflect greater axonal fiber density andor diameter.\nOur findings concerning the relation between both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with white matter microstructure are in line with earlier work in healthy and clinical samples of children, adolescents, adults and elderly, indicating that higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills are related to increased FA in presumably the corpus callosum and corona radiata (Bengtsson et al., 2005;Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2014, 2018;Johnson et al., 2012;Krogsrud et al., 2018;Marks et al., 2011;Opel et al., 2019). However, our results concerning cardiovascular fitness are in contrast with the results of a recent cross-sectional study which indicated no significant relationship between physical fitness and FA (Rodriguez-Ayllon, Esteban-Cornejo, et al., 2020).\nAn important difference between their and our study is that Rodriguez-Ayllon and colleagues included only obese children, which may indicate that the association between cardiovascular fitness and white matter microstructure may differ between healthy and clinical populations. However, it is currently unknown whether the proposed underlying mechanisms linking cardiovascular fitness to white matter microstructure may act similarly in obese children (or other clinical groups) and healthy children (Meijer, Königs, Vermeulen, et al., 2020). Future research may further clarify the possible differences between healthy and clinical populations.\nLastly, we investigated the potential mediating role of white matter in the observed relation between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning and between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning. We found neither evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning, nor between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning. These findings contrast with earlier studies of Opel et al. (2019) andRuotsalainen et al. (2020) in adults and adolescents, which both indicated a mediating role of FA in the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and executive functioning. These contradictory results could be explained by the idea that white matter plasticity is age dependent and that during adolescence and young adulthood white matter microstructure is more sensitive for physical activity-induced effects than during preadolescence. However, we did find strong relationships for both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with FA in the same brain structures. Furthermore, the mediation effect of FA in the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and neurocognitive functioning and between gross motor skills and neurocognitive functioning just escaped conventional levels of significance. Thus, with a larger sample size and greater statistical power, the mediation analyses might have revealed significant mediating effects.\nOur findings should be interpreted within the knowledge that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill are related constructs (Reeves et al., 1999;Stodden et al., 2009). However, an exploratory analysis showed that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills were only modestly related in our sample (r  0.45, p  0.001, shared variance: 20). When repeating our analyses concerning the association with neurocognitive functioning and include both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills within the same model, we replicated the reported association between gross motor skills and the neurocognitive component Information Processing and Control (p  0.001). Hence, the potential contributions of cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill do not have to be mutually exclusive and may be complementary in their influence on brain structure and neurocognitive functioning. Future research may further clarify the relative contributions of aspects of physical activity of potential changes in brain structure.\nOur study has some important strengths, such as the relatively large sample size of healthy children and the use of a well-defined set of neurocognitive function measures. In addition, the current study is the first study to investigate the role of white matter microstructure in the two proposed pathways through which physical activity is thought to induce changes in neurocognitive functioning. This study also has some limitations. We included only children from 8 to 10 years old, restricting the generalizability of our findings to other stages of childhood development. Due to the rapid proliferation of executive functioning during childhood, it is highly possible that the effects of cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills depend on the childs developmental stage (Haywood  Getchell, 2019). Due to practical reasons, we scanned at two locations with scanners from different vendors. Accordingly, we have matched scanning protocols and included scanning site as covariate in all analyses. All DTI images were acquired with isotropic resolution, which were interpolated during reconstruction only in-plane. This led to anisotropic voxels as input In conclusion, the present study shows that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are associated with enhanced performance in a specific set of neurocognitive functions (i.e., relating to the speed and variability of information processing and motor response inhibition) as well as enhanced FA in a cluster of white matter tracts with overlapping relevance for neurocognitive functions (i.e., predominantly in the corpus callosum and corona radiata). Although white matter microstructure could not be indicated as a mediator in the relationship in both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning, our findings do support the idea that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill are related to white matter microstructure which in turn was shown to be related to neurocognitive functioning in healthy children.",

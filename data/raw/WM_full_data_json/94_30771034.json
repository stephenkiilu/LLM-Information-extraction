      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 30,000 people in the United States alone, with no effective therapeutic strategies available to cure or slow disease progression at present 1,2. Major HD clinical symptoms include movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits, which result from mutations in the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which causes expansion of a polyglutamine region in the encoded mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) 3,4. mHTT is toxic to medium spiny neurons in the striatum and cortical pyramidal neurons in patients affected with HD 4,5. The disease affects the whole brain with the most damage occurring in the basal ganglia, which plays a key role in coordinating movement and behavior. Although there is no cure for HD, advances in diagnosis and the management of symptoms rely on the availability of animal models.\nSeveral rodent models display the principal HD symptoms, and they are the focus of research investigations into the pathogenic mechanisms of HD 6. Among the various rodent models available 6, the R62 mouse-expressing mHTT from the human HTT gene -is the most widely used 7. The R62 mouse displays an early onset of the cognitive, behavioral, and locomotor HD symptoms (day 80) in the absence of overt cell death 8,9. Accordingly, pathological and experimental data established HD as a dying back neuropathy, where synaptic dysfunction and axonal degeneration represent early pathogenic events 4. Direct evidence supporting this notion was obtained using YFP-R62 reporter mice, which feature fluorescently labeled HD-vulnerable cortical projection neurons in the corpus callosum 10. In addition, in this work, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed a reduction in the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum of R62 mice (P30 days) before the onset of motor symptoms, an observation consistent with results from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in presymptomatic HD patients 11121314. Collectively, these findings highlight the need for additional brain imaging procedures that follow axonal degeneration in HD throughout the entire time course of the disease.\nA number of diffusion-weighted imaging approaches (intra-voxel incoherent motion 15, kurtosis imaging 16, and multi-shell DTI models 17) have been used to evaluate the subvoxel structure of the microporous white and gray matter of the brain. However, with the exception of kurtosis imaging, these techniques use low-to-medium amounts of diffusion-weighting (b values, typically less than 1000 smm 2 ) that investigate Gaussian or normal diffusion. Recently, higher ranges of b values have been used to examine non-Gaussian, socalled, anomalous diffusion (AD) models. Here, we will focus on the continuous time random walk (CTRW) model of diffusion that extends conventional Brownian motion by allowing the water molecule to be trapped (sub-diffusion) or released (super-diffusion), as it explores its local environment 18. The CTRW model encodes this exploration in terms of the diffusion parameters (α, β, D α,β ), which have been shown to exhibit contrast in diffusion studies of normal 18,19 and diseased 202122 brain tissue, e.g., they revealed sub-voxel changes in the brain 232425.\nThe CTRW model complements the standard DTI model in two ways. First, while DTI describes diffusion anisotropy by applying gradients in many directions at b values less than 1000 mm 2 s, CTRW focuses on compartmental complexity in a few gradient directions with b values typically greater than 2000 mm 2 s. DTI is excellent at describing orthotropic tissues such as brain white matter and skeletal muscle, in situations, where the diffusion is generally Gaussian; CTRW is sensitive to sub-voxel structure through a statistical assignment of particle waiting times and jump displacements that generalize normal Brownian motion to anomalous diffusion. Biological tissue heterogeneity leads to restricted diffusion at intermediate length scales (micron-to-millimeter lengths), where intra-and extra-cellular structures trap water in organelles, between membranes, and throughout the network of fibers that organize cell molecular traffic. Local tissue perfusion in and around capillaries and active transport within axons is captured in the CTRW model by the assignment of rare, but large particle displacements.\nIn this study, we investigate the sensitivity of the CTRW parameters as biomarkers for HD and use optical microscopy to identify the structural basis of the underlying tissue changes. We first describe how we acquired ultra-high field (17.6 T) diffusion-weighted images of fixed mouse brains (ex vivo) from control (wild-type mice) and diseased (symptomatic R62 HD mice) animals. Then, we outline how the multi-directional, multiple b value images were analyzed using the standard DTI diffusion model (diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) and an anomalous diffusion non-Gaussian model (fractional-order and diffusion biomarkers). We next present results comparing DTI and anomalous diffusion models in regions of the corpus callosum known to be affected at the early stages of HD in R62 mice. Specifically, we found changes in FA and the fractional-order α parameter that were correlated with microstructural changes observed using light and electron microscopy. The paper ends with a discussion of the potential impact of these results on the early diagnosis of axonal pathology in HD, and the conclusion that the anomalous diffusion model should be included in future clinical studies.",

    "Theory (anomalous diffusion)": {
      "text": "The model of anomalous diffusion used in this paper is based on the CTRW extension of Brownian motion 26,27. Mathematically, the model is implemented by generalizing both the space and the time derivatives in Ficks first and second laws of diffusion to non-integer powers using fractional calculus 28. Statistically, this approach considers particle motion characterized by separate inverse power law distributions of jump lengths and waiting times: a non-Gaussian stochastic process that captures the complex microenvironment in brain tissue 29303132. The resulting diffusion propagator, P(x,t), in one dimension is the solution to the following fractional-order partial differential equation version of Ficks second law:\n(1)\nThe operator on the left-hand side of Eq. ( 1) represents the Caputo fractional derivative in time for 0  α  1, and the operator on the right represents the symmetric Riesz fractional derivative in space for 1  β  2, where D α,β (mm β s α ) is the fractional-order diffusion coefficient 33. In the case of α  1 and β  2, Eq. ( 1) reverts to the classical integer order form of Ficks second law of diffusion 15. For a point source at the origin of an unbounded medium, the solution to Eq. ( 1) can be obtained using the Laplace and Fourier transforms 34, which in the Fourier domain of spatial frequencies (k), gives\nIn Eq. ( 2), E α (z)   n  0  z n Γ (αn  1) , is the Mittag-Leffler function and Γ(αn  1) is the Gamma function 18. The Mittag-Leffler function interpolates between the stretched exponential and power law decay over its domain 0,  and converges to the exponential when α  1 and β  2 35. Under the restriction of short diffusion, gradient pulses, p(k,t), can be estimated in a diffusion-weighted MRI experiment 27.",

These animals were used for electron microscopy (Sect. 3.4). Littermates derived from this cross were further crossed with YFP(J16)  mice to produce YFP -(henceforth, YFP) and YFP --R62 mice (henceforth YFP, R62 mice). These animals were used for MRI imaging and histology (Sects. 3.2 and 3.3). At the early symptomatic stage (P60), mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS containing 4 paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were stored in PBS at 4 C until MRI was performed. To evaluate brain morphology using fluorescence microscopy-based methods, we crossed homozygous YFP (J16) male mice (Thy-1, JAX 003709, The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) with R62 females.

Twenty-four hours before imaging, the fixed brains (n  6 per experimental group) were washed in excess PBS and blindly assigned to two different groups. Each group of three brains (four MRI sessions) was stacked in a 20-mm diameter NMR tube using a custom-built 3D printed plastic holder to align three brains. The brains were then immersed in Fluorinert (3M, FC-770) to establish a proton-free magnetic susceptibility matching environment. The NMR tube was tightly fit into a 20 mm diameter birdcage RF coil and inserted into the Micro-2.5 gradient set (1500 mTm) of the spectrometer. The temperature of the samples reflected the cool bore temperature of the polarizing magnet (typically, 18-25 C).\nFor acquiring data for the anomalous diffusion model, a stimulated echo diffusion-weighted pulse sequence was used with TRTE values of 4000 ms28 ms, four averages, and for the 2 cm diameter field of view, an in-plane resolution of 100 μm  100 μm, and a slice thickness of 400 μm. The Stejskal-Tanner diffusion pulse sequence parameters used had a pulsewidth, δ, of 3.5 ms, a pulse separation, Δ, of 15.6 ms, and a gradient strength ranging from 183 to 1300 mTm, corresponding to diffusion weighting b values of 400, 800, 1500, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10,000, 12,000, 15,000, and 20,000 smm 2 . Three orthogonal diffusion gradient directions were acquired to generate a trace image for CTRW analysis. Total scan time was approximately 15 h. DTI was also performed using a stimulated echo diffusion sequence, but with 200 μm isotropic resolution, two averages, and TRTE values of 3000 ms25 ms. For the DTI acquisition, we acquired two b  0 measurements and used a Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence applied in 12 gradient directions with a δ of 3.5 ms, a Δ of 15.6 ms, and a gradient strength of 356 mTm, for a b value of 1500 smm 2 . From these data, we calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the diffusion tensor. Following standard convention, the data are presented as the fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) 15. DTI data were analyzed using MRI Analysis Software (MAS), available from http: marecilab.mbi.ufl.edu. To calculate the CTRW parameters of Eq. ( 2), we wrote a dedicated MATLAB fitting routine that used the normalized trace data to fit α, β, and D α,β by applying a Levenberg Marquadt minimization algorithm on a voxelwise basis. In this fitting, we used Padé approximations to the Mittag-Leffler function that was provided by C. Ingo and described in 18.

The mono-exponential MRI diffusion model (b values of 0 and 1500 smm 2 ) was used to fit the DTI data acquired from the brains of R62 mice. We calculated the AD, MD, RD, and FA for four consecutive coronal slices (stereotaxic coordinates from Praxinos, Bregma 1.32 mm) using matched regions of interest (ROI) selected within the CC of WT and R62 symptomatic animals (Fig. 1a).

      "text": "The goal of this work is to study the association of changes in WM integrity captured by DTI and CTRW parameters from a high field MRI (17.6 T) with cellular changes visualized by fluorescence and electron microscopy applied a well-established mouse model of HD (R62 mice). The CTRW model is intermediate between a tissue compartmental analysis and a heuristic fit to the data. CTRW is a stochastic model, like kurtosis, which interpolates between the classical Gaussian description of diffusion and non-Gaussian propagator models used in characterizing anomalous diffusion 43. The new idea in the CTRW model is to account for particle trapping, not by building models of the tissue microstructure, but by introducing a waiting time into each step of the underlying Brownian motion, and to account for particle displacement by introducing a jump increment after each rest 33. Hence, the Brownian path trajectory is a balance of competing factors, one which describes sub-diffusion, compared with Gaussian motion, and the other, which describes superdiffusion 34. Formally, the tendencies are introduced as separate inverse power laws for the waiting times and jump displacements, respectively 30. Mathematically, the underlying statistical assumptions of the CTRW model generalize the order of the governing time and space derivatives into α and β, so that sharp fall offs in the likelihood of a long waiting time or a large particle displacement only occur when α and β are near the integer Gaussian case of α  1 and β  2 (where the respective probabilities are Dirac delta functions) 32. Physically, when α  1 and β  2, the diffusion process can be viewed as a distribution of sub-compartments, each representing a fraction of particles that-compared with the case of Gaussian Brownian motion-are trapped or transiently tugged into a fast flowing eddy. For example, CTRW models are used in the earth sciences 44 to describe surface erosion due to wind and rain of a gully or canyon, with small grains of sand moving slowly down the slope via hindered and restricted diffusion, and small rocks not moving as all, until all of a sudden the nearby support wears away, and the stone rolls 44. When applied to brain tissue, the CTRW is used to capture aspects of the tissues structural complexity, indirectly via the association of D α,β with hindered diffusion, α with trapped water (restricted diffusion), and β with perfusion and membrane permeability 18,27.\nMRI has proved to be a useful method for monitoring HD progression by measuring volume loss within the striatum 45. As axonal pathology became increasingly recognized as an early and critical pathogenic event in HD 46, methods that probe sub-voxel structure have been pursued. For example, changes in diffusion parameters such as the fractional anisotropy and the mean diffusivity have been reported in HD patients long before loss of cerebral mass occurs 47,48. The parallel organization of axons within the CC makes this major white matter brain structure particularly suitable as a site to detect axonal changes at presymptomatic disease stages 49. DTI provides sub-voxel information from which one can map the fiber pathways, and fiber density and fiber track maps are used to distinguish changes in brain connectivity, as fibers are lost, rearranged, or rerouted 50,52.\nCurrent DTI models use the Gaussian, mono-exponential model for diffusion-weighed signal decay to express degeneration in WM microstructure in terms of changes in the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy 52. In this study, we also fit the data-at high b values -to a CTRW model that has been shown to capture brain tissue complexity 18. We also used fluorescence microscopy and IHC techniques, to confirm the microstructural imaging biomarkers suggested by the DTI and CTRW models. The application of these optical methods using a mouse model featuring mosaic YFP expression 53 confirmed a marked disorganization and partial loss of callosal axons, as well as astrogliosis and myelin deficits 545556. Extending these findings, TEM revealed increased geometrical complexity across degenerating axons in the R62 mice, a finding consistent with observations of CC degeneration in HD patients 58,59.\nOur results indicate that both the DTI and CTRW diffusion models provide evidence of microstructural alterations in the corpus callosum of the R62 mice (Figs. 1 and2). Decreasing FA is correlated not only with increased clinical severity in HD 59, but also with alterations in WM brain microstructure 12 and demyelination 60. In particular, the FA is able to distinguish cuprizone-induced demyelination from remyelination 61, while MD is sensitive to gliosis and relative density or packing of axonal bundles 35. In this study, the DTI and CTRW analyses were confirmed by histochemical and ultrastructural data (Figs. 3 and4). From the histological data (Fig. 3), astrocytes are significantly increased in the brain regions studied, which could increase cellularity, which in tumors is associated with an increase in the diffusion coefficient 202122 and a decrease in the α value of the stretched exponential and the Mittag-Leffler function. Hence, it is not surprising that we observed similar changes in the MD and α in the afflicted animals. The CTRW parameters (particularly α) appear to correlate with changes in the TEM images (Fig. 4) that show a closer packing of axons and greater extracellular tortuosity in Huntingtons diseaseconsistent with the published literature 21,63-and with the idea that waiting times increase (diffusion particle trapping) in step with greater tissue heterogeneity, as described in our previous studies 63.\nThus, the CTRW parameters provide information on the tortuosity of the tissue microenvironment 63,64. This result is similar to decreases in α found by others to be associated with increased tissue heterogeneity 64 and complexity 65. However, the utility of the fractional β parameter as a biomarker of HD in our current experiments remains unclear, as changes in this parameter were not significant in this particular animal model or disease stage; a finding that will be pursued in the future in vivo experiments.",

      "text": "In this study, we present a histologically verified comparison of diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI) with the continuous time random walk (CTRW) model of anomalous diffusion in the case of developing pathology in the R62 mouse model of Huntingtons disease. Changes in organization were detected in WM tracts using both DTI and the CTRW models, changes that histology showed correspond with axonal reorganization, myelin content reduction, and glial cell redistribution. The complex cellular changes in the WM during the development of HD were not completely described by the DTI model, and supplemental information was provided by the CTRW parameters. Specifically, the α parameter reduction appears to reflect the increased axonal density and tortuosity, while demyelination in the corpus callosum is in agreement with an increase in radial diffusivity and the observed decrease in the fractional anisotropy. The future directions for this work will focus on confirming the connection between the early stages of HD pathology and the observed changes in the CTRW parameters and on improving the sensitivity of the high b value diffusion-weighted MRI, so that in vivo studies of HD in animal models and clinical MRI scanners can be performed.

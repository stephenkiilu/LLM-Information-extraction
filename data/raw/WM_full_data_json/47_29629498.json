    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the pattern of white matter (WM) changes associated with Parkinsons disease (PD)-related cognitive impairment by using fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) measures. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was performed in 21 PD-patients with dementia (PDD) and in an agematched control group including 40 PD-patients without dementia (PD-CTRL). The Parkinsons disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) was used for patients neuropsychological assessment. Local microstructural WM differences associated with the presence of cognitive impairment were tested using tract-based spatial statistics analysis. Multiple regression models investigated the association of DTI indices with total PD-CRS score, PD-CRS raw items and other clinical measures across the whole study sample. Significant FA decreases were found in PDD compared to PD-CTRL patients mainly in the body of corpus callosum, corona radiata and cingulum. Lower PD-CRS score was significantly associated with decreased FA, MD and AD values in multiple WM tracts primarily located in prefrontal and limbic areas as well as across the corpus callosum. Lower performance in specific PD-CRS raw items was also associated with FA decreases in major WM tracts. The results suggest that multifocal microstructural changes of WM accompany the transition from normal to demented cognitive state in PD-patients. The corpus callosum, the corona radiata and the cingulum are among the regions mostly affected during this course. A progressive axonal degeneration is proposed as a key underlying mechanism.",

      "text": "Among the multiple non-motor symptoms emerging during the course of Parkinsons disease (PD), dementia constitutes a milestone in the progression of patients disability. Attention, constructional and executive functions are considered as the cognitive domains first and foremost impaired in PD patients, leading to a predominantly Bsubcorticalor Bdysexecutivetype of dementia (Emre et al. 2007). Brain imaging studies hold great promise in detecting changes that can be used as biomarkers for timely assessment of cognitive deterioration and therapeutic intervention.\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a cutting edge technique for the in vivo evaluation of white mater (WM) microstructure. Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is the widest used DTI index measuring the anisotropy of water diffusion. Even though FA is highly sensitive to microstructural alterations, its specificity is limited. The specificity of FA can be enhanced by the use of mean diffusivity (MD), which assesses the magnitude of diffusion. Complementarily, the measurement of axial diffusivity (AD) that describes the principal eigenvector (λ 1 ) of the diffusion tensor, and radial diffusivity (RD) that describes the diffusion orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of WM fibers (λ 2  λ 3 2) can provide useful information on the directionality of diffusion and consequently on the neuropathological Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https:doi.org10.1007s11682-018-9863-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. foundation of WM changes. AD changes have been associated to alterations in the axonal diameters or density, while RD changes have been observed in presence of de-or dysmyelination (Wozniak and Lim 2006).\nImpairments in many major tracts have been reported in the relatively low number of currently available DTI studies in PD-patients with various degrees of cognitive decline (Matsui et al. 2007;Lee et al. 2010;Hattori et al. 2012;Kamagata et al. 2012;Kamagata et al. 2013;Deng et al. 2013;Perea et al. 2013;Melzer et al. 2013;Agosta et al. 2014;Chen et al. 2015). Prefrontal WM was the region most consistently affected in the above studies. FA andor MD correlations with deficits in executive functions and to a lesser extend in other cognitive domains have been also described in patients without evident dementia (Rae et al. 2012;Koshimori et al. 2015;Zheng et al. 2014;Carlesimo et al. 2012;Theilmann et al. 2013). Changes in directional diffusivities have been only recently reported in a longitudinal study which compared microstructural WM changes in de-novo, nondemented PD patients to normal aging (Zhang et al. 2016). In that study, increased AD and RD values were strongly correlated with progressive cognitive decline as assessed with MoCA test in PD-patients.\nDiverse image-analysis protocols were used in the abovementioned studies.\nSome studies adopted a region of interest (ROI) approach (Deng et al. 2013;Matsui et al. 2007;Zhang et al. 2016). ROI-based analysis is time-consuming, subjective, limited (rest of brain unchecked) and mismatched (Astrakas and Argyropoulou 2010). On the other hand, voxel-wise analysis assesses the whole brain and provides statistical inferences at voxel level with good control of statistical error (Astrakas and Argyropoulou 2010). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is a particular voxel-wise method of statistical analysis of DTI derived data. This method has been widely used because of its robust non-parametric assessment of local differences in WM integrity between groups (Smith et al. 2006).\nTo our knowledge no previous study has explored alterations in DTI indices according to patients performance in a scale specifically designed for PD. Commonly used cognitive scales have shown low sensitivity in the diagnosis of PD dementia due to its distinct pattern (Kulisevsky and Pagonabarraga 2009). Parkinsons Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) is targeted to cover the full spectrum of cognitive defects associated with PD, including items sensitive to both fronto-subcortical and posterior cortical dysfunction (Pagonabarraga et al. 2008). Additionaly, changes in directional diffusivities have never been examined in PD-patients with dementia. The present study aimed to use TBSS to compare differences in FA, MD, AD and RD between demented and non-demented PD-patients examined with PD-CRS. Progressive changes in WM architecture were investigated through multiple regression analyses of DTI indices with PD-CRS total score and sub-scores.",

      "text": "Two age-matched groups consisted of 21 PD-patients with dementia (PDD) and 40 non-demented PD-patients (PD-CTRL) were examined. The neuropsychological and MRI testing were performed within 3 months between each other. Patients were recruited from the movement disorder outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Ioannina and were diagnosed by a movement disorders neurologist according to UK Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD (Hughes et al. 1992). Each patient was interviewed regarding educational level, date of disease onset, duration of treatment with levodopa and current medication. Daily dose of dopaminergic drugs was converted to Levodopa Equivalent Dose (LED) (Tomlinson et al. 2010). The severity of disease was assessed with the modified HoehnYahr (HY) scale and the motor subtype (postural instability and gait difficulty-predominant disease (PIGD) tremor-dominant indeterminate) according to the method suggested by Jankovic et al. (Jankovic et al. 1990). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). No participant included in the study had a HAM-D score over 18 indicating severe depression. Individuals with clinical signs of atypical parkinsonism or Lewy body dementia, noncompensated systematic diseases, serious psychiatric conditions, laboratory abnormalities that could account for dementia and those with limited ability to complete the neuropsychological or MRI evaluation were excluded. Before inclusion in the analysis patients MRI data were reviewed in order to further exclude cases presenting focal brain lesions, diffuse white matter hyperintensities observed in T2-weighted MRI or T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) or motion artefacts.",

Prior to application PD-CRS was adapted in the Greek language (Chondrogiorgi et al. 2015).\nThe neuropsychological assessment took place in a quiet room. All patients were examined during the Bon medicationŝ tate. The previously recommended cut-off score of 64 points in PD-CRS (Pagonabarraga et al. 2008) was used to separate PDD from non-demented patients. Additionally, for descriptive reasons, all participants underwent examination with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive decline in PDD patients should have a considerable effect on day-to-day functioning as assessed with caregiver interview and the Pill questionnaire (Dubois et al. 2007).",

      "text": "DTI analysis was performed with the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Smith et al. 2004). The preprocessing steps involved motion and eddy current correction and brain extraction. Then FA, MD, AD and RD maps were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data and aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT to the FSLs MNI FMRIB58FA template. After creating the mean sample template and applying a pre-statistical threshold of 0.2, a voxel-wise statistical analysis of the FA, MD, AD and RD data was carried out using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al. 2006), part of FSL. TBSS projects all subjects FA normalized data onto a mean FA tract skeleton, including only regions with maximum FA intensity along the perpendicular direction (breadth) of a white matter tract before applying voxelwise cross-subject statistics, in order to consider for analysis only WM structures that are almost conserved across population. WM group differences were assessed with a GLM analysis including educational level as covariate. Multiple regression models investigated the association between FAMDADRD and total PD-CRS score across all participants, including age and educational level as covariates. Further regression analyses were performed examining the relationship between FA and the scores of the nine PD-CRS raw items including the same covariates. Since previous studies have shown differences in neuronal integrity according to motor phenotype in PD-patients (Nagae et al. 2016;Lenfeldt et al. 2016), all analyses except for those concerning PD-CRS raw items were rerun with the inclusion of motor subtype (PIGD tremordominant indeterminate) as an additional covariate. Regression analyses assessing the relationship of FA and MD with the duration and the stage of the disease and the total LED were also conducted. Results were thresholded at p  0.05 with correction for multiple comparisons (familywise error) adopting the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) randomize (5000 permutation) method (Smith et al. 2006) included in FSL.\nTracts were localized according to the BJohn Hopkins University ICBM-DTI-81 White Matter Labelsand BJohn Hopkins University White Matter Tractographyatlases provided in FSL.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study investigated WM abnormalities through the use multiple diffusion indices in PD-patients with cognitive impairment. latter was assessed with a scale explicitly designed to detect cognitive deficits related to PD. A significant pattern of subcortical WM alteration in areas including corpus callosum, the corona radiata, and the cingulum was found to be associated with cognitive impairment as assessed with PD-CRS. In addition, lower performance on particular tasks assessing specific cortical and subcortical functions was associated with FA decreases in major WM tracts. The total PD-CRS score associated positively with FA in WM tracts primarily located in prefrontal and limbic areas as well as across the corpus callosum. Previous studies using the same image analysis protocol (TBSS) have reported significant correlations between FA values and MMSE score in corpus callosum, IFF, SLF, ILF, uncinate fasciculus and cingulum (Hattori et al. 2012;Kamagata et al. 2013). A novel finding of the present study is a linear association of AD with the PD-CRS score, involving most of the major WM tracts, without concurrent RD alterations. This finding might suggest that an extensive and progressive axonal degeneration, without evident demyelination (Song et al. 2003;Sun et al. 2005), underlies cognitive impairment in PD-patients. A decrease of MD implying the presence of restricted diffusion was also observed in patients with poorer cognitive performance. Although rather unexpected for neurodegenerative processes, decreases in MD, either with or without concomitant AD fall, have been previously demonstrated in presymptomatic cases of familial Alzheimers disease (Ryan et al. 2013;Fortea et al. 2010) with greater MD decreases being associated with higher amyloid burden (Racine et al. 2014). Axonal beading and fragmentation, along with amyloid depositions and compensatory cellular swelling and glial activation, have been all proposed as possible mechanisms introducing barriers that can restrict diffusion in both the intracellular and extracellular space (Ryan et al. 2013;Racine et al. 2014;Budde and Frank 2010). Similar mechanisms could also explain our findings since the presence of Alzheimers disease-related protein aggregates is also well recognized in PDD (Braak et al. 2005). Moreover, considering previous evidence that supports a parallel progression of neuropathological PD stage with cognitive decline (Braak et al. 2006), we could hypothesize that an increased accumulation of axonal α-synouclein inclusions, mainly in the form of Lewy neurites, could further impede free water molecular motion in certain WM regions of demented individuals. In terms of localization, MD changes highly mirrored those of AD but with a relative sparing of frontal regions, a finding potentially and partially explained by the caudo-rostral spreading of Lewy pathology as proposed by Braak (Braak et al. 2003).\nAmong the nine raw items of PD-CRS, performance in one Bcortical-type(confrontation naming) and two Bsubcortical-type(immediate verbal memory and working memory) items demonstrated a positive association with FA. All associations were of high statistical significance and involved multiple tracts. The Bdual-syndrome hypothesissuggests that executive impairment, mediated from fronto-striatal dopaminergic dysfunction, appears in PD and is later superimposed by additional deficits with a strong cholinergic basis, that define the onset of PDD (Kehagia et al. 2013). Without contradicting the above theory, our findings indicate that decline in certain, presumably dopamine-independent cognitive domains, such as visual recognition and recall, may be also associated with considerable WM microstructural disorganization even in PD-patients with relatively preserved general cognitive status.\nRegarding the two-group analysis, in line with our findings, previous studies have also provided evidence for FA decreases in corpus callosum (Deng et al. 2013;Hattori et al. 2012;Kamagata et al. 2013), superior corona radiata (Melzer et al. 2013), cingulum (Hughes et al. 1992;Perea et al. 2013), IFF (Kamagata et al. 2013;Perea et al. 2013), ATR (Perea et al. 2013), uncinate fasciculus (Hattori et al. 2012;Perea et al. 2013) and forceps minor (Perea et al. 2013) in demented versus nondemented PD-patients. Changes in SLF (Hattori et al. 2012;Perea et al. 2013), ILF (Hattori et al. 2012;Perea et al. 2013) and CST (Melzer et al. 2013) have been also reported, while our study is the first to show low FA values also in the anterior corona radiata.\nThe most consistent finding across our analyses was the decrease of FA in the corpus callosum, corona radiata and cingulum in patients with major cognitive involvement. The absence of overt callosal atrophy in PD-patients irrespectively of their cognitive condition has been proposed as an aspect differentiating PD from other neurodegenerative diseases (Wiltshire et al. 2005). However, FA decreases in various parts of corpus callosum, has been repeatedly shown in studies comparing PDD to non-demented PD-patients (Deng et al. 2013;Hattori et al. 2012;Kamagata et al. 2013). The observed fiber damage could either reflect or induce a topographically associated cortical pathology. On the other hand, corona radiata is a dense WM arc carrying almost all of the neural connections from and to the cerebral cortex. Although its involvement in PDD has received relatively little attention, diffusion abnormalities in the anterior, the superior or the posterior corona radiata have been previously correlated with attentional, executive and visuospatial skills (Zheng et al. 2014;Theilmann et al. 2013). Microstructural changes in this region, along with similar changes in other projection fibers as found in this study, probably underlie a disconnection syndrome in subcortical thalamic-basal-prefrontal circuits. To end with, the present study confirms and extends previous knowledge of the significant role of cingulum in cognition, also in PD (Deng et al. 2013;Perea et al. 2013;Kamagata et 2012). The cingulum connects the hippocampus the posterior cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex changes across its course have been mostly associated with deficits in episodic memory and visuospatial processing (Kamagata et al. 2012;Wu et al. 2010).\nSome limitations of the present study need to be addressed. First of all, the purely cross-sectional design of the study does not allow firm conclusions on the progressive nature of changes to be drawn. Secondly, comparison of results with that of previous studies should be made in the light of limitations arising from different cognitive scales and imaging protocols used. Additional study limitations include the absence of control group consisted of healthy participants and the use of 1.5 T MRI scanner with 8-channel RF head coil and only 16 diffusion directions. Furthermore, despite the validity of PD-CRS in the discrimination of cognitive categories has been previously proved (Pagonabarraga et al. 2008), potential cases of misclassification cannot be excluded. The stage and duration of the disease, as well as the total LED, differed insignificantly across the groups and did not correlate significantly with FA in any WM region, and therefore the risk of these parameters to substantially interfere with our results is small. Conclusion: A widespread network of WM diffusion abnormalities is associated with the degree of PD-related cognitive impairment. The corpus callosum, the corona radiata and the cingulum are among the regions mostly affected during this course. DTI indices provide valuable information in the comprehension and extent of the underlying pathology. Longitudinal research is warranted to elucidate the chronological sequence of changes and confirm the presence of cognitive and imaging patterns predicting progression to dementia.",

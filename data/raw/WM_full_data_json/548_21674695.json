    "abstract": "Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affect the limbic system, causing medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) hypometabolism. Additionally, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have demonstrated that MCI and AD involve alterations in cerebral white matter (WM) integrity. Objectives: To test if (1) patients with MCI and AD exhibit decreases in the integrity of limbic WM pathways; (2) disconnection between PCC and MTL, manifested as disruption of the cingulum bundle, contributes to PCC hypometabolism during incipient AD. Methods: We measured fractional anisotropy (FA) and volume of the fornix and cingulum using DTI in 23 individuals with MCI, 21 with mild-to-moderate AD, and 16 normal control (NC) subjects. We also measured PCC metabolism using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in AD and MCI patients. Results: Fornix FA and volume were reduced in MCI and AD to a similar extent. Descending cingulum FA was reduced in AD while volume was reduced in MCI and even more so in AD. Both FA and volume of the fornix and descending cingulum reliably discriminated between NC and AD. Fornix FA and descending cingulum volume also reliably discriminated between NC and MCI. Only descending cingulum volume reliably discriminated between MCI and AD. In the combined MCI-AD cohort, PCC metabolism directly correlated with both FA and volume of the descending cingulum. Conclusions: Disruption of limbic WM pathways is evident during both MCI and AD. Disconnection of the PCC from MTL at the cingulum bundle contributes to PCC hypometabolism during incipient AD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among older adults and traditionally conceptualized as a disease of brain gray matter, with particular involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), temporoparietal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). However, studies with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MRI technique that assesses microstructural organization of white matter (WM) based on measurements of water diffusion, have demonstrated that AD also involves alterations in WM integrity. Patients with probable AD have a reduction in the integrity of WM tracts connecting regions of association cortex, such as the splenium of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum bundle, while integrity of the pyramidal tracts (e.g., posterior limb of the internal capsule) is generally preserved Bozzali et al., 2002;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Rose et al., 2000. The likely pathogenic mechanism of these WM changes in AD is Wallerian degeneration of fiber tracts due to neuronal loss in cortical associative areas affected by AD pathology Bozzali et al., 2002;Braak and Braak, 1996.\nDTI has also been extended to study older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who have an increased risk of developing dementia relative to their healthy counterparts. Fellgiebel et al. 2005 showed that fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of WM integrity, differed significantly between controls and both MCI and AD patients in regions affected by AD neurodegeneration. They also showed that performance of the MCI-AD group on the delayed verbal recall test was correlated with posterior cingulum bundle FA. Other studies have shown that FA of cingulum fibers are significantly reduced in MCI, and even more so in AD Choo et al., 2008;Liu et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2007. DTI studies of limbic WM in MCI and AD show some discrepancy, however. Kiuchi et al. 2009, using DTI tractography, found decreased FA in the posterior cingulate fasciculus of MCI patients (relative to normal controls) but no difference between MCI and AD groups. In contrast, Mielke et al. 2009, utilizing a region-of-interest (ROI) technique, found FA differences between MCI and AD subjects in a different region of the cingulum and the fornix but no differences between NC and MCI groups in these areas. In general, studies examining limbic FA in the three subject groups (normal controls, MCI and AD) have not been able to demonstrate a three-way distinction; either the normal or MCI groups differed from ADs, but not from each other, or MCI and AD reveal similar changes in FA, different from the controls.\nIn addition to FA alone, some recent studies have employed multimodal MRI to obtain simultaneous measures of FA and volume. The most common way to do this has been with an ROI-based assessment of FA combined with voxel-based morphometry, as was employed by Walhovd et al. 2009. This study showed that higher diagnostic accuracy was achieved when multiple methods and ROIs were combined, though morphometry showed the best diagnostic (predictive) sensitivity. In our study, as in some others Mielke et al., 2009;Thomas et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2007, a tract-based approach is used to obtain the volumetric information as well as the mean FA of that volume.\nWM degeneration has been proposed as a mechanism for the well-documented functional deficit of the PCC observed on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans, a finding often present during early stages of AD in parallel with MTL atrophy Minoshima et al., 1997. This hippocampal-neocortical disconnection hypothesis posits that PCC hypometabolism occurring during incipient AD may be due to a distant effect of neuronal dysfunction in the MTL via disconnection at the cingulum bundle, an idea first put forth in the early 1990s Jobst et al., 1992 with more recent imaging support from FDG-PET Nestor et al., 2003 and combined FDG-PETMRI studies  Che telat et al., 2008;Meguro et al., 2001;Villain et al., 2008. Consistent with this hypothesis, Zhou et al. 2008 used DTI and fMRI to show that there is decreased structural connectivity from both the PCC and hippocampus to the whole brain as well as a reduction in functional connectivity between these two regions in MCI and AD. Few studies, however, have tested the disconnection hypothesis directly.\nThe present study was designed to (1) address the discrepancies from prior DTI studies of limbic WM in MCI and AD; and (2) directly test the disconnection hypothesis of PCC hypometabolism via a combined structuralfunctional approach. Specifically, we hypothesized that patients with both MCI and AD should exhibit decreases in the integrity of limbic WM pathways, reflective of the neuronal dysfunction and atrophy in the MTL. We used DTI to investigate changes in FA and volume of the fornix and cingulum on a continuum from normal aging to MCI to AD. We also investigated the relationship between integrity of the cingulum bundle and PCC hypometabolism with combined DTI and FDG-PET. Folstein et al., 1975 for the three subject groups.",

      "text": "After transferring raw DTI data to a separate computer workstation, they were interpolated to an isotropic voxel size of 1.5 mm 3 using tools from the FMRIB Software Library Smith et al., 2004; during this step, DTI data were also converted from the native DICOM format to ANA-LYZE format. Data were further processed using MRI Studio (www.mristudio.org) Jiang et al., 2006 to calculate whole-brain diffusion tensor and FA maps for subsequent fiber tracking. The 3D reconstructions of the fornix, cingulum bundle, its associated parietal projection fibers, and posterior limb of the internal capsule (a control region) were accomplished by using computational tractography algorithms implemented in MRI Studio. For each tract, multiple 2D region of interest (ROI) seeds, selected based on a priori knowledge of tract anatomy, were placed on DTI maps created within MRI Studio (Fig. 1a-c); an FA colormap, indicating fiber orientation, aided in the placement of ROI seeds. Fibers were then tracked voxel-by-voxel along the primary eigenvector (i.e., vector of the largest eigenvalue), constrained by the ROI seeds. An FA threshold of !0.2 and curvature threshold of !60 were used to further constrain the course of fiber tracts in the brain. Some post-hoc pruning of tracts was necessary in order to remove extraneous fibers if they were determined to be inconsistent with known tract anatomy. Figure 1d shows 3D reconstructions of the fornix, cingulum, and internal capsule from a representative subject. A neurologist checked the tractography results for each subject. Fiber tracts and FA maps were subsequently re-oriented into standard orientation relative to the AC-PC and horizontal transverse axes of an anatomical template via affine transformation. These re-oriented fiber tracts and FA maps were then exported in a binary format for further analysis in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA), which was used to crop specific tract ROIs based on a standardized set of anatomical landmarks (Fig. 1d).\nThe landmark boundaries for each ROI, identified on the non-diffusion weighted DTI image for each subject, were as follows: The fornix body was defined as that portion of the tract posterior to the fornix columns and anterior to the crura. The cingulum bundle was divided into three portions: superior cingulum was defined as that portion of the tract posterior to the genu and anterior to the splenium of corpus callosum; descending cingulum was defined as that portion of the tract below superior aspect of the fornix body and above inferior aspect of the temporal horn; parietal projection fibers were defined as that portion of the tract above superior aspect of the fornix body and posterior to the descending cingulum. Posterior limb of the internal capsule was defined as that portion of the tract below superior aspect of the fornix body and above superior aspect of the midbrain as well as posterior to the genu and anterior to the splenium of corpus callosum. Then, average FA and volume were computed for each ROI, as measures of tract integrity, for subsequent statistical analysis. Certain steps of the processing stream were performed manually (seed placement, post-hoc pruning of fibers, and definition of ROI boundaries) by an operator, who was blinded to subjects diagnostic group.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The results of this study suggest that fornix integrity declines during the transition from normal aging to MCI. In contrast, descending cingulum integrity declines during both the transition from normal aging to MCI and the transition from MCI to AD. The posterior limb of the internal capsule, which is part of the motor system, did not show significant changes in its integrity across the normalto-AD continuum. Similarly, the superior cingulum, which is also part of the limbic system but less intimately associated with the MTL memory system, was also unaffected. Thus, our results indicate that white matter degeneration shows selectivity during early-to-moderate stages of AD, affecting pathways which mediate memory function (i.e., fornix and descending cingulum) more prominently than pathways related to non-memory function (e.g., superior cingulum and internal capsule). This is consistent with previous findings that intracortical (e.g., limbic) projecting fibers are affected preferentially early in the course of AD, at a point in time when extracortical fiber tracts are still relatively preserved Braak and Braak, 1996;Teipel et al., 2007. Furthermore, our ROC analysis indicates that the integrity of fornix and descending cingulum (measured as FA andor volume) can reliably distinguish among NC, MCI, and AD groups. Our findings are consistent with other recent DTI studies that have reported declines in fornix and cingulum FA in both MCI and AD patients Kiuchi et al., 2009;Liu et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2009;Teipel et al., 2007;Xie et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2007.\nOur DTI findings are consistent with the idea that degeneration of the fornix and cingulum bundle, which serve as major input and output pathways of the hippocampal formation Duvernoy, 1998, likely occurs secondary to progressive hippocampal damage in MCI and AD. Furthermore, the observed decline in fornix and cingulum integrity on a continuum from normal-to-MCI-to-AD was further corroborated by significant positive relationships between fornixcingulum integrity and MMSE scores, as a surrogate of disease severity.\nAlthough we found differences in PET metabolism between the combined MCIAD cohort and the normal subject database, we did not see robust differences between individual patient groups. We believe that this is related to the heterogeneity of our MCI sample, which included amnestic and nonamnestic MCI individuals, as well as those with multi-domain deficits. We deliberately sought to include all MCI subtypes both because it better reflects the actual patient population with this condition, and because it is far from clear in the existing literature whether these subtypes represent different underlying etiologies. Results from the DTI-PET correlation analysis indicate that PCC hypometabolism is, at least in part, related to descending cingulum integrity in the combined MCIAD cohort (see Fig. 4). In our study, this structure-function relationship exhibited anatomical specificity (as opposed to being a global effect) given that such a relationship was absent for the superior cingulum and parietotemporal regions (Table V). This finding lends support to the hippocampal-neocortical disconnection hypothesis of PCC hypometabolism in early AD, which posits that PCC hypometabolism may be due to a distant effect of neuronal dysfunction in the MTL via disconnection at the cingulum bundle Che telat et al., 2008;Jobst et al., 1992;Meguro et al., 2001;Nestor et al., 2003.\nNevertheless, the structure-function relationship between descending cingulum and PCC was modest in the present study, accounting for 12 of the variance (r ¼ 0.35). This implies that there may be other concurrent mechanisms contributing to PCC hypometabolism, independent of its connection to the MTL via the cingulum bundle. Local damage (i.e., neuronal dysfunction andor atrophy) in the PCC serves as one such alternate mechanism for causing PCC hypometabolism Baron et al., 2001;Che telat et al., 2002Che telat et al., , 2009. Damage in the PCC may result, for instance, from local b-amyloid accumulation that reaches critical levels during early stages of AD, as measured by PET imaging Buckner et al., 2005;Sperling et al., 2009. Interestingly, we found that descending cingulum integrity predicted MMSE performance independently of PCC metabolism but not vice-versa. This suggests that the association between cognitive decline (as measured by MMSE performance) and PCC dysfunction in our study was secondary to disruption of the descending cingulum, consistent with the disconnection hypothesis.\nTo our knowledge, few studies have tested the disconnection hypothesis directly by correlating measurements of the cingulum bundle with either structural or functional properties of the PCC. Villain et al. 2008Villain et al.  , 2010  used voxel-based morphometric analysis of volumetric MRI data and FDG-PET to show that hippocampal atrophy was related to cingulum bundle atrophy, which itself was associated with PCC hypometabolism in MCI and early AD patients. Our findings complement those of Villain et al. by providing DTI-based evidence for the disconnection hypothesis. Similar to our study, Choo et al. 2008 also investigated the disconnection hypothesis using DTI in MCI and AD patients, but they used volumetric MRI to assess structural damage in the PCC. They found associations among atrophy of MTL structures, cingulum FA, and PCC atrophy. In contrast to the purely structural imaging approach used by Choo et al., we provide evidence for the disconnection hypothesis using a structural-functional approach correlating DTI with FDG-PET, which is widely used in the clinical setting for differential diagnosis of AD.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "DTI data were acquired without suppression of the CSF signal, which can contribute to partial volume effects, particularly in WM adjacent to ventricular spaces Concha et al., 2005. This limitation, coupled with a relatively limited six gradient direction and 3 mm 2 in-plane resolution acquisitions likely contributed to our inability to map the crura of the fornix, thereby restricting our analysis of the fornix to the fornix body. Future studies will proceed with improved technical acquisition parameters as well as CSF signal suppression in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of limbic DTI data. Another limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional, case-control design, which limits the generalizability of findings and interpretation regarding causal mechanisms. Follow-up longitudinal studies can help confirm our findings. Finally, we chose to limit this analysis to limbic tracts that are directly related to the hippocampal formation and posterior cingulate gyrus, but an analysis that included a more extensive array of structures from the Papez circuit might have yielded additional results. Although the lack of PET data in normal control subjects could be viewed as a potential limitation, the Cortex ID program uses an age-matched (in 5 year increments) normal subject database to generate Zscores, and thereby builds in a control population, albeit not one with local population demographics.",

      "text": "In conclusion, our results indicate that disruption of limbic white matter pathways occurs during MCI as well as in early-to-moderate AD in a selective manner. This disruption occurs in a graded manner, with more severely affected individuals having a greater degree of fornix and descending cingulum damage. In addition, our results provide support for the disconnection hypothesis as a mechanism contributing to PCC hypometabolism during incipient AD; this is evidenced by an anatomically specific structural-functional relationship between PCC and descending cingulum.",

In this study, we examined WM changes in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at greater risk for developing AD. A DTI index of WM integrity, fractional anisotropy (FA), was calculated in 14 patients with probable mild AD, 14 participants with MCI and 21 elderly healthy controls (NC). Voxel-by-voxel comparisons showed significant regional reductions of FA in participants with MCI and AD compared to controls in multiple posterior white matter regions. Moreover, there was substantial overlap of locations of regional decrease in FA in the MCI and AD groups. These data demonstrate that white matter changes occur in MCI, prior to the development of dementia.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimers disease (AD). Individuals with amnestic MCI differ from healthy elderly in their level of cognitive function, performing more poorly than controls on measures of memory. Despite impaired memory performance, individuals with MCI do not meet diagnostic criteria for dementia 10,43,596061. MCI is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing AD compared to the elderly population without cognitive impairment 14,23,596061. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies report no significant difference in entorhinal volume 26,29 or the extent of cell loss in layer II of the entorhinal cortex 49 in individuals with cognitive complaints and in patients with MCI compared to those with a diagnosis of AD. Since the entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest sites of pathology in AD, these results indicate that patients with MCI may be in the incipient phase of the disease process. Thus, studies of individuals with MCI provide a unique opportunity to investigate prodromal AD.\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been extensively used to investigate the pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease (AD) in vivo. Additionally, individuals with MCI are now being studied in order to identify anatomical changes that precede a clinical diagnosis and to develop sensitive in vivo markers that may be predictive of conversion to AD. The major emphasis of these studies has been on the detection of atrophy in regions of interest known to be pathologically involved in the disease process. Mesial temporal lobe structures critically important for memory function, such as the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex, have received special attention in these investigations 13,21,22,262728293041,42,47,48,73 because a disturbance in the acquisition of new information is a hallmark of MCI and AD 26,27,29,47,48.\nAlthough most imaging studies of MCI and mild AD have focused on gray matter alterations, a number of post-mortem investigations have documented white matter pathology associated with AD 18,19,31,44,45. White matter changes associated with AD may reflect different underlying causes or mechanisms. First, white matter changes in AD may be indicative of anterograde Wallerian degeneration, especially in regions close to cortical areas with the greatest pathological burden. Secondly, there may be white matter rarefaction 31 with axonal damage and gliosis. This type of change is diffuse, does not follow the regional extension of pathologically involved gray matter, and may be vascular or ischemic in origin. Third, it has recently been suggested that myelin breakdown is an important component of the disease process in AD 456. According to this hypothesis, damage to oligodendrocytes may be a critical initiating step in the disease. Furthermore, since late developing oligodendrocytes may be more vulnerable, late-mylenating association areas are predicted to be more susceptible to myelin breakdown.\nThe results of imaging studies tend to support post-mortem findings of white matter abnormalities in MCI and AD. Increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) have been found in both MCI and AD using either semi-quantitative radiologic ratings scales 2,51 or quantitative measurements 5,12,24,32. The role of WMH in the pathology or disease severity of MCI or AD is not established, however. Independence between WMH and diagnosis or cognitive impairment has been reported by some authors 12,40,51, while others report significant correlations between WMH and diagnosis or cognitive impairment 2,24,32. These discrepancies may be due to differences in the sample studied, analytic methods, or sensitivity of the MRI methodology.\nA recently developed structural MRI technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), provides increased sensitivity to alterations in the microstructure of white matter in vivo and is especially indicative for diseases causing axonal damage and demyelination 78952,70. DTI detects microstructural alterations in white matter by measuring the directionality of molecular diffusion (fractional anisotropy: FA). Highly organized white matter tracts have high FA because diffusion is highly constrained by the tracts cellular organization. As white matter is damaged, FA decreases due to decreased anisotropic diffusion.\nPrevious investigations of white matter changes in AD or MCI using diffusion weighted MRI have reported changes in mean diffusivity and anisotropic diffusion 15,16,33,36,37,39,46,64,65,74. Most of these studies have been based on analyses of a priori defined regions of interest. The exact regions of alterations in diffusivity or anisotropic diffusion vary between studies, with some reporting greater anterior differences (e.g. 15) in AD, while others demonstrate posterior or temporal lobe changes in AD and MCI 33,39,46,64,65.\nThese conflicting results from prior studies may be due to multiple causes such as differences in sample composition (e.g., mild versus moderate cognitive impairment in AD; amnestic MCI versus MCI involving other cognitive domains), imaging technique (diffusion weighted 16,36,37,46,65 versus diffusion tensor imaging 15,33,39,64,68,74) or location of brain regions chosen for examination of MRI differences. Most studies used a region-of-interest (ROI) approach to examine MRI differences between groups. This approach can be subjective with inconsistent definitions of anatomical borders across studies 20 and poor reproducibility 3. Even when applied by trained individuals with established reliability and reproducibility, differential regional placement of ROIs across studies could contribute to inconsistent reports of differences in DTI indices.\nWhole-brain, voxel-based methods applied to the analysis of DTI differences between samples provide a global and comprehensive assessment un-complicated by the potential biases of ROI approaches. These techniques are automated and, therefore, are not subject to issues of human based tracing reliability andor reproducibility. In addition, voxel-based analyses assess regional changes in DTI parameters independent of a priori constraints and may reveal differences that are not encompassed by specific ROIs.\nIn the present study, we examined white matter changes in patients with probable mild AD and in those with amnestic MCI compared to controls using whole-brain, voxelbased analyses. We were especially interested in determining whether patients with MCI who are presumed to be in the preclinical phases of AD could be differentiated from elderly controls based on white matter changes. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use a whole brain analysis of white matter changes in MCI.",

Briefly, the evaluation incorporated the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD 57) procedures and included a medical history, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, informant interview and blood tests. The MRI scans of all participants in the present study were reviewed by a neuroradiologist to assess the presence of stroke or other exclusionary brain abnormalities. The clinical diagnosis of probable AD followed NINCDSADRDA guidelines 53; it required a history of cognitive decline and neuropsychological test evidence of impairment in at least two cognitive domains, one of which had to be memory.\nParticipants diagnosed with MCI underwent the same standard clinical evaluation as the patients with AD, were found to have a deficit in memory only, but did not meet criteria for dementia. Exclusion criteria for both patients with mild probable AD and MCI were evidence of other neurologic, psychiatric or systemic conditions that could cause cognitive impairment (e.g., stroke, tumor, alcoholism, major depression, a history of temporal lobe epilepsy).\nControl subjects received the same work-up as the two patient groups. Selection as an elderly control subject required a normal neurological examination, normal cognition and a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE 34) score 27. Exclusion criteria for the controls were the same as those used for the patient groups. Informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the rules of the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center.",

The first step in post-acquisition processing of diffusion tensor-MRI images (DT-MRI) involved the unwarping of eddy currents. Eddy currents are geometric distortions introduced by the echo planar diffusion weighting gradients and can cause distortions in shear, magnification andor pixel shifts. A set of CSF nulled inversion recovery images (T I  2100 ms) are acquired with b  0 as a reference for unwarping eddy current effects in the diffusion weighted images 25,38. Processing of unwarped DT images involved the calculation of the six diffusion coefficients defining the six elements of the diffusion tensor 9. Eigenvectors, defining the three principle directions of diffusion for each voxel were derived from the diffusion tensor. The magnitude of diffusivity in each direction was represented by the eigenvalues for the three eigenvectors. The mean diffusivity (DW) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the eigenvalues 789. From this post-processing, three values were constructed for each slice: DW, FA and b  0 (0 weighted image  T2 image).",

      "text": "Individual participant slice images for DW, FA and T2 acquisitions were concatenated into whole-brain volumes in acceptable format using software developed by Russ Poldrack, Ph.D. (http:sourceforge.netprojectsspm-toolbox). Whole-brain volumes were imported into Statistical Parametric Mapping software 35 (version SPM99) for analysis. To facilitate voxel-by-voxel comparisons between groups, all images were spatially normalized to a standard template. To avoid the geometric distortions associated with diffusion weighted echoplanar imaging, we used the 0 diffusion weighted (e.g., T2) image obtained during the scanning sequence for normalization. The T2 weighted image was normalized to the standard T2 template in SPM99 using a 12 iteration linear transformation and a non-linear transformation with 7  8  7 basis functions. The adequacy of transformation of each participants T2 weighted image to the T2 template was assessed by visual inspection. Parameters from this transformation were then applied to the remaining DT images and statistical maps were created for DW and FA values. This normalization processing re-sampled the volumes into a 2 mm 3 voxel size.\nTo limit our analysis to DW and FA values in white matter, we created individual subject mask volumes that were used to exclude voxels representing white matter abnormalities based on T2 signal, voxels from gray matter, CSF, and extra-cranial space. The first step in creating the masks was to segment the normalized T2 images into CSF, gray matter, and white matter compartments. The segmentation algorithms for defining white matter were based on a probability of greater than 0.80 for white matter classification. This process allowed us to not only exclude voxels from gray matter, CSF and extracranial space, but also to exclude areas of white matter in which the T2 signal was altered due to white matter lesions, atrophic changes or other abnormalities on an individual participant basis. Thus, only voxels surviving this threshold were included in the group analyses. The individual white mat- ter masks were then applied to individual subject DW and FA maps. Group differences in voxel level DTI values were assessed using these individual, masked DW and FA maps.",

For these comparisons, significance was determined with a p-value of 0.01 (corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level) with a seven-voxel extent threshold.\nDetermination of the location of voxels demonstrating significantly different DTI values was accomplished by converting the x, y, z coordinates for the peak voxel within a cluster from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates used in SPM99 analyses, to Talairach coordinates 69 using the MNItoTAL software (http:www.mrccbu.cam.akImagingmnispace.html).

In contrast, voxel-wise analysis of regional differences in white matter FA between the NC, MCI and AD groups using a p  0.01 threshold showed sig- nificant regional group differences. The majority of these were in posterior areas with few regions anterior to the anterior commissure. Approximately 13 of all voxels showing significant differences between the groups were in anterior regions and the remaining 87 were in posterior regions (12.7 anterior versus 87.3 posterior: χ 2 1  827, p  0.0001). NC versus MCI group contrasts revealed significant decrease in FA in the MCI participants in 12 regions Fig. 1. Representative regions of significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to age-matched healthy control participants. Three dimensional volumes were created from contiguous individual slices and normalized to a common standardized brain volume using SPM99 35.

Talairach locations of reduced anisotropy in posterior regions in MCI participants corresponded to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fibers underlying the superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate bundle, superior and posterior thalamic peduncles, sub-lobar extra-nuclear white matter, and the arcuate fibers of the superior temporal lobe at the temporal-parietal juncture.\nAnterior regions of decreased FA in the MCI participants were observed in bilateral sub-gyral cingulate gyrus and in the right sub-gyral frontal lobe. There were no regions with significantly increased FA in the MCI compared to NC participants.\nVoxel-wise group comparisons of FA differences between NC and AD participants revealed significantly reduced FA in the AD group in 14 regions (p  0.01) (see Table 3 and Fig. 2). Talairach locations of reduced anisotropy in AD compared to NC participants were similar to those found for participants with MCI. Specifically, posterior regions of reduced FA in patients with AD corresponded to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fibers underlying the superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate bundle, superior and posterior thalamic peduncles, sub-lobar extra-nuclear white matter, and fibers underlying the paracentral lobule. Anterior regions of decreased FA in the AD participants were observed in bilateral sub-gyral cingulate gyrus. There were no regions with significantly increased FA in the AD group compared to NC participants.\nTo assess the overlap in disturbances of anisotropic diffusion in MCI and AD groups, we examined regions of decreased FA unique to the NC versus AD contrast. There was a high degree of overlap in the MCI and AD groups, with only one region of significantly decreased FA in the AD group that was not demonstrated in the NC versus MCI contrast. The one unique region of decreased FA in the NC versus AD comparison was in the posterior cingulate sub-gyral white matter (voxel size  11, Z score  3.07, Talairach coordinates x: 16, y: -4, z: 46).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study we characterized in vivo changes in normal-appearing white matter microstructural integrity of participants with MCI and mild AD using whole brain diffusion tensor imaging. We found significant regional decreases of white matter anisotropy in the two patient groups compared to age-matched healthy controls in voxel-by-voxel comparisons. While no differences in regional molecular diffusion variables were detected between the MCI and mild AD groups, the anatomical pattern of white matter anisotropy changes (FA) was similar for both patient groups with greater posterior than anterior involvement. Moreover, decreases in posterior FA were not due to differential age or gender distributions among the groups, increased cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, myocardial infract, hypertension) in the cognitively impaired groups, or differential volume sizes of the DTI measures.\nOur results are consistent with those of previous studies demonstrating impaired white matter integrity in MCI and AD using diffusion weighted MRI. The published findings have been based on both diffusion weighted imaging 16,36,37,46,65, which does not develop a full tensor and is, thus, susceptible to artifacts from differential head positions, and diffusion tensor imaging 15,33,39,64,68,74, a technique that is invariant to head position. Most of the published studies on MCI and AD have inferred impaired white matter integrity from findings of both increased free-molecular diffusion (mean diffusivity) and decreased directional diffusion (anisotropic diffusion), although some studies have only reported increases in free-molecular diffusion 36,39,46 or have failed to find any significant differences 16.\nDiffusion weighted and diffusion tensor imaging studies have demonstrated various regional abnormalities of white matter integrity in patients with MCI and AD. The location of these anomalies differs across studies depending upon the exact placement of the ROIs. For example, some studies have investigated limited regions such as the corpus callosum 36, posterior cingulum 74, or temporal lobe regions 37, but others have investigated multiple ROIs in the frontal lobes, temporal lobes, cingulum, parietal lobes, and occipital lobes 15,16,33,39,46,64,65,68. The most consistent findings across studies are of impaired white matter integrity in the corpus callosum, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and the cingulum, with greater posterior than anterior involvement 39,65,68.\nThe variability of previous results may be due to multiple factors. These factors could include effects of different head positions in those studies that did not develop a position-invariant tensor, inclusion of MCI with mixed cognitive domain impairments, andor differential placement of ROIs across studies. In contrast to these potential influences Fig. 2. Representative regions of significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) compared to age-matched healthy control participants. Three dimensional volumes were created from contiguous individual slices and normalized to a common standardized brain volume using SPM99 35. Differences were analyzed using a two-sample t-test statistic. Significance thresholds were set for p  0.01. Voxels evidencing significant differences between groups are displayed on representative coronal sections on a canonical brain image. The color scale indicates the magnitude of Z values with lowest appearing in dark red and the highest in bright yellowwhite. The left side of the images represents the left side of the brain. on determination of anisotropic changes in MCI and AD, we developed position-invariant diffusion indexes derived from a full tensor, studied amnestic MCI only, and used a whole-brain voxel-based analytic method. Additionally, we separated the 0 diffusion weighted images (T2 relaxation time) into CSF, gray matter and white matter segments. The WM segment image was then applied to each individual DW and FA maps to avoid contamination of the DW or FA maps by elements other than white matter, such as hyperintensities, CSF, gray matter, and extra-cerebral matter. The exclusion of cortical gray matter decreases the potential artifact of echo planar distortions at brainairbone interfaces, most notable at the frontal pole and inferior temporal regions.\nIn our study, strikingly similar regions of decreased white matter integrity were found in the MCI and AD groups, with most regions of significantly decreased FA located posterior to the anterior commissure. The presence of these regional alterations in MCI that are shared by participants with AD are consistent with findings in volumetric studies of gray matter changes, in which specific patterns of mesial temporal atrophy are seen in both groups and can predict longitudinally the conversion from MCI to AD 27,29,47,48.\nThe present results demonstrate significantly decreased FA in the fasciculi of the cortico-thalamic and thalamocortical connections through the internal capsule (superior and posterior thalamic peduncles) in both MCI and AD compared to controls. Additionally, the white matter fibers located deep in the posterior white matter, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the posterior cingulum bundle, were particularly affected in patients with AD and MCI compared to controls. Indeed, the only region showing decreased white matter integrity unique to the AD group was in the posterior cingulum bundle.\nSpecific interest has been given to the cingulum bundle in DTI investigations of WM integrity in patients with AD because of the existing evidence of the early involvement of the posterior cingulate in the progression of the disease. Neuropathological, MRI-volumetric 21, and especially brain metabolism studies 56,62,63,71 have indicated that the posterior cingulate is involved very early in the course of AD. Moreover, behavioral measures of mental status are significantly correlated with DTI-based diffusion values in the posterior cingulate gyrus among patients with AD 74.\nThe underlying white matter pathway of the cingulate gyrus is an important part of the cholinergic system 66. Alterations of the cholinergic system in AD results from the loss of neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), with a subsequent depletion of cortical acetylcholine and cholinergic fibers 54,55. Additionally, a significant relationship between the presence of WMH in the cholinergic pathways and level of cognitive impairment has been reported with the severity of WMH in cholinergic fibers accounting for a specific impairment in executive functions, regardless of an equivalent global cognitive impairment rating 67. Thus, our finding of decreased FA in the cingulum bundles in MCI and AD compared to NC could reflect increased vulnerability of this cortical cognitive system to damage of cholinergic pathways in incipient AD, as well as progressive damage in this region in those with AD.\nThe alterations in the microstructural integrity of normalappearing WM in AD and MCI found in the present study may represent a complex result of co-existing pathological processes. One pathological process contributing to decreased anisotropy in cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical white matter tracts may be the presence of subclinical ischemic changes. Vascular risk factors and ischemic events, common in the elderly population, are known to increase the risk of AD 44. As indicated in the introduction, alterations in microvasculature are commonly seen in brains of patients with AD 45. In addition, there may be white matter rarefaction with axonal damage and gliosis 31. In the present study however, the occurrence of clinically relevant cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, myocardial infarct, hypertension) was similar across the three groups.\nAnother pathological process contributing to the loss of white matter integrity in MCI and AD may be increased susceptibility of oligodendrocytes to free-radical and other metabolic damage 4. According to this theory, later myelinated regions (cortical association areas) have fewer oligodendrocytes supporting greater numbers of axons compared to earlier myelinated regions (primary cortical regions). Because of the high metabolic demands of oligodendrocytes in the cortical association areas needed to maintain the widely distributed axons, formation of ferritin-released iron is increased and may amplify pathological processes due to oxidative stress. These, and other metabolic processes may lead to decreased white matter integrity in association cortical regions due to damage to the supporting oligodendrocytes. In general, our findings of decreased white matter integrity in later-mylenating regions in patients with MCI and AD support this hypothesis.\nIn the early stages of AD, there is increased gray matter pathology in posterior brain regions relative to anterior regions 1,17. Our finding of decreased posterior DTI indices of white matter integrity in MCI and early AD demonstrates that this pathological process occurs in white matter as well. The white matter changes in the cognitively impaired groups are independent of the presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, myocardial infarct or hypertension and cannot be accounted for by differences in age distributions between the groups. Therefore, our results suggest that posterior white matter damage is specific to the pathological processes of AD. The occurrence of significant regional changes of whole brain WM anisotropy in both MCI and AD groups, compared to controls, suggests that posterior regional anisotropy changes in normal-appearing white matter of patients with MCI could occur before the onset of overt dementia and may play a role in the progression towards AD.",

    "abstract": "for the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive TrialData Sharing Alzheimer (MAPTDSA) Study Group BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional associations have been found between frail individuals and worse white matter (WM) integrity. However, the prospective association between WM integrity and frailty is still unclear. Our objectives were to measure associations between WM integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the 5-year worsening of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). SETTING: Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (mean age  74.7 AE 3.9 years) with no dementia at baseline who had functional magnetic resonance imaging performed as part of the MAPT study (n  227). MEASUREMENTS: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were acquired for 10 different brain regions. Frailty was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype (score from 0 to 5, higher is worse) at up to seven time points for 5 years. Mixed effect ordinal logistic regression model was used to assess the prospective association between DTI parameters (independent variables) and frailty (dependent variable). All the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline total intracranial volume, and the presence of one of the following cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, andor hypercholesterolemia). RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between the RD, AxD, and MD for different brain regions (anterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, superior frontal occipital fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) and worsening of frailty over 5 years after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that WM integrity is associated with frailty in older adults. The mechanisms related to these results require further investigation.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "F railty is a geriatric condition that is common in later life 1 and is associated with increased adverse health events, 2 such as falls, 3 hospitalization, 4 and mortality. 5 It is a prevalent condition that increases with age (12 in people aged 70-79 years to 60 in those aged 90 years), 6 and is being considered a major public health concern. 7 The mechanisms underlying the development of this condition are complex, but seem to include a decrease in brain health. 2,8 To date, many studies have reported crosssectional 9101112131415 and prospective 16,17 associations between brain health and frailty. Markers of cerebral damage, which are used to measure brain health and that are precursors of future dementia, were found to be associated with frailty: brain amyloid load 15,17 and white matter lesions (WMLs). 9,12131418 A previous study by our group found that a higher volume of WMLs increases the risk of developing frailty in the future. 16 Since WMLs are a precursor for the loss of microstructural integrity, 19 examining the relationship between this deterioration and frailty could provide useful information regarding the evolution of brain health and its impact on frailty in older adults.\nMicrostructural integrity of white matter (WM) is measured primarily by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which can provide information on the integrity of WM fibers. 20 To date, only one cross-sectional study investigated the associations between frailty and WM integrity using DTI technique (fractional anisotropy FA and mean diffusivity MD). In this study, the authors found that frail older individuals had higher MD in the corpus callosum, anterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, and the posterior thalamic regions. 9 Cross-sectional associations were also found between slow gait speed and lower Short Physical Performance Battery scores, with lower WM integrity measured with FA and MD. 212223 Thus, it seems that perturbations in WM integrity are present in people with frailty syndrome-related disabilities, but the available evidence cannot tease out the direction of the association. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the prospective associations between DTI parameters and frailty in community-dwelling older adults. Examining the prospective associations between brain health and frailty will help us better understand the potential implications of brain microstructural changes and the trajectory of frailty.\nThe objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to explore the prospective associations between DTI parameters and frailty worsening and (2) to determine if people with a rapid deterioration of DTI parameters would have a worsening of frailty compared to those with a slowno deterioration progression.",

      "text": "This study used the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) study (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00672685), assessed using the DTI technique. The MAPT study consisted of a 3-year multidomain intervention that consisted of four conditions 24 (1) multidomain (physical and nutritional counseling and cognitive training) combined with omega-3 supplementation, (2) a multidomain intervention with placebo, (3) an omega-3 supplementation intervention, and (4) a control group. The results of the MAPT study showed no significant effect of the interventions on cognitive function over the course of 3 years. 25 An observational follow-up was also performed 2 years after the end of MAPT interventions, and data from this observational period were also used for this study. The MAPT and the MRI ancillary study were conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the ethics committee in Toulouse (Comité de protection des personnes Sud Ouest et Outre mer (CPP SOOM) II).

The 1680 randomized participants in the MAPT study were invited to participate in the MRI-MAPT ancillary study. In total, 503 agreed to take part in this study and underwent different MRI scans (threedimensional tissue imaging 3DTI, T2-weighted fluidattenuated inversion recovery T2FLAIR, T2-turbo spin echo T2TSE, and T2-weighted gradient-echo T2GRE) with the option to undergo the functional MRI (fMRI) and DTI measurements. 24 In total, 227 participants had a baseline DTI analysis and 110 had data at baseline and 5 years.

      "text": "The first MRI assessment was performed within the first 12 months of each the participants enrollment in the study (mean  107 days; SD  AE97 days). The follow-up MRIs were performed during the 3-and 5-year visits. The MRI was performed using a standardized protocol common to all centers (Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Limoges, Dijon, Lyon, Foix, Tarbes, and Nice). First, the protocol included a scan with the required sequences (3DT1, T2FLAIR, T2TSE, and T2GRE) and optional sequences: resting state fMRI and DTI. The centers were also required to test this protocol on volunteers before the enrollment of the MAPT participants. The images were then sent to the MRI coordinating center (CATI and Cogimage), which provided the required quality certificates. Preliminary quality controls were performed at the coordinating center by a trained researcher to assess if the participants required rescanning. The total intracranial brain volume (cm 3 ) was computed from the baseline three-dimensional T1-weighted sequence using the SPM5 toolbox (fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspm).",

    "DTI Acquisition and Analyses": {
      "text": "Image processing was performed following the standard ENIGMA DTI pipeline (http:enigma.ini.usc.eduprotocols dti-protocols). Diffusion images were first processed to correct for different artifacts: susceptibility-based distortions were corrected using BrainSuite registration-based correction method and eddy currents, and subjects movement artifacts were corrected using FSL eddy tool. FreeSurfer and FSL bet2 tools were also respectively used to compute anatomical and diffusion volume brain masks. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis was then performed using ENIGMA-DTI target brain and FA skeleton templates (downloadable at http:enigma.ini.usc.eduwp-content uploads201302enigmaDTI.zip). Each subjects FA was registered to the target brain and then projected using TBSS algorithm on the Enigma skeleton template. Regions of interests (ROIs) from the John Hopkins University WM parcellation atlas 26 were then intersected with each subjects scalar skeleton, and DTI scalar values were averaged for each region. The ROI atlas is available with FSL 5.0.11 standard data (https:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwikiAtlases). FA and radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and MD were analyzed across the different time points and regions (corona radiata, internal capsule, corpus callosum, external capsule, thalamic radiation, occipital fasciculus, and the longitudinal fasciculus), averaging left and right hemispheres. These ROIs were selected because of their known associations between WM integrity with frailty and gait function, a component of frailty. 9,21,27 FA represents the degree of directionality of water diffusion along WM fibers, with higher directionality representing a better structural integrity of WM fibers (from 0 to 1). MD represents a global measure of water diffusion, with a higher MD indicating worse structural integrity.",

To examine the prospective relationship between baseline DTI parameters (FA, MD, RD, and AxD) and frailty phenotype, mixed-effect ordered logistic regression models (random effect on the participant, research center, and time) with adjustments for all confounders were performed. A similar model for the speed of progression (faster progression vs slow progression) was also performed. To do so, we computed the differences for each region of the DTI measures between baseline and 5 years and we categorized the participants who were in the worst quartile as fast progressors (ie, 0  slow progressors, and 1  fast progressors). More specifically, participants who were in the lowest quartile of the 5-year change of FA and diffusivity values were categorized as fast progressors of worsening DTI parameters (25th percentile for FA, 75th percentile for MD). This procedure was performed for each brain region. Sensitivity analysis by adding WML in the model was performed (Supplementary Tables S1 andS2). All P values are presented before and after adjustments for multiple comparisons (based on Hochberg procedure 31,32 ) at the two-tailed 5 significance level. All analyses were performed using Stata 14.1 for Mac. In this study, the values of MD, AxD, and RD were increased to mm 2 s instead of 10 -3 μm 2 s.

Participants had a mean age of 74.7 years (AE3.9 years; 70-86 years old). Of the sample, 60 were women, and 55 of the participants were robust, defined by the Fried frailty phenotype (05). The average Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28.1, with 46 having a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 0.5 at baseline.\nProspective associations are illustrated in Figure 1, and the detailed results are presented in Supplementary Tables S3 andS4. Mixed-effect ordinal logistic regression found that baseline diffusivity values of the anterior limb of the internal capsule (MD: adjusted P  .024), external capsule (MD: adjusted P  .020; AxD: adjusted P  .010; RD: adjusted P  .010), posterior corona radiata (MD: adjusted P  .040), posterior thalamic radiation (MD: adjusted P  .048; RD: adjusted P  .024), superior corona radiata (MD: adjusted P  .037; AxD: adjusted P  .001; RD: adjusted P  .010), superior frontal occipital fasciculus (MD: adjusted P  .048), and superior longitudinal fasciculus regions (MD: adjusted P  .002; AxD: adjusted P  .020; RD: adjusted P  .013) were all associated with worsening of frailty phenotype over 5 years, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Nonsignificant associations between the FA parameter and frailty were found.\nThe fast deterioration associations are illustrated in Figure 2, and the detailed results are presented in Supplementary Tables S5 andS6. Participants baseline characteristics with MRI follow-up included in these analyses are provided in Supplementary Table S7. At baseline, participants did not differ as compared to the total sample. Fast deterioration of the RD of the superior corona radiata was found to be associated with worsening frailty, but this association was lost after multiple comparisons (adjusted P  .080). No other significant associations were found. In regards to the sensitivity analysis when adding WML as a cofounder (Supplementary Tables S1 andS2), we only found nonsignificant trends for the MD, AxD, and RD of the external capsule and the anterior corona radiata (adjusted P  .05).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to investigate brain microstructure integrity parameters assessed by DTI in different brain regions. Our results showed that a decrease in RD, AxD, and MD in different brain regions is associated with an increased frailty worsening in older adults.\nTo date, only one cross-sectional study found higher MD values in the corpus callosum, the anterior limb of internal capsule, the external capsule, and the posterior thalamic radiation in frail older adults compared to robust individuals. 9 In accordance with these findings, our study showed that the external capsule, the posterior thalamic radiation, and the anterior limb of internal capsule were all prospectively associated with frailty; these regions are known to be associated with gait asymmetry 27 and sensorimotor 36 and motor functions. 37 Our results further extend the current literature by showing prospective relationships in other regions, such as the corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the superior frontal occipital fasciculus regions. The corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus regions are both known to play a role in information processing, executive function, and motor control, 38 and these domains play a crucial role on physical function. 39,40 In line with this, recent research has found that the superior longitudinal fasciculus region is also associated with gait speed 22 and the superior frontal occipital fasciculus plays a role in spatial cognition. 41 Whether this region is important in frailty is still mitigated, but spatial cognition can play a role in gait performance. 42 Based on these results and others, 9,23 WM integrity seems to be an important biomarker for frailty worsening.\nAs of now, it remains uncertain how the disorganization of the WM tracts in these regions is associated with increased risk of frailty. Since WM integrity is important for gait and motor function, we can hypothesize that a loss in WM integrity can lead to decreased motor function and eventually frailty. We only found associations with diffusivity parameters but not with FA. This may be explained by the fact that FA varies widely in different regions of the brain, and the presence of multiple fibers in one voxel could not reflect necessarily structural integrity. 43 Whereas diffusivity is not affected by fiber crossing, it remains relatively constant between regions. 43 When adding WML in the model, all associations were lost. Based on the results by Verwer et al, 23 who found that decreased WM integrity was associated with slow gait speed, independently of WML, we expected the associations between DTI parameters and frailty would follow a similar pattern. However, when WML was added to the models, all significant associations became nonsignificant. It is important to highlight that frailty is a geriatric condition characterized not only by motor function, but also by other elements, including behavioral components (ie, physical activity). 2 Therefore, although DTI parameters have been shown to be associated with motor function, 44,45 their links with other determinants of frailty are less clear, in particular for physical activity, weight loss, and fatigue. Regardless, more studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms between WM integrity and its impact on functional status in older adults.\nIn this study, no associations between the speed of progression of DTI parameters and the worsening of frailty when adjusting for multiple comparisons were found. This finding may be explained by the lack of a robust definition in determining what may represent a fast decline on DTI parameters that are linked to clinically meaningful outcomes. Nonetheless, it is still unclear what may represent a fast decline on DTI parameters that could lead to clinically meaningful symptoms. Additional studies are needed to define this concept of rapid progression of damage in WM integrity and explore how this can affect frailty.\nThis study has important strengths. First, this is the longest and largest study using a sample of communitydwelling older adults looking at the prospective associations between DTI parameters and frailty. Second, frailty was measured at various time points for 5 years, which provided us with a more precise trajectory of frailty. Some limitations need to be acknowledged. First, three-quarters of our study population received a multidomain intervention, omega-3 supplementation, or both, which might have influenced our results. In an attempt to minimize the impact of this bias, we adjusted all the analyses by MAPT group allocation. Second, we performed an ROI-based approach of DTI parameters rather than a voxel-based approach, which could limit the scope of this study. Third, the use of percentiles to define the speed of progression of DTI parameters may not be the best marker of speed of progression.\nTo conclude, this study provides evidence that worsening of MD in regions that are related to executive functioning is associated with the 5-year progression of frailty worsening in community-dwelling older adults. Caution is warranted when interpreting the implications of the results. Additional studies using biomarkers, such as inflammation and brain metabolism, are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms between WM integrity and its association with the frailty phenotype.",

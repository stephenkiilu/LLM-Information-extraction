    "abstract": "White matter (WM) changes, along with well-characterized cortical abnormalities, occur in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). We investigated the integrity of WM tracts within association fibers by the use of fractional anisotropy (FA), and the relationship between FA values and cognitive function in patients with AD. Neuropsychological examination and conventional MRI, as well as diffusion tensor imaging, (DTI) were conducted on 12 patients with mild to moderate AD and 18 cognitively healthy volunteers. DTI was performed to measure FA in the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) values were used to evaluate cognitive function and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale was used as a staging tool for dementia severity. FA measures were analyzed and correlated with neuropsychological data. No patient showed any WM tract abnormality on either T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI. However, the FA values in the bilateral IFOF and SLF and the MoCA scores in patients with AD were significantly decreased (p  0.05) compared to the controls. Furthermore, the decreased FA values in the SLF were positively correlated with cognitive function (MMSE scores -right: r  0.672, p  0.033, left: r  0.919, p  0.01; MoCA values -right: r  0.747, p  0.013, left: r  0.679, p  0.031). Our findings confirmed that the loss of integrity of microstructural WM connectivity has a role in the cognitive decline of patients with AD. The data also suggest that the FA values of the SLF may be used as a clinical marker of cognitive function.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized pathologically by a reduction in the number of large cortical neurons, and by the accumulation of extracellular, insoluble beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques along with intracytoplasmic tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles. 1 The patients present mainly with memory decline and other associated cognitive dysfunction. In the living subjects, the diagnosis of possible or probable AD is usually made using clinical, laboratory, and structural imaging evidence. The confirmatory diagnosis of AD is made by means of histopathological examination of the tissue derived from autopsy or brain biopsy. 2 In recent years, radiologic imaging has had an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of AD. Structural brain imaging along with functional imaging (functional MRI fMRI and positron emission tomography PET) has been used to investigate the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in patients with AD with varying results. 3,4 The conventional structural MRI demonstrates gray matter atrophy 567 in patients with AD and cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in ischemic vascular disease, such as stroke. 8 However, when the WMH are mild, there may be no abnormalities seen on structural imaging and structural MRI is also relatively insensitive to microstructural lesions. Also, the orientation abnormalities in the normal-appearing WM may be clinically important in pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in AD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a quantitative MRI technique that measures the directionality and mobility of water diffusion in tissue and is a powerful tool for studying the structural integrity of WM fibers that connect cortical regions. 9 It reflects the size, orientation, and organization of WM tracts non-invasively and can also be used to assess microstructural properties of WM. 10 There are several metrics that can be calculated from DTI scans, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and three eigen values (k1, k2, and k3), the two most commonly assessed being MD and FA. As an index of the degree of anisotropy, we used FA (scaled from 0 to 1) 11 which can be calculated by the formula:\nIf diffusion is isotropic (k1  k2  k3), this measure becomes 0 and 1, representing complete directional diffusion (anisotropic diffusion). In WM, high FA may be seen when the direction of diffusion is parallel to the myelin. Damage to the WM, such as demyelination or axonal damage, breaks down the organized structure leading to a decrease in FA. The reduction of FA values suggests a reduction in axon number, an impairment of axonal flow, or both. As such, measures of FA provide an in vivo marker of cerebral integrity. 12,13 Studies conducted using DTI have also reported reduced FA in patients with established AD, within the brain lobes, interhemispheric corticocortical fibers 14,15 and the association fibers 161718 using automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the conventional region-of-interest (ROI) technique. But, to date, the relationship between WM impairment and cognitive function has not been well investigated. We hypothesized that there would be reductions in FA of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) within the longer association fibers in patients with mild to moderate AD and that the reduction of the FA values in these regions may be positively correlated with cognitive function.",

    "DTI data post-processing": {
      "text": "Before the scan was performed, every subject was well instructed and their heads were mounted to decrease the extent of the distortion and involuntary motion induced by eddy current of the DTI images. All the DTI datasets were transferred to a personal computer running on a Windows platform and were processed using MRI Studio software (https:www.mristudio.org wikiinstallation) to generate format images from the raw Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images. Analyses were run on MATLAB 6.5 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The raw DICOM data were converted into four analysis files (e.g. .img or .hdr) by MRI Studio. In order to find the ROI, we used a non-local registration method. 202122 Let f ðx; yÞ and gðx; yÞ represent test and atlas images. If the brightness constancy assumption holds, and the images are related by an affine transformation, then:\nwhere m i, i  1,...,4 form the 2Â2 affine matrix and the 2Â1 translation vector. These parameters are estimated locally for each small spatial neighborhood, but for notational convenience their spatial parameters are dropped. In order to estimate these parameters, we use the following quadratic error function to be minimized:\nEðmÞ ¼ Z Z ½ðf ðx; yÞ À gðx; yÞÞ 2 dxdy where m ¼ jðm 1 ; m 2 ; m 3 ; m 4 ; t x ; t y Þ. Since this error function is non-linear in its unknowns, it cannot be minimized analytically. To simplify the minimization, we approximate this error function using a first-order truncated Taylor series expansion:\nwhere f x , f y , g x , g y are the spatial derivatives of f and g with respect to x and y. The estimation from the error function is improved using a Newton-Raphson style iterative scheme. The required spatiotemporal derivatives have finite support, thus fundamentally limiting the amount of motion that can be estimated. A coarse-to-fine scheme was adopted to contend with larger motion. A Gaussian pyramid was built for both images and the affine parameters were first estimated at the coarsest level. The estimated parameters were then used in the next level to warp the test image, and the parameters were re-estimated. 202122 ROI were placed bilaterally in the brightest and the normal appearing WM of the SLF (one ROI, 2Â3 pixels, Supplementary Fig. 1B) and the IFOF (three ROI: one frontal, one frontotemporal, one temporal, 2Â3 pixels, Supplementary Fig. 1A) on the FA images. For these regions, we used the ROI designations described by Fellgiebel et al. 18 The conventional method defines the ROI manually even when applied by trained individuals with established reliability and reproducibility -differential regional placement of ROI across studies could contribute to inconsistent reports of differences in DTI indices. To achieve standardized results and avoid subjectivity, an experienced radiologist (X.H.), blinded to subject information including diagnosis, performed the ROI segment. To determine reliability of the results, we applied the non-local registration method using the ROI in the reference DTI as the atlas to find the results automatically in the analyzed DTI. The same rater repeated ROI segments on 20 randomly selected subjects, blinded to the previous readings. Reliability, expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient, was 0.9.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We used a ROI-based analysis of FA maps to detect the integrity of the association fiber tracts and its relationship to cognitive function in mild to moderate AD. Two main findings were noted in the present study. First, disturbances were found in the bilateral IFOF and the SLF compared to normal aging. Second, significant correlations were observed between the integrity of SLF and cognitive function in patients with AD.\nThe major finding of this study is that the decreased FA values of the bilateral SLF and IFOF correlated to impairment on neuropsychology measures without obvious structural changes on both T1-weighted MRI and T2-weighted MRI. The SLF is a massive bundle and a bidirectional pathway in humans, which originates from the prefrontal cortex and runs back to the posterior parietal region 23 , connecting the frontal lobe cortex to parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe cortices. The functions of the SLF in the dominant hemisphere and the non-dominant hemisphere are dissimilar. 24 Functional impairment of the left SLF may include conduction aphasia and speech disturbances such as anomia. 25 This could explain why some patients with AD were abnormal on the confrontation naming test in the MoCA. In addition, it has been previously shown that, in humans, lesions in the right SLF may provoke visuospatial and attention dysfunction. 26 This is also partly consistent with the clock drawing task and the cube copy test in the MoCA. There is little evidence corroborating lesion-induced deficits restricted to the IFOF. The IFOF connects the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the posterior temporal cortex, and the occipital lobe has a role in visual spatial processing, object recognition, and memory. 27,28 The decreased anisotropy of patients with AD measured as FA values for the SLF and IFOF suggests that forms of cognitive dysfunction may result from the impairment of the highly interconnected neural circuits encompassing the remote cortices. It also supports the disconnection syndrome hypothesis of AD. 29 The reduction in the FA values indicates a reduction in axon number, an impairment of axonal flow, or both. The regional FA reductions that we found in this study likely reflect WM changes due to the underlying pathological processes, such as demyelination, axonal loss, and Ab deposition. In the present study, the conventional MRI did not show any abnormalities in either AD or control subjects; these findings may represent WM changes caused purely by AD pathology. It also suggests that conventional MRI indices of WM are inadequate to assess the neuropathology in AD. DTI is a measure of the integrity of WM and a means of assessing microstructual WM pathology that impairs cognitive function. However, further studies are necessary for detecting significant WM changes and the corresponding neuropathology.\nIn addition, we demonstrated a significantly disturbed bilateral SLF integrity that correlated with global cognitive functioning (MMSE and MoCA), thus showing that the SLF FA may be used as a marker that reflects the severity of the cognitive function. However, no correlations were found between the IFOF FA and the neuropsychological examination scores. We think this may have been because the WM changes in these areas are not as strongly related to the disease-specific cognitive decline as in the SLF. Another explanation is that we were able to cover only a small sample of the extensive complex of fiber bundles using the ROI-based approach.\nOther studies showed varying results in changes to WM. Fellgiebel et al. 18 reported significantly reduced FA in IFOF bilaterally whereas FA values of the SLF did not show a statistically significant difference between patients and controls. Xie et al. 12 and Takahashi et al. 14 found reduced FA in the temporal lobe areas and the SLF. Variations in these results can be explained by possible differences in: (i) sample sizes; (ii) post-processing methods of DTI data; (iii) equipment and scan parameters; (iv) selection method of the ROI, so that the regional ROI may not reflect the integrity of the entire fiber bundle; (v) severity of AD in the patients. Different results have also been reported with respect to the correlation between neuropsychological examination and DTI parameters. In our study, the FA values of the bilateral SLF showed positive correlation with the MMSE and MoCA scores. Previously, Rose et al 30 reported that the FA values of the parahippocampal region, right thalamus and left cingulate fasciculus showed correlation with MMSE scores in 17 patients with mild cognitive impairment, but Naggara et al. 31 did not find any correlations between the neuropsychological examination and the DTI parameters. However, the neuropsychological tests for cognitive function may lack specific examinations for cognitive function.\nThere were some limitations of our study. First, we could not examine the histopathological characteristics of our patients, which would inevitably make the interpretation of abnormalities of the changes in observed FA values challenging. The second limitation was the relatively small sample size which may have biased some of our results. Future work with larger numbers of patients with AD and controls is necessary and may provide more information on the significance of WM changes. Finally, the diagnostic criteria of AD at different stages may be different on imaging. A longitudinal study, which was also a part of our study, will improve the relevance of the results.",

      "text": "DTI provides a more direct assessment of the neuroanatomical configuration of WM fiber tracts. We found significant microstructural changes of WM tracts in the SLF and IFOF.

As well as further studies on FA values, we recommend the use of combinations of functional neuroimaging and other clinical indexes studies.",

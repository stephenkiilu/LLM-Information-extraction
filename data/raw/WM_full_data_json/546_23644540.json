    "abstract": "Introduction Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied to characterize the pathological features of Alzheimers disease (AD) in a mouse model, although little is known about whether these features are structure specific. Voxelbased analysis (VBA) and atlas-based analysis (ABA) are good complementary tools for whole-brain DTI analysis. The purpose of this study was to identify the spatial localization of disease-related pathology in an AD mouse model. Methods VBA and ABA quantification were used for the whole-brain DTI analysis of nine APPPS1 mice and wildtype (WT) controls. Multiple scalar measurements, including fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR), were investigated to capture the various types of pathology. The accuracy of the image transformation applied for VBA and ABA was evaluated by comparing manual and atlas-based structure delineation using kappa statistics. Following the MR examination, the brains of the animals were analyzed for microscopy. Results Extensive anatomical alterations were identified in APPPS1 mice, in both the gray matter areas (neocortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, claustrum, amygdala, and piriform cortex) and the white matter areas (corpus callosumexternal capsule, cingulum, septum, internal capsule, fimbria, and optic tract), evidenced by an increase in FA or DA, or both, compared to WT mice (p 0.05, corrected). The average kappa value between manual and atlas-based structure delineation was approximately 0.8, and there was no significant difference between APPPS1 and WT mice (p0.05). The histopathological changes in the gray matter areas were confirmed by microscopy studies. DTI did, however, demonstrate significant changes in white matter areas, where the difference was not apparent by qualitative observation of a single-slice histological specimen. Conclusion This study demonstrated the structure-specific nature of pathological changes in APPPS1 mouse, and also showed the feasibility of applying whole-brain analysis methods to the investigation of an AD mouse model.",

To investigate the genetic and histopathological background of the disease cascade, as well as to examine potential interventions that might lead to disease modification, several types of mouse models have been created. Among them, mice expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilins (PS) 1 and 2 human mutations (APPPS transgenic mice) that produce accelerated amyloid deposition have been widely used. There is already a substantial amount of literature about the histologic findings in APPPS mice, such as reduced neuron numbers and Aβ deposits 2,3. The next challenge is to investigate longitudinal pathologic changes and to observe the effect of intervention. This requires an in vivo evaluation of the pathological changes in the brain, in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI method by which the alterations in water diffusion can be quantified both in the gray matter and the white matter of AD patients 4. In the AD mouse model, abnormalities were found in the white matter areas, such as the corpus callosumexternal capsule (CCEC), the optic tract, the anterior commissure, and the fornix, and also in the gray matter structures, including the neocortex and the hippocampus 5,6. However, previous studies were mostly based on measurements from a limited number of pre-determined regions-of-interest (ROI) following an a priori hypothesis. Since the histopathological abnormality in AD begins from a limited area and then widely distributes to the entire brain, whole-brain analysis is essential to comprehensively capture the pathological features.\nVoxel-based and atlas-based image analysis methods are both widely used for whole-brain analysis. In voxel-based group analysis (VBA), voxel-based statistics are obtained from a group of brains normalized to a template space. This method is suitable for localizing areas with disease-related abnormalities in a hypothesis-independent way. However, VBA is not sensitive for the detection of small but widely distributed changes in image intensities 7. Atlas-based analysis (ABA), in which statistical analysis is obtained based on anatomical units 8, is sensitive for the detection of small changes that are widely distributed to anatomical units 4,9. However, ABA is not suitable for detecting changes limited to a small portion of the anatomical structure, or for identifying pathologies that do not follow the anatomical boundaries defined in the atlas. Considering that the pathological changes in AD follow anatomical units (e.g., limbic fibers), VBA and ABA seem to be good complementary tools for whole-brain analysis 10.\nIn this study, we attempted to apply VBA and ABA to the whole-brain DTI analysis of APPPS1 transgenic mice to identify the spatial localization of disease-related pathology and to quantify the severity. Multiple scalar measurements, including fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR), were investigated to capture the various types of pathology related to AD. In addition, the volume of 46 anatomical structures was measured, based on ABA. To support the structure-specific abnormalities found by DTI, we also performed some preliminary histology assessments after the scans.",

A subsequent registration process was performed using DiffeoMap (www.MriStudio.org), following the method published previously 8. Briefly, a subjects mean B0 image (the average of the five B0 images) was first registered to the templates T2-weighted image using a 12-parameter affine transformation of AIR. The resulting matrix was then used to transform the FA and the trace image. After the initial linear transformation, the FA and trace image were further transformed non-linearly to the template using dual-contrast large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) 14. Because of the scan coverage problem, we cropped the template and subject image before non-linear transformation. The overall coverage of the mid-sagittal plane was from the anterior part of the corpus callosum to the posterior part of the corpus callosum. The two alpha values of diffeomorphic transformation, 0.01 and 0.005, were sequentially applied to ensure both the general and local accuracy of the registration 15. Once completed, the transformation matrix was applied to the co-registered tensor fields using a method described by 16.

Compared with WT mice, we found these significant pathological changes in APPPS1 mice: (1) amyloid plaque deposition and microgliosis-the asterisks in b1 show amyloid plaques without definite boundaries, surrounded by dystrophic neuritis (DN), and the black arrow in b1 indicates a microglia laden with DN fragments;\n(2) astrocyte hypertrophy-the perivascular space was dilated significantly in APPPS1 mice due to the swollen glia processes (asterisks, b2); (3) neural apoptosis-the black arrows in b3 mark the boundaries of a shrinking neuron; and (4) neuronal process changes-widespread swelling of the neuronal processes was observed (asterisks, b4), as well as axon loss and swollen axons (asterisks, b5). In addition to points 1-4 above, modest demyelination was found in APPPS1 mice. Black arrows in b5 and b6 indicate subtle focal myelin separation with a normal myelin capsule.\nComparisons among VBA, ABA, and histological findings A summary of the DTI findings and histological findings can be found in Table 1. DTI detected extensive alterations in both gray matter and white matter structures. VBA detected changes limited to small portions of the anatomical structures, such as the anteromedial portion of the hippocampus, the medial portion of the hypothalamus, the inferior portion of the right amygdala, the lateral portion of the right piriform cortex, and the anterior inferior portion of the claustrum, while ABA could not detect these changes. However, ABA detected small but widely distributed changes in the anatomical structures, such as the cingulum and the optic tract, while VBA could not. The histopathological changes in the neocortex and the hippocampus were confirmed by an optical microscopy study and an electron microscopy study. DTI did, however, demonstrate significant changes in white matter areas, where the difference was not apparent by qualitative observation of a single-slice histological specimen.\nAdditional ROIs analysis in native data space Since extensive FA increases were observed, based on VBA and ABA analysis, an additional ROI analysis in native data space was undertaken to resolve this discrepancy with the results of previous studies. Ten typical brain regions reported in previous studies, including the left hippocampus, right hippocampus, left neocortex, right neocortex, left corpus callosumexternal capsule, right corpus callosumexternal capsule, left internal capsule, right internal capsule, left optic tract, and right optic tract, were chosen as ROIs in this analysis. The FA value of these ROIs in the APPPS1 mice group and wild type group were measured on FA maps by an author (S.Z.) who was blinded to the categories of disease. The data from each group is shown in Table 2, from which we can see that FA values in the native data space of the APPPS1 mice group were always higher than those of the WT controls, in line with the results based on VBA and ABA methods.",

To sensitively detect both localized and widespread pathologies, we applied two types of complementary analysis methods: VBA and ABA. The VBA could detect changes localized to a small portion of the hippocampus, hypothalamus, claustrum, amygdala, and piriform cortex, while ABA detected mildly but widespread changes in the cingulum and optic tract. There were increases in the FA or DA, or both, in these areas, compared to WT controls.",

    "Findings in the neocortex and hippocampus": {
      "text": "The larger DA increases with the milder DR increases (in Supplementary Table A, the percent of DA increase was always higher than that of DR), which resulted in an increase in the FA and trace, were the prominent features in the neocortex and hippocampus. This result is in contrast to previous DTI findings in a mouse model of AD with a milder AD-like phenotype, APPsw mice, which showed a reduced DA in the neocortex and hippocampus 6. The histopathological differences between APPPS1 and APPsw mice included earlier and more severe Aβ deposition and more significant neuronal loss in APPPS1 mice. The background strain and transgene variations are relevant to pathophysiological development 21, which may result in different diffusivity changes. In general, it has been shown that degeneration usually results in a decrease of FA in the lesioned regions 22,23. However, the phenomenon of increased FA in the basal forebrain has recently been attributed to a loss of isotropic cells, which then leads to a greater contribution from residual anisotropic cellsaxons 24. The decrease in the proportion of unmyelinated fibers relative to myelinated fibers may contribute to the significant increases both in the overall diffusivity and the DR. Considering this, the extensive neuron loss observed in this study may explain the changes in FA in the neocortex and hippocampus. Loss of neurons in the hippocampus has also been shown to relate to water diffusion increases in AD patients 25. In addition, significant trace and DR increases were also observed in the neocortex and hippocampus in this study, in line with the observations from 24.\nAnother issue that should be addressed is the interactions between aging and AD-related neurodegeneration in both humans and in transgenic models. A decrease in diffusion anisotropy has been shown to occur in human after 20 years of age 26. Unlike in humans, growth plate closure is longdelayed in rodents 27. Studies from 28 suggest that the time window for head-brain developmentgrowth in double transgenic mice is altered, compared with normal mice. An unusual diffusion anisotropy increase, relative to the agematched controls observed in this study, may be due to the abnormal brain development in APPPS1 mice.\nFA is influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, myelination, axon diameter, axon density, and ultrastructure 29,30. The more pleomorphic histopathological changes in APPPS1 mice, which were confirmed in this study by both optic and electron microscopic observation, might affect the differences in DTI measurements. Namely, the mixture of multiple pathological changes, such as the robust amyloid and neuritic plaque deposition, glial hypertrophy, amyloid angiopathy with perivascular space dilatation, and swollen neuronal processes, could have affected the DTI-derived measurements in APPPS1 mice. The pathology results used for explanatory analysis in this study are in agreement with previous studies 313233. To date, little is known about the relationship between diffusion measurements and histopathology in the neocortex. Although several studies about the developmental changes in the neocortex have assumed that the higher DA and FA were related to less-developed neuropils 34, the interpretation of the increased DA in APPPS1 mice is not straightforward and requires further studies. Therefore, it is likely unwise to interpret the diffusion changes as direct assays for the amyloid hypothesis in AD or for the toxicity of extracellular amyloid 35.\nFindings in the gray matter structures other than the neocortex and hippocampus For the gray matter structures other than the neocortex and hippocampus, there were structures with relatively low FA (0.25), such as the amygdala and the piriform cortex, and structures with higher FA (0.25). The increase in the FA, caused by an increase in the DA with a stable DR, was identified in the structures with higher FA, such as the caudate-putamen, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the claustrum. In most studies to date, DTI has been used to assess WM integrity; however, DTI-derived parameters can also be used to reliably quantify fiber-rich GM regions, such as the thalamus 36,37, the amygdala 38,39, and the hippocampus 39,40. Our study also demonstrated significant changes in fiber-rich GM areas, such as the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the caudate-putamen. Whole-brain DTI analysis (including both GM and WM) has also been applied in several human studies 41,42 and animal studies 43.\nIt has been shown that aged APP23 mice had robust compact Aβ plaques in the neocortex, but only little and diffuse amyloid in the caudate-putamen, as well as prominent astrocytosis in the neocortex with virtually no gliosis seen in the caudate-putamen 33,44. Both the nature of amyloid plaques and the amount of plaquesgliosis alter the diffusivity in brain tissues. In addition, the diffusion changes were not always consistent, even across one anatomical structure. For example, the damage in the neocortex was highly concentrated in the dorsal-lateral portions, as demonstrated by VBA in this study. According to 33, the ventro-lateral part of the neocortex develops more diffuse amyloid compared with the dorsal-lateral parts of the neocortex. The more compressed nature of amyloid in the dorsal-lateral portions of the neocortex could explain the more significant diffusivity changes in DTI measurements relative to other portions of the neocortex. In our study, VBA also detected location-specific alterations limited to the anteromedial portions of the hippocampus. However, ABA could not detect these changes. Theoretically, VBA is much more sensitive for detecting changes limited to a small portion of an anatomical structure, while ABA is much more sensitive for the detection of small changes that are widely distributed to anatomical structures 4,7. By averaging the DTI-related measurements in an anatomical structure, ABA diluted the statistical effect if the pathological changes were localized to small portions of the structure. The larger the extent of VBA changes in an anatomical structure, the more ABA changes are likely to occur. Thus, our speculation is that the significant pathological changes in AD are primarily located in the anteromedial portion of the hippocampus. This portion corresponds to the cornu ammonis (CA) subfield of the hippocampus. Hippocampus subfields have been demonstrated to differ morphologically and functionally both in humans and in animals 454647, supporting the observation from our study that the diffusivity differed between CA subfields and the dentate gyrus.\nThe relatively faster decline in the volume of the thalamus observed by 32 could explain the significant thalamus volume loss without a significant volume reduction in other structures identified in this study. Whole-brain tissue shrinkage, along with structure-specific atrophy, was observed in our study and in studies from 28. In contrast to our findings, an enlargement of TASTPM brain with the Swedish (K670N; M671L) double familial mutation (Thy-1-APP695Sw, Line 10 (TAS10)) and the PS1 (M146V) mutation (Thy-1-PS-1M146V) was also reported, reflecting the presence of abundant amyloid deposition and astrogliosis 32. Because the mice in our study were too weak to bear lengthy anesthesia and immobilization in an MR scanner, we reduced the scan time by excluding the nose bud and the cerebellum from the FOV. Perhaps this is the reason there was no difference in brain volume between AD and WT mice. Since several studies have demonstrated that the severity of brain atrophy in AD was not correlated with the extent of amyloidosis 28,48, or with the microstructure changes 49, the exact pathologic events leading to morphological alterations remain to be further investigated.",

    "Findings in the white matter": {
      "text": "The mild FA increases caused by the prominent increase in the DA, accompanied by the mild increase in the DR and trace, were identified in the CCEC and the cingulum, and the prominent FA increases caused by the tendency toward an increase in the DA with a stable DR were seen in the internal capsule, the fimbria, and the optic tract. The past DTI findings in a mouse model of AD-with a milder ADlike phenotype-are controversial, depending on the genotype (APPsw or PDAPP mice) and the conditions (in vivo or ex vivo). The DTI findings in these other studies showed a reduced FA caused by a reduced DA, with an increased or unchanged DR (in vivo APPsw mice) 6, an unchanged DA with increased DR (in vivo PDAPP mice) 5, or an unchanged DA and DR (ex vivo APPsw mice) 50. Comparisons with human studies revealed a significant increase in the mean diffusivity and DR in the fornix, the cingulum, the internal capsule, and the corpus callosum, in line with our study, but with a decline of FA in contrast to our study 23,515253545556.\nAlthough little is known about the role of DA and DR in the gray matter areas, reduced DA has been found in the white matter areas in many types of axonal injuries, and increased DR is known to be a sensitive index by which to evaluate pathological changes in myelin 575859. Increases in both DA and DR are thought to be related to chronic ischemia 60,61. While it has been demonstrated that neuronal degeneration usually leads to decreased DA and increased DR in WM fibers 23,57,58, vascular mechanisms have an opposite effect on DA (increased DA). Since a dilated perivascular space was identified in our study and studies from 62, it is tempting to speculate that vascular pathology may have played a major role in the alterations in DA, rather than secondary degeneration. Evidence that sporadic AD is primarily a vascular rather than a neurodegenerative disorder has been reviewed in 63.\nComparisons between in vivo and ex vivo studies are a very important future direction. In this study, whole-brain DTI analysis was employed in living APPPS1 mice that could not withstand long-time stabilization in an MR scanner. To maintain the in vivo status during the MR scan was an important issue in this study because stereological analyses carried out in fixed brains may fail to detect any in vivo changes that result from cerebral fluid shifts due to amyloidosis and gliosis 64. In our study, histopathological observation could not identify obvious changes in the white matter areas in APPPS1 mice, relative to WT mice. Further quantitative histopathological studies are required to investigate whether DTI measurements are truly sensitive for the detection of subtle white matter alterations that are difficult to identify by qualitative microscopic observation, as well as to investigate the effects of the genotype, conditions, and scan parameters on diffusivity measurements.",

However, the diffusivity damage to these areas has been rarely reported in AD models, along with the claustrum and piriform cortex alterations. It has been reported that there are some tracts connecting the claustrum to the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the striatum 68,69, and the pathological changes in the claustrum are related to the cognitive dysfunction in AD 70. Alterations in the piriform cortex were also demonstrated in our study, the impairment of which is usually an early pathology of AD 71.\nCingulum disruptions in AD patients have also been reported 53,54. In AD patients, the definition of the fornix usually refers to the body of the fornix 55.

The lower resolution of the in vivo image (117117600 μm 3 ), compared to the commonly obtained ex vivo scans (approximately 120120120 μm 3 ), as well as the thicker slice used in our study (0.6 mm) compared with past in vivo studies (0.12-0.5 mm), might have increased the partial volume effects. It is well known that scan resolution affects the result of diffusion measurements 72. In addition, there were only nine mice in each group. Therefore, the results of this study might be interpreted as preliminary findings.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated the feasibility of applying whole-brain analysis methods for the evaluation of a mouse model of AD to detect pathology that extends throughout the brain. Two types of whole-brain analysis methods, VBA and ABA, worked in a complementary fashion to localize and quantify the anatomical abnormalities in the gray matter and white matter structures. Further quantitative histopathological studies are required to investigate the sensitivity of DTI for the detection of subtle white matter alterations, as well as for the investigation of the effects that genotype, conditions, and scan parameters might have on diffusivity measurements.",

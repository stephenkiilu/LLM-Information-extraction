    "abstract": "Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the common cause of cognitive decline in the old population. MRI can be used to clarify its mechanisms. However, the surrogate markers of MRI for early cognitive impairment in SVD remain uncertain to date. We investigated the cognitive impacts of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and brain volumetric measurements in a cohort of post-stroke non-dementia SVD patients. Methods: Fifty five non-dementia SVD patients were consecutively recruited and categorized into two groups as no cognitive impairment (NCI) (n  23) or vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) (n  32). Detailed neuropsychological assessment and multimodal MRI were completed. Results: The two groups differed significantly on Z scores of all cognitive domains (all p  0.01) except for the language. There were more patients with hypertension (p  0.038) or depression (p  0.019) in the VaMCI than those in the NCI group. Multiple regression analysis of cognition showed periventricular mean diffusivity (MD) (β  -0.457, p  0.01) and deep CMBs numbers (β  -0.352, p  0.01) as the predictors of attentionexecutive function, which explained 45.2 of the total variance. Periventricular MD was the independent predictor for either memory (β  -0.314, p  0.05) or visuo-spatial function (β  -0.375, p  0.01); however, only small proportion of variance could be accounted for (9.8 and 12.4, respectively). Language was not found to be correlated with any of the MRI parameters. No correlation was found between brain atrophic indices and any of the cognitive measures. Conclusion: Arteriosclerotic CMBs and periventricular white matter disintegrity seem to be independent MRI surrogated markers in the early stage of cognitive impairment in SVD.",

Email: clare1475hotmail.com adopted as the markers of SVD. These parenchyma lesions include both lacunar infarcts and white matter (WM) lesions (WMLs). Recently, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are also part of the SVD lesions, as referred in Neuroimaging standards for research into SVD and its contribution to ageing and neurodegeneration published in Lancet Neurology 2013 (Wardlaw, et al., 2013). SVD is a common cause of cognitive decline and stroke in the elderly (Pantoni, 2010). Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide more information to reveal underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment in SVD, especially at the early stage. Particularly, we try to shed light on whether CMB is an independent surrogate marker of cognitive dysfunction in SVD.\nLacunar infarcts and WMLs have been demonstrated to associate with cognitive dysfunction in various clinical settings, from cross-sectional to longitudinal, and from hospital-based to community population (Pantoni, 2010). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a direct MRI measurement of WM integrity, is found to be a more sensitive technique for detecting the cognitive impairment compared with the traditional ones (lacunes as well as WMLs on MRI) in SVD, especially at the early stage (Xu et al., 2010). CMBs are increasingly recognized as another common manifestation of SVD, and its cognitive significance has brought much attention. CMBs might be an additional risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Initial study investigated the cognitive significance of CMBs in a group of stroke patients. The presence of CMBs was the only independent predictor of executive dysfunction. By the way, CMBs were predominantly located in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia in those individuals with impaired executive function in that study (Werring et al., 2004). However, such researches on SVD patients are not only few but also with discordant results yet (van Norden et al., 2011;Gregoire et al., 2013;Lawrence et al., 2013;Patel et al., 2013).\nIn this study, we investigated cognitive significance of parenchyma lesions in a cohort of poststroke non-dementia SVD patients, by using the most sensitive MRI measurement of CMBs to date -Enhanced T2  -weighted angiography (ESWAN) three-dimensional gradient recalled echo (3D-GRE) sequence, along with the DTI for direct assessment of WM connectivity and volumetric MRI measurements of the brain.",

      "text": "Consecutive SVD patients were recruited from the stroke clinic at the Department of Neurology, RenJi Hospital, which is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, between May 2013 and July 2014. Those are lacunar stroke syndrome patients with evidence of an anatomically responsible lacunar infarct on MRI, as well as confluent leukoaraiosis (Fazekas grade 2 or more) on MRI (Fazekas et al., 1987). The patients had experienced a clinical lacunar stroke at least three months prior to recruitment. The average time from stroke to research MRI is 105.6 days (from 92 to 128 days, with standard deviation of 10.7 days). All participants were examined physically and neuropsychiatrically after the recruitment. All patients underwent laboratory examinations to exclude systemic or other neurological diseases. Patients with the following diseases or conditions were excluded: cardioembolic source or large vessel disease (50 stenosis in extra-or intra-cerebral arteries), severe systemic diseases or other diseases that may cause cognitive dysfunction (such as uncontrolled B12 deficiency or thyroid disease), cortical andor cortico-subcortical non-lacunar infarct, WMLs of other specific causes, other major central neurological system disorders, and major psychiatric disorders (except depression). In addition, patients with less than six years of education, yet meeting the criteria of dementia, (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) were excluded. Those with severe claustrophobia or contraindications to MRI examination (e.g. pacemakers, metallic implants) were also excluded. A total of 91 SVD patients were screened, among which 73 volunteered to participate. Among the participants, five patients could not complete MRI, two patients were found with MRI protocol deviation, five patients did not finish the psychological testing, and six patients withdrew their consents afterwards. As a result, a total of 55 patients were recruited and completed the protocol. These patients were further divided into two groups based on their cognitive status, i.e. no cognitive impairment (NCI) (n  23), vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) (n  32). The research ethics committee of RenJi hospital affiliated to school of medicine of Shanghai Jiao Tong University approved the study protocol, and written informed consent was given by every subject.",

      "text": "D t i a n a lysi s All diffusion parameters for the identified regions of the brain were initiated from a user-defined seed region of interest (ROI). The placement of the ROIs was chosen according to the structure that we investigated and guided by the knowledge coming from the previous studies (Huynh et al., 2008), by a trained neuroradiologist (X.C.). Briefly, equalsized ROIs (3  3 pixels) were placed in prespecified periventricular and central semiovale locations in every patient. The WM between the ventricle and the overlying cortex was bisected by an imaginary line. The half closer to the ventricle was defined as the periventricular region, the half lateral to the imaginary line was defined as the central semiovale region. The slice including the anterior horns and the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles was chosen based on those regions where WM changes were most frequently seen on T2 FLAIR image. A total of eight periventricular ROIs were placed around the lateral ventricles: four surrounding the frontal horns and four surrounding the posterior horns. Eight central semiovale ROIs were then placed within the adjacent WM lateral to the imaginary line on the same slice. ROI placements were located on T2 FLAIR lesions, further verified by the experienced neuroradiologist (Y.Z.) to ensure that no CSF or grey matter (GM) structures were included. To minimize partial volume effects, we placed ROIs at least 2 mm from tissue boundaries. Images were realigned to remove eddy current distortions. The placement of ROIs was shown in Figure 1, and the relevant stroke lesions (if existed) were avoided when we made the selection. Then, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the ROIs were studied using the tract statistics function of DTI Studio (Processing Tools and Environment for DTI, ver. 2; H. Jiang and S. Mori), which allows a statistical evaluation of the diffusion parameters of the ROIs. Finally, a further quantitative analysis (FA, MD) of the identified ROIs was performed.\nNext, the FA and MD values of periventricular as well as central semiovale were generated by averaging the measurements of eight respective ROIs. Finally, subcortical FA and MD values were computed by averaging the values of periventricular and central semiovale.\nTest-retest reliability was rated in 15 random samples, which yielded an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.773 for periventricular FA, 0.727 for central semiovale FA, 0.738 for periventricular MD, and 0.837 for central semiovale MD.\nA s s e s s m e n t of b r a i n at rophy In-house software based on a homemade program of Matlab was then used to calculate the total voxels of the intracranial volume (ICV).\nT1-weighted structural images were segmented into tissue probability maps for GM, WM and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) components using the segment function of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package (version 8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; http: www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspm). The volume of the GM and WM were calculated by the Matlab. The parenchyma volume is the total volume of GM and WM. ICV was used for normalizing the volume of GM, WM, and parenchyma.\nA s s e s s m e n t of CMBs We used the ESWAN processing toolbox available with Functool software version 9.4.05a (GE workstation Advantage Windows 4.4).\nCMBs were defined as rounded, hypointense homogeneous foci of up to 10 mm in size on ESWAN sequences. Lesions in sulci probably representing flow voids from vessels and lesions in the globus pallidus, supposedly representing iron or calcium deposits, were not considered. Choroid plexus and pineal calcifications were not considered either, as these were lesions suggestive of partial-volume effects. We adopted the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale (Gregoire et al., 2009) for the measurement of CMBs. The assessment of CMBs was performed according to their anatomic location (lobar or non-lobar). Lobar CMBs were allocated to one of five lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and insular. CMBs in the basal ganglia, thalamus, internalexternal capsule, corpus callosum, and deep and periventricular WM were scored as deep CMBs. CMBs in the brainstem and cerebellum were scored as infratentorial CMBs. The CMBs with the location of deep or infratentorial were defined as non-lobar CMBs. CMBs were rated by two trained raters (X.C and Y.W), in 15 random samples; intra-and inter-rater reliability yielded an ICC of 0.872 and 0.885 for total number of CMBs, 0.775 and 0.957 for lobar CMBs, 0.755 and 0.941 for infratentorial CMBs, and 0.870 and 0.813 for deep CMBs.",

Functional status was assessed by administering the Katz basic activities of daily living (ADL) and Lawton and Brody instrumental ADL scales to the patients primary caregivers. These scales included six basic items and eight instrumental items. Four levels of grading of ADLs were adopted (1  independent; 2  need for supervision; 3  need for help, and 4  unable) for assessment. The total scores ranged from 14 to 56. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (17 items). Depression was defined as HDRS7.\nA cognitive diagnosis was assigned to each subject according to certain criteria. A diagnosis of NCI was made if a patients scores for all neuropsychological tests were within the normal range. A diagnosis of VaMCI was based on the following: (1) basically normal ADL or impaired ADL that could not be attributed to cognitive disability, (2) failure to meet the criteria for dementia, and (3) mild quantifiable cognitive impairment within one or more domains (i.e. attention-executive function, memory, language, visuo-spatial function).The norms used were based on mean scores of each measurement from a sample of typical, elderly community members in Shanghai, China (Guo et al., 2007). We defined cognitive impairment as a score of 1.5 standard deviations below the mean on any neuropsychological test. Because some of the patients had a degree of disability due to stroke, we carefully determined which part of the disability was cognitive and which was due to the motor sequelae. Taking transportation as an example, if the subject is mobile outside of the home with only physical help (a walker, a wheelchair, or even a hand by a caregiver), heshe is cognitively independent; if the subject still needs help for orientation, heshe is rated as cognitively disabled. These determinations were based on patient history and clinical judgment, i.e. the degree of disability present at the onset of the cognitive impairment or the synchronicity of the cognitive impairment progression with the disability progression. In cases in which disability started at the time of appearance of cognitive impairment -and worsened synchronically with deterioration of cognition -it was determined that the disability was causally related to the cognitive impairment, and thus the patient could not be diagnosed as a case of VaMCI. The detailed protocol has been presented in our previous study (Xu et al., 2010).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "A typical phenotype cohort of SVD patients were recruited in this study. Only non-dementia SVD individuals were recruited and we did not include normal subjects as the control group. Instead, we compared the clinical aspects between two groups of SVD patients with different cognitive status. VCI associated with SVD is thought to be a progressive condition from normal cognitive status to frank dementia (Pantoni et al., 2009), and the primary purpose of this study is to investigate the surrogate markers of early development of VCI in SVD subjects. A wide range of possible MRI substrates of cognition were considered: the numbers of CMBs in different cerebral locations, the DTI measurements of the WM, the volume of the parenchyma as well as segmentation to WM and GM. We did not include traditional MRI ischemic markers (such as lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis) because DTI is thought to be a more direct and sensitive MRI measurements of WM (Xu et al., 2010). A characteristic cognitive profile was seen in this cohort. Multiple domains of cognition (except for the language) were affected in early stage of VCI, particularly the attentionexecutive function. Hypertension and depression were detected more often in cognitive impaired patients. The predictors of the main cognitive domains were analyzed, respectively. Demographic (age, gender and education), significant VRF (hypertension), and depressive state were included as clinical confounders. It was found that deep CMBs counts and periventricular WM MD are the two independent predictors of attention-executive function in non-dementia SVD patients.\nCMBs manifest as small, focal, homogeneous lesions on MRI sequences such as T2  -weighted GRE and T2  -weighted angiography (SWAN). There are two main types of CMBs vascular pathology: arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Pantoni, 2010). Evidence from clinicopathological and epidemiological studies indicated that different distribution patterns of CMBs may denote the underlying etiology. Lobar CMBs have been attributed to CAA, which is also known as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) (Pettersen et al., 2008), whereas CMBs located in the deepinfratentorial regions (with or without lobar CMBS) have been associated with hypertensive microangiopathy (Poels et al., 2010). As both entities are associated with age, they frequently coexisted in elderly individuals. In our study, a group of strictly defined SVD patients was recruited, among which 80 had a history of hypertension. CMBs were detected in more than 60 of the participants. All of them may be attributed to arteriolosclerosis, with pure (1135) or mixed (2435) etiology as judged by their distribution patterns.\nAlthough CMBs is one of the MRI markers for SVD (Pantoni, 2010), it has yet to be clarified whether or not CMBs can be regarded as an independent and direct substrate for cognitive impairment, which can be denoted by the correlation of the CMBs locations with the specific cognitive domains. Histopathologic studies have shown that CMBs may have a direct effect on surrounding or connected brain regions. This is supported by recorded tissue necrosis. However, other studies indicated that CMBs may be just the marker of co-existed SVD or degenerative lesions instead of the causal factor itself (Werring et al., 2010). Previously, Gregorie suggested an indirect link between CMBs and cognitive impairment (Gregoire et al., 2013) because executive impairment was associated with strictly lobar (parieto-occipital lobes and insula, but not deep) CMBs in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. In another study, Van Norden found that CMBs were related to the cognition of multiple domains in non-dementia SVD patients (van Norden et al., 2011), and the relationship was mainly driven by lobar CMBs, but by deep located CMBs to a lesser extent. In Gregories study, only 35.9 (115320) of the subjects are etiologically due to small-artery occlusion, whereas the Van Nordens study only recruited participants with mild SVD lesions. The MRI inclusion criteria are the presence of lacunar infarcts andor WML. And 34.2 of the subjects had lacunar infarcts detected on MRI, and the median WML volume was only 7.1 ml per person in the latter study. However, in Patel et al. (2013) and this study, well-defined phenotype SVD patients were included by comparable MRI criteria. Whole brain CMBs counts was weakly associated with executive dysfunction and worked in a mode in Patels study, with the association driven by subjects with high CMBs counts, whereas a distinct linear correlation between deep CMBs counts and the attention-executive function was found in our cohort. Both studies have controlled for DTI parameters, which are better markers of WM damage. It has been suggested that the effect of CMBs may be masked by the advanced coexisting pathologic lesions damaging the cognitive network in Patels studies (Patel et al., 2013), which dementia patients may also include in, thus creates a threshold effect of CMBs. In another study, Seo et al. (2007) recruited a cohort of SVD dementia patients, and it was found that CMBs were most commonly distributed in the cortex, as well as that the number of CMBs was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in multiple domains. This added the evidence that the mixed and advanced pathologies are common in SVD, especially in the late stage. In contrast, the exclusion of dementia patients may allow us to include patients with less co-existing pathology. In addition, more patients were detected with CMBs presence in our study (63.6) compared to Patels (39.7). From these studies, we can infer that in the sporadic SVD population at various stages in a progressive course, CMBs cause cognitive dysfunction in a complex interplay pattern with coexisting vascular or degenerative lesions. For this reason, the relationship between cognition and CMBs was found to be discordant. Recently, the total MRI load (lacunes, leukoaraiosis, CMBs, and perivascular spaces) of SVD was measured by Staals using the semi-volumetric scale in healthy old participants (Staals et al., 2015). It was found that the total MRI load score was associated with general cognitive state but not with executive processing speed, whereas an association was present between WM hyperintensities (WMH) (Fazekas score) separately and processing speed (results not shown). It suggested a more heavy reliance of executive ability on WMLs, and different SVD features may disrupt brain tissue and cognitive pathways in different extents. However, the distinct correlation between executive function with deep subcortical CMBs was demonstrated in this study, even controlled for WM DTI parameters. This may be attributable not only to the population settings but also to the investigating method. It should be mentioned that the ESWAN technique we adopted may improve the detection of CMBs, compared with T2  -weighted imaging in the previous studies (Guo et al., 2013). If CMBs are part of the same spectrum of disease, this may be way forward, as many of these will not only affect microarchitecture of subcortical WM, but also by other mechanisms independently.\nIn this study, another independent predictor for executive function was periventricular WM diffusivity, which is a more sensitive index than deep CMBs counts. This finding is consistent with the previous studies (Xu et al., 2010). It added more evidence that WM tract damage results in a dysexecutive syndrome owing to disruption of cortical-subcortical and cortical-cortical connections in SVD (Tekin and Cummings, 2002). As found in other studies, the associations with the cognition were stronger and more consistent for diffusivity than for FA (Lawrence et al., 2013). Furthermore, periventricular diffusivity appears to be the independent predictor for memory or visuospatial function, although to a lesser extent. It has been suggested that the executive and memory dysfunctions in SVD patients were independently caused by the disruption of WM integrity (Xu et al., 2010;van der Holst et al., 2013). Recently, default mode network analysis suggested that abnormal EEG activity in the mapping of parieto-occipital, fronto-parieto-occipital may reflect early executive and visuo-spatial dysfunction in SVD (Sheorajpanday et al., 2013). Hence, it is reasonable to deduce that disruption of WM integrity, which causes the cerebral network disconnection, may contribute to the multiple domains of cognitive impairment in SVD. Another finding is that the cognitive function was associated with periventricular rather than centrum semiovale MD. It has been suggested that this may related to the fact that the periventricular area has a high density of long associating fibers, which connect the cortex with subcortical nuclei and other distant brain territories, whereas centrum semiovale contains more short associating fibers that link adjacent gyri (De Groot et al., 2002). In this study, language is not related to the integrity of subcortical structures and showed no difference between different cognitive states in this study, as found in previous studies (Votaw et al., 1999).The location of damage may be important for understanding of mechanisms in SVD (Smith et al., 2010). Therefore, we adopted ROI rather than a whole brain measurement because it may help us focus on the primarily injured WM regions in SVD, especially in the early stage.\nFor cerebral atrophic measurements, only GM volume was found lower in cognitively impaired subjects. Brain parenchyma volume, WM, or GM volume was not related to cognition in SVD. Atrophy has been suggested as an important measure to assess the burden of vascular damage in the brain in imaging studies (Aribisala et al., 2013). Recently, in a large cohort of community aged population, Ritchie et al. (2015) found that total grey and normal appearing WM volumes correlated positively with all cognitive factors, whereas a negative correlation was found for WMH. In our study, none of the global atrophy measurements was observed to be the early cognitive surrogate marker in SVD. Previous SVD study reported that hippocampal volume was most effective in differentiating normal and cognitively impaired cases, whereas GM volume was a more important determinant of impaired versus demented (Mungas et al., 2001). However, we did not investigate the focal atrophic parameters, such as hippocampal volume in this study.\nSeveral limitations are worth of mention. First, the sample size is small and majority of our subjects are male, thus the findings of this study might not be generalized to the whole population. Second, we did not adjust for the presence of concomitant AD pathology in this study. Therefore, we cannot elucidate the complex interplay mechanism of cognitive impairment between vascular and degenerative lesions in SVD. Third, because it was a cross-sectional study, we are unable to conclude that deep CMBs and subcortical WM diffusivity predict cognitive impairment through a continuum of VCI progression in SVD patients. Fourth, the regression method may introduce bias into this small sample. Hence, longitudinal studies with larger sample, which account for both vascular and neurodegenerative pathological changes in patients, are needed for further investigation into the underlying mechanism of cognitive impairment in SVD.",

      "text": "In this study, deep CMBs numbers were found to be correlated with the attention-executive dysfunction independently in non-dementia SVD patients. Such anatomic correlation between the distribution of CMBs and the affected cognitive domains may suggest a potential detrimental mechanism of CMBs. The periventricular WM diffusivity seems to be responsible for a broad spectrum of cognitive impairment, particularly the attention-executive function. Our findings indicate that arteriosclerotic CMBs possibly cause disruption of subcortical neural networks relevant to attention-executive function itself, which is superimposed on the effects of co-existed lesions in the early stage of VCI in SVD. Therefore, CMBs may be regarded as one of the independent surrogate cognitive markers in SVD patients.",

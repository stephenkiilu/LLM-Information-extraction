    "abstract": "Increased iron in subcortical gray matter (GM) structures of patients with Huntingtons disease (HD) has been suggested as a causal factor in neuronal degeneration. But how iron content is related to white matter (WM) changes in HD is still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether WM changes share the same physiopathology (i.e. iron accumulation) with GM or whether there is a different mechanism. The present study used MRI to examine iron content in premanifest gene carriers (PreHD, n 5 25) and in early HD patients (n 5 25) compared with healthy controls (n 5 50). 3T MRI acquisitions included high resolution 3D T1, EPI sequences for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an indirect measure of tissue integrity, and T2-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging for MR-based relaxometry (R2), which provides an indirect measure of ferritiniron deposition in the brain. Myelin breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, but there is no difference in iron content values. Iron content reduction manifests later, in the early HD stage, in which we found a lower R2 parameter value in the isthmus. The WM iron reduction in HD is temporally well-defined (no iron differences in PreHD subjects and iron differences only in early HD patients). Iron level in callosal WM may be regarded as a marker of disease state, as iron does not differentiate PreHD subjects from controls but distinguishes between PreHD and HD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Iron is a biometal that has a fundamental role in numerous brain metabolic processes, thus it is considered essential for life Salvador et al., 2011. In normal conditions, iron concentrations in various regions of the brain vary greatly. In general, regions of the brain associated with motor functions (extrapyramidal regions) tend to have more iron than non-motor-related regions Koeppen, 1995; and white matter (WM) stains more strongly for iron than gray matter (GM) LeVine and Macklin, 1990. Furthermore, the amount of iron in the brain is is not stable from birth; in fact, it accumulates progressively during brain development Zecca et al., 2004 and increases until age 40 Thomas and Jankovic, 2004.\nDysregulation of non-heme iron (ferritin transferring ionic iron) metabolism and its accumulation in various parts of the brain is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases Moos and Morgan, 2004;Zecca et al., 2004. Indeed, the presence of higher iron concentrations in subcortical GM structures potentiates reactive oxygen species and consequently contributes to increasing the oxidative stress implicated in neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntingtons disease (HD) Bartzokis et al., 1999;Hilditch-Maguire et al., 2000.\nHow iron content relates to WM changes in HD is still not completely known. It is unclear whether WM changes share the same physiopathology with GM or whether a separate primary pathologymechanism can explain the WM modifications.\nDifferent from GM, where a variety of cell bodies (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) and processes (axons, dendrites, and myelin) coexist, WM fibers are composed primarily of myelin and axons. Thus, investigating WM allows us to study the process of HD pathogenesis from another prospective (which seems structurally simpler) and to determine how the HD demyelination hypothesis Bartzokis et al., 2007 applies to WM tissue.\nAccording to the HD demyelination hypothesis, early and heavily myelinated fibers are those most susceptible to myelin breakdown Bartzokis et al., 2007. In fact, the breakdown of these fibers is associated with increased density of the oligodendrocytes in the brain, which are involved in repairing the myelin damage. As the oligodendrocytes have the highest iron (ferritin and trasnferrin) content Bartzokis et al., 2007, when they increase iron content also increases. The consequent iron accumulation is hypothesized to cause further damage (such as oxidative stress) Beal, 1996. In this study, we aimed to determine how iron content is linked to WM breakdown in HD.\nIron content can be indirectly measured in vivo with transverse relaxation rate (R2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures (MR-based relaxometry), known as R2 maps (defined as 1T2 x 1000). R2 is an MRI measure sensitive to tissue changes (such as changes in iron) and has been shown to be sensitive to ironferritin deposits in the brain Cherubini et al., 2009;Peran et al., 2009. R2 is not, however, a specific measure of iron; in fact, many other tissue changes, including myelination, calcification, blood flow, and increased tissue water, can influence this measure. To overcome this problem, we used a multimodal MRI approach, combining different MRI acquisitions to differentiate the effects of the main variables (water vs. iron) that can modify R2.\nTo date, only two in vivo MRI studies on HD Bartzokis et al., 2007;Bartzokis and Tishler, 2000 have investigated callosal WM iron content in HD. Both report iron level reduction in frontal WM and in the anterior subregion of the corpus callosum (CC).\nIn a previous study on macro-and micro-structural callosal modifications in HD Di Paola et al., 2012, we detected CC volume reduction (macrostructural level) starting in the isthmus; at microstructural level the change was characterized by early WM demyelination accompanied by axonal damage.\nIn this study, we aimed to continue this line of research Di Paola et al., 2012. Specifically, we set out to investigate the physiopathological mechanisms underlying WM callosal changes in a sample of HD patients. We wished to determine whether the macro-and microstructural callosal WM changes found in HD are related to modifications in R2 and whether CC R2 is a possible marker of the disease state by comparing premanifest gene carriers (PreHD) with healthy subjects (HC) and patients in the early stages of HD (i.e., I and II). For this purpose, we combined two well-validated macro-and micro-structural analysis techniques: voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to map callosal WM density and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate microstructural differences in callosal WM. We also used a relatively new MRI technique, namely, voxel-based relaxometry (VBR). This is a morphometric method that analyzes R2 maps on a voxel-by-voxel basis, with no a priori selected region of interest.",

      "text": "Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are presented in Table I. All HD subjects (n 5 50) underwent a genetic test (abnormal CAG repeats 36) and were examined clinically by the same neurologist with expertise in HD. Twenty-five PreHD subjects and 25 HD patients in the early disease stages (I and II) were enrolled in the study. All individuals were assessed using the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), which includes motor, cognitive, behavioral, and functional subscales Huntington et al., 1996. Each section consists of a multistep subscale. The motor section measures eye movements, limb coordination, tongue impersistence and movement disorders (such as rigidity, bradykenisia, dystonia, chorea, and gait disturbances). The cognitive scale mainly evaluates executive function. The behavioral section investigates the presence of depression, aggressiveness, obsessionscompulsions, delusionshallucinations and apathy. The functional assessments include the HD functional capacity scale (HDFCS), the independence scale and a checklist of common daily tasks. All three scales mainly investigate independence in daily life activities. The HDFCS is reported as the total functional capacity (TFC) score (range 0-13) and is the only functional subscale with established psychometric properties (including inter-rater reliability and validity), which are based on radiographic measures of disease progression. Thus, the TFC score is used worldwide to determine patients HD stage. On the independence scale, the investigator indicates whether the patient can perform the task that evaluates independence level (range 10-100). The checklist (functional assessment) is summed by giving a score of 1 to all yes answers (range 0-25). Pre-HD subjects included asymptomatic ones (total motor score 5 on the UHDRS) Paulsen et al., 2001. The Disease Burden index, a measure of disease severity, was used according to the already described formula (age 3 CAG-35.5), where CAG is the number of CAG repeats Penney et al., 1997. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Folstein et al., 1975, which measures global cognitive functioning, was administered to PreHD subjects and HD patients. Patients in the advanced stages of disease (Stages III and IV) andor with traumatic brain injury or MRI focal lesions were excluded.\nWe recruited 50 HC from the community. They were individually age-and sex-matched with the PreHD subjects and HD patients. Consent was obtained from all participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Santa Lucia Foundation Research Ethics Committee.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Iron is an essential biometal that is vital in cell functions Salvador et al., 2011. During development, it accumulates progressively in the brain Zecca et al., 2004. In normal conditions, oligodendrocytes are the principal cells in the central nervous system that stain for iron. Both human and animal studies Todorich et al., 2009 have shown that chronic severe iron deficiency leads to hypomyelination. This finding supports the role of this biometal in myelin production.\nThe demyelination hypothesis Bartzokis et al., 2007 suggests that the breakdown of early and heavily myelinated fibers is associated with increased density of oligodendrocytes attempting to repair myelin damage. As the oligodendrocytes have the highest iron content of all brain cell types Bartzokis et al., 2007, an increase in their number causes an increase in iron. This iron accumulation is hypothesized to cause further damage (such as oxidative stress) Beal, 1996. Indeed, the dysregulation of iron metabolism and accumulation in various parts of the brain is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including HD Moos and Morgan, 2004;Zecca et al., 2004. This mechanism is well known in HD subcortical GM structures, where increased iron has always been reported Sanchez-Castaneda et al., 2013;Vonsattel et al., 2008. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between WM breakdown and iron, as measured by the R2 parameter.\nOur first finding was loss of R2 in the callosal WM in HD, which highlights a new aspect: the R2 in HD has a different pattern at the WM level (decreased R2) and at the GM level (increased R2).\nOne possible explanation of our results comes from animal model studies that found differences in iron accumulation in WM and GM based on different iron metabolismaccumulation in WM versus GM oligodendrocytes. Indeed, WM oligodendrocytes have been found to be equipped with additional iron efflux mechanisms to prevent intracellular iron overload, a compensatory upregulation that likely works as a fail-safe mechanism Schulz et al., 2011.\nSecond, we found that the R2 change in callosal WM in HD is temporally well-defined: myelin breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, with no R2 changes, and R2 reduction manifests only in the early HD stage. This finding can be explained by referring to Bartzokis et al.s hypothesis 2012. Specifically, the HD brain may be continually trying to remyelinate in a losing attempt to compensate for the disease-related myelin loss. In HD, these remyelination processes may successfully compensate in the early years, which usually correspond to the beginning of the pathology, or in the years prior to onset. But, eventually they start to fail in later years as brain myelin volume continues to grow and it becomes increasigly difficult to maintain this expanding volume. The critical point of the remyelination failure may vary depending on the CAG repeat length.\nThird, we suggest that as the R2 does not differentiate subjects prior to disease onset (PreHD) from controls, but distinguishes between PreHD subjects and patients in the earliest stages of HD, the callosal R2 level should be regarded as a marker of disease state.\nAlthough R2 is an MRI measure sensitive to tissue changes (such as iron changes), it is not a specific measure of iron. In fact, many other tissue changes, including myelination, calcifications, blood flow, and increased tissue water, can influence this measure. Briefly, R2 is an MRI measure of microscopic magnetic field inhomogeneity. It is increased by the paramagnetic effect of iron and the diamagnetic effect of myelin. In other words, as tissue iron and deoxyhaemoglobin are paramagnetic, when placed in an external magnetic field their magnetic moment aligns along the field, causing a slight increase in magnetic field strength and intra-voxel field inhomogeneity; thus, an increase in tissue iron, or deoxyhaemoglobin (from increased oxidative metabolism) will increase R2 Yablonskiy and Haacke, 1994. On the other side, myelin is diamagnetic; when placed in an external magnetic field its intrinsic magnetic moment aligns against the field, causing a decrease in magnetic field strength but also an increase in magnetic field inhomogeneity He and Yablonskiy, 2009. Thus myelin also increases R2 Li et al., 2012.\nIn this study, by combining different MRI acquisitions (DTI and R2) we were able to differentiate the effects of the main variables (water vs. iron) that can modify R2. Thus, we believe it is very likely that many of the R2 differences which emerged in our study were due to iron modifications.\nFrom a methodological point of view, combining different MRI acquisitions is the novelty of this study. We acquired MRI R2 parameters in conjunction with different DTI parameters (FA, MD, RD, and AD). Together, they allowed us to explore microstructural differences in the callosal WM changes of our patients and to investigate the potential role of different underlying mechanisms (demyelination vs. iron content) and factors (water vs. iron). Furthermore, different from previous studies Bartzokis et al., 2007;Bartzokis and Tishler, 2000 we did not use a priori selection of a brain region to detect iron content.\nIn agreement with previous studies Di Paola et al., 2012;Rosas et al., 2010, we found that the isthmus was the CC sub-region most affected in PreHD subjects. Our DTI analysis detected FA and RD differences only in the isthmus of PreHD subjects. Furthermore, again in agreement with the mentioned studies, we found no significant AD difference in PreHD. This suggests the occurrence of myelin damage the presymptomatic stages, not impaired axonal coherence. We found no WM density changes or iron content differences in PreHD as compared with controls. This suggests that significant WM demyelination occurs prior to iron and volumetric modifications.\nIn HD patients, the whole CC showed decreased WM density compared with controls, in agreement with the findings of previous studies Hobbs et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2010. FA, AD, and RD were also significantly different in all CC regions in HD patients compared with controls. These findings suggest that both myelin breakdown (reflected by increased RD) and axonal damage (reflected by increased AD) can affect callosal WM when HD is fully manifested. When HD patients were compared with healthy controls, we found a significantly reduced callosal R2 value mainly in the isthmus.\nComparisons between PreHD subjects and HD patients also suggest that CC changes are temporally and spatially well defined. Modifications seem to be detectable in the isthmus in PreHD subjects and proceed in a posterior-to-anterior direction, eventually involving both the isthmus and body of HD patients for all parameters investigated (i.e., callosal WM density, myelin and axonal integrity and iron content).\nResults of comparisons between PreHD subjects and HD patients confirm that the difference in the isthmus of PreHD subjects is most likely caused by specific damage to the myelin sheaths (i.e., we observed changes in RD but not AD). In later HD stages (I and II), these alterations seem to be driven by both myelin and axonal damage (i.e., in HD patients we observed changes in both RD and AD). The callosal R2 value of HD patients was lower than that of pre-HD subjects mainly in the isthmus, but also more anteriorly involving the callosal body and the rostrum and posteriorly, the splenium.\nThe finding of reduced R2 in callosal WM is in agreement with two previous studies in the literature Bartzokis et al., 2007;Bartzokis and Tishler, 2000. In both, the Authors reported a decreased iron level in the frontal lobe WM and anterior CC using the field dependent relaxation rate (FDRI) method which compares the R2 values calculated from spinecho images obtained at lower-and higher-field strengths to obtain a measure of iron in ferritin deposits. The low fieldstrength instrument R2 is highly sensitive to MR-visible water and it showed increased MR-visible water in the same WM regions. The Authors concluded that in these regions their results might have been due to decreased iron or increased MR-visible water caused by tissue damage.\nApplying what we mentioned above about the R2 changes to our results, it seems that reduced R2 may be due to tissue loss and consequently increased water and or reduced tissue iron. Although we have no other direct measures (such as phase images) to help us discriminate between the roles of iron and water, we can use the DTI parameters as indirect measures to exclude the potential confounding effects of water. In PreHD versus controls, we found early WM demyelination with no difference in R2. In the HD versus PreHD comparison, we found that demyelination at the level of the isthmus was more anteriorly associated with axonal damage. We also found reduced R2 at the level of the isthmus, with no difference in MD in the same callosal subregion. Thus, as no differences in the total amount of water in the isthmus were present (i.e., no difference in MD), we can infer that the difference we found in R2 in the isthmus was more likely due to reduced iron content.\nThus, we suggest that the reduced iron level had a main effect on our results. Of course, as the pathology progresses it is likely that both iron and water will be present and affect WM callosal changes.\nBefore drawing conclusions some limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First longitudinal studies need to be performed to investigate the evolution of the brain changes in HD over the time. Second, larger PreHD and HD samples need to be collected to better assess the influence of CAG repeats. Third a group of PreHD soft signs should be included in the future studies, to further investigate the pre-symptomatic stage of HD. The PreHD soft signs can be indeed considered as an intermediate pathology stage between the pre-symptomatic subjects (PreHD) and the symptomatic patients (HD). Four a blinded region of interest analyses should be run to confirm automated analyses findings.",

    "CONCLUSIONS": {
      "text": "In agreement with the HD demyelination hypothesis Bartzokis et al., 2007, we found the breakdown of early and heavily myelinated fibers, such as those present in the isthmus. Furthermore, in agreement with the same Authors Bartzokis et al., 2007;Bartzokis and Tishler, 2000, we found reduced iron in the callosal WM.\nThus, in HD the pattern of iron content seems to be characterized by decreased iron in WM and increased iron in subcortical GM. One possible explanation of this result comes from an animal model study. Schulz et al. 2011 reported that oligodendrocytes seem to be equipped with an additional iron efflux fail-safe mechanism.\nWhether the reduced iron content is related to a neurodegenerative process (e.g., failure to repair myelin damage Connor et al., 1990 or to a neurodevelopmental process (abnormal brain development and myelination Nopoulos et al., 2010) has still not been clarified. Perhaps a more dynamic approach, connecting both aspects (neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental), would be useful to better understand the iron mechanism. Once again, we cite the hypothesis proposed by Bartzokis Bartzokis et al., 2007, according to which the HD brain may be continually trying to remyelinate in a losing attempt to compensate for the disease-related myelin loss (neurodegenerative aspect). In HD, these remyelination processes may successfully compensate in younger years but then start to fail in older years as the brain myelin volume continues to grow and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain this expanding volume. This is similar to what happens in healthy older individuals Bartzokis et al., 2012. The early and continuous expenditure of resources to repair myelin might support these data, by suggesting some slowing in brain development (neurodevelopmental aspect).\nLongitudinal studies of juvenile forms of HD would help verify whether myelin breakdown and changes in iron levels are causal factors in HD pathogenesis and when in the course of pathology they start to act. Moreover, early intervention to reduce myelin breakdown and correct iron accumulation might make it possible to increase effectiveness of treatment, decrease the need for later more aggressive approaches, and ultimately might represent a heretofore unexplored opportunity for primary prevention of degenerative brain diseases Bartzokis, 2005;Nguyen et al., 2005;Youdim et al., 2004.",

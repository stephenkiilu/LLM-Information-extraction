    "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of the study was to construct and validate a nomogram that combines diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and clinically relevant features for predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimers disease (AD). Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the MRI and clinical data of 121 MCI patients, of whom 32 progressed to AD during a 4-year follow-up period. The MCI patients were divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. DTI features were extracted from MCI patient data in the training set, and their dimensionality was reduced to construct a radiomics signature (RS). Then, combining the RS with independent predictors of MCI disease progression, a joint model was constructed, and a nomogram was generated. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical efficacy of the nomogram based on the data from the validation set. Result: The AUCs of the RS in the training and validation sets were 0.81 and 0.84, with sensitivities of 0.87 and 0.78 and specificities of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the RS, clinical dementia rating scale score, and Alzheimers disease assessment scale score were the independent predictors of progression and were thus used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram in the training and validation sets were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, with sensitivities of 0.78 and 0.89 and specificities of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. DCA showed that the nomogram was the most valuable model for predicting the progression of MCI to AD and that it provided greater net benefits than other analysed models. Conclusion: Changes in white matter fibre bundles can serve as predictive imaging markers for MCI disease progression, and the combination of white matter DTI features and relevant clinical features can be used to construct a nomogram with important predictive value for MCI disease progression.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "As the population continues to age, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases has also shown a significant increase 1. Alzheimers disease (AD) is a common and serious geriatric disease that places massive burdens on patients and their families 2. Although there is currently no effective treatment for the condition, early diagnosis and prediction of AD progression are crucial for developing personalized treatment plans and improving patient quality of life and disease management.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common pre-AD symptom and is considered a transitional stage between normal ageing and AD 3. The cognitive ability of patients with MCI decreases over the natural course of ageing, but not to the degree seen in AD. That said, there are significant differences in pathological progression among different MCI patients. Some patients will never develop AD, while others will continue to deteriorate 4. If high-risk MCI patients can be identified and appropriate intervention measures can be taken in advance, it may help delay the progression into AD or alleviate its symptoms. In addition, for low-risk MCI patients, unnecessary medical examinations and psychological burden can be reduced or avoided, and the efficiency of medical resource use can be improved. Therefore, it is essential to develop a reliable and noninvasive method for predicting whether patients with MCI will progress to AD.\nIn recent years, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become an important part of magnetic resonance technology. It offers numerous details about the microstructure of white matter by evaluating the diffusion of water molecules along myelinated nerve fibres 5, often quantified with DTI parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). These parameters can assess the integrity and connectivity of white matter fibre tracts, providing a new perspective in the study of the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases 6. Previous studies have shown that patients with MCI may experience a decrease in the integrity of white matter fibre tracts with respect to normal elderly individuals 7, abnormalities that may be related to cognitive decline. Based on the above conclusions, DTI may have the potential to predict the progression of MCI to AD. However, axonal degeneration, demyelination, cytoskeletal disorganization, packing density, and other microstructural features can affect DTI measurements 8,9. Using DTI alone to predict the progression of MCI may result in low sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this study will also investigate the correlation between various clinical cognitive factors and DTI indicators. Additionally, it will incorporate DTI data to analyse and integrate these factors. Through this comprehensive analysis, we hypothesize that the prediction accuracy of DTI can be improved, providing a more accurate basis for personalized treatment and intervention.\nIn this study, we also constructed a nomogram model based on this comprehensive analysis to visually predict high-risk patients with MCI who will progress to AD. A nomogram is a graphical tool that is designed to approximate complicated calculation quickly and without a computer or calculator, and by graphically representing the effect of each predictor on the outcome, it gives readers a more tangible interpretation of each predictors impact on the outcome 10. In fact, neuroscientists and patients alike desire reliable prognostic information tailored to the individual patient, which creates a simple graphical representation of a statistical predictive model that generates a numerical probability of a clinical event, and the ability of nomograms to generate individualized predictions enables their use in the identification and stratification of patients for participation in clinical trials 11.\nIn summary, the goal of this study was to integrate and analyse clinical data and DTI data to explore biomarkers and risk factors related to the pathological progression of MCI. Finally, we aimed to develop a multivariate risk prediction nomogram model to forecast the progression of MCI to AD. This model will offer crucial assistance in the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of AD.",

      "text": "The object information of this study was obtained from the ADNI (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI database is a multicentre research project that studies AD and related cognitive impairment. It collects a large amount of clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data from different research institutions. Cases that met the MCI diagnostic criteria were obtained through the official website of the ADNI database. After extracting data, quality control was carried out on the obtained information. Cases with missing clinical information or image data were excluded, and 121 MCI patients were ultimately included, of whom 32 had converted to AD during a 4-year follow-up period. These patients all had complete clinical and imaging information, including sex, age, education level, family history, cognitive and disease scale scores, and related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) information. In addition, the 121 MCI patients were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set at a 7:3 ratio. The training set was used to construct a predictive model, while the validation set was used to validate the performance of the model.\nFeature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction FSL software (https:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) was used for preprocessing and analysis of DTI images. The former includes skull stripping, eddy current correction, head movement correction, and adjustment of the diffusion gradient direction. Detailed information can be found in the online supplementary material (for all online suppl. material, see https:doi.org10.1159 000534767). DTI features were extracted using a white matter fibre tract template comprising 48 fibre tracts that were mapped onto standard MNI152 space and resampled to a resolution of 1 mm. Finally, the diffusion tensor parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, were calculated for each participants individual fibre bundles. To eliminate nonrepeatable, redundant, and irrelevant features from the initial set, we used maximum correlation minimum redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods for feature dimension reduction on the DTI feature set extracted from the training set. The detailed steps are provided in the online supplementary materials.",

In this study, we referred to the identified biomarkers collectively as the radiomic signature (RS).

We calculated the difference in radscore between stable and progressive cases in both the training and validation sets.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The results of this study show that the RS based on DTI features of white matter fibre tracts has good predictive performance, effectively identifying people at high risk of MCI and indicating that white matter fibre tracts are involved in the pathological progression of the disease. Furthermore, by incorporating clinical scale scores and developing a joint model, the predictive performance was substantially enhanced. In particular, the visual nomogram generated based on the joint model can provide a noninvasive, repeatable, and easy-to-use method for clinical practice. Junior doctors can also identify high-risk patients in the early stages of MCI to develop individualized treatment plans as early as possible.\nThis study identified 8 fibre bundle features that are most related to the progression of MCI, and these findings are consistent with the white matter microstructure changes related to brain regions during the progression from MCI to AD described in a meta-analysis 12. Both the left and right hippocampal cingulate gyri are involved in the progression of MCI; previous studies have shown that the hippocampus is a key brain structure related to memory, and the connection between its cingulate gyrus and other brain regions is believed to play an important role in memory function 13. Therefore, our research results suggest that abnormalities in the striatum, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus may be related to decreased memory function during the progression of MCI to AD, and this further confirms the conclusion of Fellgiebel and Yakushev 14, who found that the diffusion coefficient of the hippocampus derived from DTI is a better predictor of the extent of situational memory impairment in early AD patients than the conventional volume index. This study also found that the uncinate fasciculus was an important feature in constructing the RS. Park et al.s 15 research results are consistent with these findings, indicating that the uncinate fasciculus is associated with memory loss in MCI. The uncinate fasciculus is a fibre bundle that connects the temporal and frontal lobes, the latter of which is associated with cognitive functions. This finding indirectly supports the significance of the frontal lobe in the progression of MCI. It also provides an explanation for the importance of the left upper longitudinal bundle in constructing the RS, and the upper longitudinal bundle is a fibre bundle that connects the prefrontal and parietal lobes of the brain 16. The remaining features, including the right cingulate tract and the left inferior cerebellar peduncle tract, further reveal the involvement of relevant brain regions, such as the cerebellum and brainstem, in the pathological progression of MCI, and these white matter fibre bundles may reveal pathological changes during the progression of MCI disease, but further research is needed to confirm this. Our study also found that the CDRS and ADAS scores, as clinical features, were also involved in the creation of nomogram. In fact, both scales can help doctors diagnose potential AD as early as possible in the MCI stage and predict future disease progression 17,18. Our research results also confirm the above conclusion. From a purely diagnostic perspective, the accuracy of the clinical model constructed by combining the scores of these two scales was similar to that of the RS. However, it should be noted that these evaluation scales may not be sensitive enough in the early stage of MCI, as patients cognitive and functional impairment may be mild at this stage and difficult to fully capture by the scales 19. This is further supported by the analysis of the clinical model, which only had a sensitivity of 0.61 in the training group. In addition, the evaluation scale provides evaluation results for specific time points, but the progression of AD is a gradual process. Therefore, a single evaluation may not fully reflect changes in the condition 20. This could be the main reason for the unstable sensitivity and specificity of clinical models.\nTract-based statistics-based DTI have shown early specific changes in patients with MCI who progress to AD 21, and this finding suggests that neuronal degeneration in AD and MCI can change the structure of white matter fibre bundles. Based on this, the study also analysed the DTIderived parameters of specific fibre bundles to identify highrisk MCI patients who may progress to AD. A diagnostic efficacy of 0.84 was achieved in the independent test group, increasing to 0.91 after incorporating clinical scales, demonstrating excellent performance. In fact, prospective DTI study has been conducted to predict the progression of MCI. Hiyoshi-Taniguchi et al. 22 used the fractional an-isotropy (FA) values of the uncinate fasciculus to predict the diagnostic efficacy of MCI conversion to AD, which is 0.813. This is similar to the prediction results of this study using DTI technology alone, which further confirms the research results of Makovac et al. 23, and they used DTI and quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters to confirm the involvement of white matter and particularly of association fibres in the progression of AD. Similar studies have used MRI and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate brain function combined with machine learning algorithms to identify MCI progression 24. The diagnostic accuracy reported by these studies was 0.95, which is higher than the results of the current study. This difference in accuracy may be due to the benefit from the role of machine learning. However, this study only used traditional logistic regression for nomogram construction, and machine learning modelling may provide more accurate results in the future. In addition, Lin et al. 25 utilized blood sample gene biomarkers to predict stable patients with MCI. The diagnostic accuracy (AUC  0.841) was similar to the diagnostic efficacy of the RS in this study. However, considering its noninvasiveness and cost-effectiveness, current study method may be more suitable for clinical screening.\nThis study also faces potential limitations and challenges. First, our research sample may have been affected by selection bias, which could limit the generalizability of the results. Second, this study focused solely on the application of DTI technology in predicting the progression from MCI to AD. The value of other imaging technologies and biomarkers still needs further exploration. Finally, long-term follow-up and large-sample multicentre studies are necessary to validate and confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Background. Biochemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reflect pathophysiological processes in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, it is still not clear how these processes correlate with grey matter (GM) volume and microstructural changes in the brain. Objective. To assess the relationship between CSF biomarkers and structural brain changes in AD. Design and setting. Cross-sectional study in a memory clinic-based sample. Subjects. A total of 78 subjects were included in the study: 22 with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 35 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 21 with AD. Main outcome measures. Voxel-wise correlations between CSF biomarkers, including b-amyloid 42 (Ab42) , tau phosphorylated at position threonine 181 and total tau protein, and GM volume, selfdiffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean dif-fusivity (MD) maps using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistical analyses. FA and MD maps were obtained using diffusion tensor imaging. Results. In the whole sample (patients with SCI, MCI and AD), there was positive correlation between GM volume and Ab42 concentration, and negative correlation with total tau protein. Higher FA was only related to higher concentration of Ab42. MD showed significant negative correlation with Ab42 and positive correlation with T-tau levels. The majority of brain regions with significant correlation with CSF biomarkers overlapped with the default mode network and extended to the adjacent white matter. Conclusions. Early AD pathological changes can be detected with voxel-based morphometric analysis and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Furthermore, there was an association between CSF AD biomarkers and structural brain changes in areas related to the default mode network.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly. Amyloid plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are pathological hallmarks of AD and contain b-amyloid 42 (Ab42) and tau phosphorylated at position threonine 181 (P-tau 181p ), respectively 1. Evidence indicates that AD is associated with a sequence of patho-physiological changes that occur decades before the onset of dementia 2.\nAb42, P-tau 181p and total tau protein (T-tau) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reflect AD pathophysiological processes 3. Decreased levels of Ab42 and increased P-tau 181P and T-tau in the CSF have been found in AD 4,5. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a transitional stage between normal cognition in the elderly and AD 6. Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) may be a pre-MCI stage and the first detectable phase in the development of AD (SCI-MCI-AD) 7. Consistent with the pathological findings, an AD profile in the CSF is also common in individuals with amnestic MCI and SCI, and levels of Ab42, T-tau and P-tau 181p in the CSF could predict the conversion to AD from MCI 8,9.\nProgressive accumulation of amyloid and NFTs in the brain tissue eventually results in neuronal death and diffuse brain atrophy 10, which can be measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been extensively used to measure morphological changes in studies of AD during the past two decades 11. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex have been identified as the main areas of most severe atrophy in AD 11. Atrophy in the medial temporal lobe can predict the development of AD and the rate of progression from MCI to AD 12,13.\nDegeneration in AD mainly affects grey matter (GM). However, findings also indicate early white matter (WM) changes 14. WM abnormalities have been reported by many groups using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 15. DTI is a quantitative MRI technique that measures the self-diffusion movement of water molecules within the tissue microstructure 16. The two most common measures are diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). FA measures the degree of anisotropy of water self-diffusion in tissue, and MD is a rotationally invariant scalar measure used to describe the local magnitude of diffusion regardless of direction. DTI has mainly been used to investigate regional changes in WM, but it can also be adopted to study the microstructural alterations of GM 17,18. DTI measurements in the hippocampus are reliable and precise 19 and it has been shown that the MD increases in the hippocampus with increasing disease severity in AD 20.\nBased on knowledge accumulated over the last few decades of CSF biomarkers, GM atrophy and microstructural changes in AD 21,22, we postulated that the biomarkers that reflect AD pathology during disease progression (SCI-MCI-AD) are associated with GM atrophy and microstructural changes. To test this hypothesis, voxel-based analyses of MRI data were performed to characterize the correlations between the independently measured CSF biomarkers, GM volume and diffusion parameters in a clinical sample of patients with SCI, MCI and AD. The default mode network (DMN) is known to overlap with the anatomical distributions of amyloid deposition 23 and accumulation of NFTs 24 in AD. A recent study using the resting-state functional MRI technique has provided evidence that abnormal functional connectivity in the DMN is also associated with CSF biomarkers in AD 25. Therefore, in the present study, we will also focus on the DMN-related brain regions.",

Therefore, individuals with SCI, MCI and established AD were included in this study; a total of 78 subjects, who also participated in our previous study 25, were included in the final data analysis. All subjects were recruited from the Memory Clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge in Stockholm, Sweden, between November 2010 and February 2012, and underwent clinical evaluations, lumbar puncture, blood tests and MRI examinations. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (Approval number 20111987-314), and all participants provided written informed consent.\nOverall, 21 patients were diagnosed with AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases. MCI was defined according to the criteria of Winblad et al. 26. Patients categorized as having SCI had cognitive memory complaints but without impairment according to objective cognitive tasks 7.\nAll participants underwent lumbar puncture to measure the levels of CSF biomarkers. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to specifically measure the concentrations of Ab42 27, T-tau (measuring both normal tau and hyperphosphorylated tau) 28 and P-tau 181p 29 in CSF. All CSF samples were analysed at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge.",

For GM maps, ICV was also added as a covariate 32. The threshold for statistical significance was set to P  0.05 corrected at the cluster level (with cluster-forming threshold t  2.66) for multiple comparisons. The percentage of overlap between brain regions with statistical significance and the DMN template, which is from GIFT Toolbox (http:mialab.mrn.orgsoftwaregift), was calculated.\nAccording to the hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers proposed by Sperling and colleagues 33, levels of the biomarkers change at different rates during the clinical course, and SCI may be the first detectable stage in the development of AD 7. Thus, in the present study, we extended voxelwise results to the partial correlation test, a nonimage statistical method, both for the entire group and for each diagnostic group separately. The average FA and MD values of regions with statistical significance were calculated at the individual level using the FSLMEANTS program in FSL.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we assessed the correlations between CSF biomarkers of AD, GM volume and WM changes.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationships between CSF biomarkers and GM volume, FA and MD in the whole brain in a clinical sample of patients with a wide range of cognitive impairment (SCI, MCI and AD). Our main findings were (i) the majority of CNS regions with statistically significant correlation with biomarkers of AD overlapped with the DMN, and extended to the adjacent WM; (ii) GM volume was significantly correlated with levels of Ab42 and T-tau for the entire cohort, but there were no statistically significant correlations within the AD, MCI and SCI groups separately; (iii) FA was only positively correlated with Ab42 concentration in the entire cohort and in the AD and MCI groups separately; and (iv) MD was associated with CSF levels of Ab42 and T-tau in the entire cohort, as well as in the MCI and SCI groups. T-tau and P-tau 181p are very common in AD and are even observed in some patients with MCI or SCI 8,35,36. In this study, there were 13 subjects with MCI and three with SCI with decreased CSF Ab42 andor increased T-tau and P-tau 181p levels. Furthermore, an AD profile in CSF could predict conversion to AD from MCI 8,37.\nThe relationships between CSF biomarkers and GM volume in patients with AD or MCI have previously been investigated in several studies 21,38,39. In the present study, lower Ab42 and higher T-tau levels were significantly associated with decreased GM volume in a wide area, which is consistent with previous findings. No significant correlation between P-tau 181p and GM volume was found; this may be due to the presence of other tau proteins instead of P-tau 181p , such as phosphorylated tau at position threonine 231, which may be related to brain atrophy 40.\nIn addition to brain atrophy, decreased FA and increased MD have been reported in many studies in patients with AD or MCI 15,41. The accumulation of NFTs leads to neuronal death and disturbances of tissue homogeneity 16. Extracellular amyloid deposition could increase water diffusion of brain tissue 42. It was reported that the concentration of T-tau in CSF was negatively correlated with FA in a cohort of patients with MCISCI 43. In another study, patients with MCI with high T-tau levels were found to have a higher rate of decreased FA than normal control subjects 22. DTI has been used to identify altered water diffusivity in the GM. As in the present study, Bendlin et al. 44, recently investigated the relationship between CSF biomarkers and DTI measurements across the entire brain in healthy adults at risk of AD. The authors demonstrated a correlation between T-tau concentration and MD and found that Ab42 was associated with lower FA. These results are consistent with the results of the present study. However, Bendlin et al. 44 also showed statistically significant correlations between MD and CSF levels of Ab42. This may be due to the fact that the cohort was different compared with that in the present study, and CSF data were not collected at the same time as the MRI acquisition in their study.\nIt is interesting that the majority of regions with significant correlations between structural changes in the CNS and CSF biomarkers overlapped with the DMN and extended to the adjacent WM. The DMN is a specific set of brain regions observed in brain imaging research, which includes the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortexprecuneus and parietal cortex 45. Some studies have also investigated the subregions of the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus 46. The DMN components, especially the hippocampus, are involved in episodic memory processing. Episodic memory loss is the earliest symptom of AD. Moreover, in agreement with the present findings, the DMN overlapped with the anatomical distributions of amyloid deposition and atrophy in patients with AD 23 and was the preferential region of NFT accumulation 24. The exact cause of these changes is difficult to determine; nevertheless, all these results support the view that pathological changes in AD could be reflected by CSF biomarkers and detected using VBM analysis and DTI measurements. The MD is a more sensitive measurement to detect typical AD changes than GM atrophy and FA.\nOur results support the model of Sperling et al. 33, which was adapted from a theory proposed by Jack and co-workers of the role of dynamic biomarkers in the pathological cascade in AD 47. According to this model, the most widely validated biomarkers of AD, including markers of Ab deposition, neuronal injury, dysfunction and neurodegeneration, become abnormal and reach a maximum level in an ordered manner. None of the biomarkers is static, and rates of change of each differ over time and follow a nonlinear course, which is hypothesized to be sigmoid in shape 33.\nIn the present study, changes in GM volume and brain microstructure were found to be associated with CSF biomarkers in the entire group, which indicates that although these biomarkers follow a similar course during the progression of the disease, it is not the exact same course. However, at a given point, the slopes (rate of change) of biomarker levels might be different; for example, MD was correlated with levels of Ab42 and T-tau both in patients with MCI and in those with SCI, but not in the AD group. This temporal lag may be altered by factors such as brain reserve and coexisting pathologies 33. Although studies have provided evidence to support this model of a relation between biomarkers and disease stage in AD, some of the proposed relationships have yet to be proven 47; therefore, further studies are required to determine the validity of this model. This study has several limitations. First, the results should be confirmed in a larger sample. Secondly, some variables, including age and gender, were controlled for, but other factors might still confound the association. For instance, the effect of the APOE gene was not taken into account. Thirdly, we only assessed the correlations between the CSF biomarkers and GM volume, FA and MD at one time-point. Whether correlations (if observed) persist or increase in magnitude in individuals who develop MCI or AD is unknown; therefore, additional longitudinal studies are warranted. Finally, the presence of occult AD-related pathological changes based on the presence of CSF biomarker changes without autopsy confirmation of NFTs and APs was inferred.\nIn summary, our findings suggest that early pathological changes in AD can be detected with VBM analysis and DTI measurements. Although the exact cause of these changes has not been identified, the data indicate that brain microstructural alterations measured by variations in MD are an early event in AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, the regions in which CSF biomarkers were associated with structural brain changes in AD were related to the DMN. These findings provide further knowledge of the relationship between CSF biomarkers and structural brain changes at different stages of AD and may increase understanding of the pathological changes in AD and thus support early diagnosis.",

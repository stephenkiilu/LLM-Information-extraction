    "abstract": "Background: Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80 of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), most commonly an overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between brain white matter (WM) changes in MS and OAB symptoms is poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to evaluate (i) microstructural WM differences across MS patients (pwMS) with OAB symptoms, patients without LUT symptoms, and healthy subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (ii) associations between clinical OAB symptom scores and DTI indices. Methods: Twenty-nine female pwMS mean age (SD) 43.3 years (9.4), including seventeen with OAB mean age (SD) 46.1 years (8.6) and nine without LUT symptoms mean age (SD) 37.5 years (8.9), and fourteen healthy controls (HCs) mean age (SD) 48.5 years (20) were scanned in a 3T MRI with a DTI protocol. Additionally, clinical scans were performed for WM lesion segmentation. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. The Urinary Symptom Profile questionnaire assessed OAB severity. Results: A statistically significant reduction in FA (p  0.004) was identified in microstructural WM in pwMS, compared with HCs. An inverse correlation was found between FA in frontal and parietal WM lobes and OAB scores (p  0.021) in pwMS. Areas of lower FA, although this did not reach statistical significance, were found in both frontal lobes and the rest of the non-dominant hemisphere in pwMS with OAB compared with pwMS without LUT symptoms (p  0.072). Conclusions: This study identified that lesions affecting different WM tracts in MS can result in OAB symptoms and demonstrated the role of the WM in the neural control of LUT functions. By using DTI, the association between OAB symptom severity and WM changes were identified, adding knowledge to the current LUT working model. As MS is predominantly a WM disease, these",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80 of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (pwMS), significantly impacting quality of life 1,2. The commonest LUT symptoms reported are storage or overactive bladder symptoms (OAB; defined as urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence and usually associated with daytime urinary frequency and nocturia) 3 and voiding symptoms (including slow andor intermittent stream, splitting or spraying, hesitancy, straining, and terminal dribble) 4,5. The pattern of LUT symptoms is influenced by the site of lesions in the central nervous system 6.\nIn recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular functional MRI (fMRI), has provided considerable insight into the central neural control of LUT functions 6,7. There are a number of cortical and subcortical regions identified that consistently show changes in neural activity during bladder-specific tasks 8,9. Insight has been gained into the role of these different regions such as the thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (mPFC and lPFC) during bladder filling and emptying, and distinct patterns of activation and deactivation are seen in cohorts of healthy subjects and in patients with idiopathic OAB 10. These findings have led to a network model, which proposes cerebral circuits for perception of bladder fullness and urgency 8. In MS, activation and deactivation have been seen in cortical and subcortical grey matter (GM) regions following a bladder infusion task 9,11. These studies focus on GM changes; however, MS is overwhelmingly a white matter (WM) disease and the nature of the relationship between WM lesions and LUT symptoms is unknown. Studies using MRI showed more WM changes in MS, compared with healthy people, not only due to the WM lesions but also in the normal-appearing WM 12. Regarding specific functions, microstructural WM changes were found to be widespread, interrupting structural pathways connecting remote brain regions and thus playing an important role in changes in cognitive function 13. In early MS, a stronger structural-to-functional coupling was identified, suggesting that the ability of the brain to reorganise functional networks could diminish at later stages of the disease and could no longer compensate the MS-related structural damage 14,15. Studies exploring treatment effects in GM for LUT symptoms in MS had proven difficult without the assessment of the degree of WM abnormalities between the relevant GM regions 16. Therefore, it is important to investigate not only the changes in GM in MS but also the WM impairment. In patients with other WM disorders, namely small vessel disease, structural MRI studies suggest that the anterior thalamic radiation and the superior longitudinal fasciculus are specifically important for LUT functions and are involved in continence control 10,17, and WM hyperintensity (WMH) in the anterior corona radiata and the cingulate gyrus is reported to predict urinary incontinence and degree of bother 18.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) evaluates the microscopic random thermal motion of water, and is used to provide microstructural information on WM in neurological diseases 19202122. Along WM tracts, water diffusion is more rapid, while it is slower in the direction perpendicular to the fibres 23. This property is captured-to some extent-by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), from which it is possible to obtain several scalar indices (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD; axial diffusivity, AD; radial diffusivity, RD) commonly used to characterise tissue microstructure properties 24. FA is the most frequently used index in clinical studies for its better sensitivity to tissue microstructure property changes and has also been shown to be reduced in the WM of pwMS, compared to healthy people 252627.\nIn this study, we aim to use DTI to explore the microstructural WM changes in a cohort of pwMS and compare differences in patients with and without LUT symptoms using voxel-wise analysis, and correlations between DTI measures (FA) and clinical scores of OAB, without a priori assumption on the location of the expected changes.",

The regional representation was based on the division of the WM and deep GM volume into sectors (representing the lobes) and radial regions (representing the distance from the ventricles) 39. Aggregation of cortical regions obtained from the Geodesic Information Flow (GIF) parcellation algorithm 40 applied to the brain in MNI space was used to obtain cortical lobes (or deep GM regions), and WM voxels were allocated to the closest cortical lobe. The lobes were illustrated as FRONT (frontal lobe), PAR (parietal lobe), TEMP (temporal lobe), OCC (occipital lobe), and BGIT (the basal ganglia, thalami, and infratentorial regions from both sides) 39. Radially, the application of the Laplace equation between the ventricular and cortical surfaces enabled the creation of a normalised distance measure that was divided into four equal parts providing the four equidistant radial layers 39. Overall, this systematic division of the volume of interest resulted in thirty-six regions (four layers and nine lobar separations) 39. This regional division of the WM volume allows for a local representation of the whole-brain results. In this study, distribution plots reflect the ratio between the number of voxels of interest (significant values) located in the specific region and the overall number of significant voxels, while the frequency plots were drawn as the ratio between number of significant voxels in a given region and volume of this region.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Current understanding of the central neural network controlling LUT functions is centred around different GM cortical and subcortical regions such as the thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, mPFC, and lPFC 8. Findings in the neural network that correlate with LUT dysfunction have been demonstrated in pwMS. In MS, the WM lesion distribution correlates with the clinical manifestations and disease course 42. The role of the connecting WM tracts in the regulation of LUT functions remains speculative 8 and this study aimed to explore the microstructural WM changes in association with OAB symptoms in pwMS. In this study, we explored differences in WM microstructure in MS-OAB and MS-no-LUTS by evaluating changes in FA using diffusion-weighted MRI. We identified FA reduction in the pwMS cohort compared with HC, which was consistent with the previous literature 25,43. There were two salient findings that demonstrate the relationship between changes in WM tracts and the occurrence of OAB symptoms.\nReductions in FA were observed in the MS-OAB group compared with MS-no-LUTS (Table 2) in regions including the corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the reductions in FA were consistent with previous studies 17,18. These tracts were particularly susceptible in pwMS and correlated with LUT symptoms. Among the identified tracts, WM changes in the corpus callosum have been widely reported in pwMS, accounting for various LUT functions; WM changes in the anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus had also been reported in pwMS, accounting for cognitive functions 25. After controlling for age and EDSS, taken as a measure of overall motor and functional disability, a significant FA reduction was seen in WM tracts in MS-OAB, suggesting that involvement of these WM tracts results in LUT symptoms. Taking into consideration the working model of LUT control based on previous studies evaluating GM structures 8, the findings from the present study suggested the presence of a suprapontine WM circuit supporting the LUT functional network, connecting the different GM regions involving the thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. In addition, WM studies assessing WMH in a cohort of elderly community-dwelling women from Kuchel et al. and Tadic et al. speculated the involvement of the cingulum, anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus for urinary incontinence 17,18. Our study confirmed the presence of FA reductions in these specific WM tracts as well using an established quantitative MRI technique and statistical analysis of the whole WM skeleton.\nWM changes were particularly observed in the frontal WM as expected. Bladder function, including attention and information processing speed in integrating the awareness of bladder filling and voiding, was associated with cognitive performance, pointing out a strong overlap of the brain structures involved 44. Regions in frontal WM were demonstrated to correlate with information processing speed and attention 15. The role of the prefrontal lobe in continence was established through seminal work by Andrew and Nathan 45, and the orbitofrontal or lPFC has been demonstrated to have extensive connections with the limbic system, including the insula, which was found to be the homeostatic afferent area projecting the sensation of bladder filling 46,47, and the anterior cingulate cortex, which mediated LUT functions together with the supplementary motor area through the perception of sensation of urgency and resultant contraction of the urethral sphincter 48. Moreover, differences were seen to extend beyond the frontal WM, and rather unexpectedly greater WM changes were seen in the entire non-dominant (right) hemisphere in the MS-OAB group (Figure 3a). Previous studies evaluating the cerebral control network of LUT functions had similarly demonstrated BOLD signal changes preferentially affecting the non-dominant insula and right lPFC 8. There was a non-dominant hemisphere prevalence presented in the median lesion volume plot (Figure 2b), and lesions of the right hemisphere would be consistent with the expected findings in the literature 18. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between interoceptive awareness and right GM regions, including the right insula and right thalamus 495051, and the findings from this study suggest that WM changes in the right hemisphere can also result in changes in visceral functions manifesting with LUT symptoms.\nA negative correlation was observed between FA and the USP-OAB sub-score, suggesting that a lower FA was associated with more severe OAB symptoms (Table 3). Considering that an important role for WM changes in the anterior corona radiata was shown to predict urinary incontinence severity in elderly women with small vessel disease 10,18, this study confirmed the importance of this tract in the neural control of LUT functions; moreover, our results suggested that there were additional WM tracts that, when affected by microstructure alterations, could contribute to LUT dysfunction (OAB) in neurological diseases (MS). It would be pertinent for future studies to confirm these findings in terms of the correlation with specific symptoms of OAB, such as urgency and frequency, and in other neurological disorders, such as small vessel disease.\nThere are some limitations of this study. In the group difference analysis, only a trend towards a significantly reduced FA (p  0.072) was observed in MS-OAB compared with MS-no-LUTS, after adjusting for age and EDSS. The small sample size and the differences in group size were likely to have been factors affecting the group difference results, though LUT symptoms are reported in 80 of pwMS and therefore a cohort of pwMS without LUT symptoms is uncommon and difficult to recruit. Secondly, LUT symptoms presented heterogeneously in MS, and the cohort we investigated was only a subset of a more complex group. There could have been a selection bias to select only female patients (EDSS  6.5) in our study, but this could be interpreted as an intended benefit of having a more uniform study population. Additionally, only the suprapontine subcortical WM changes were evaluated in this study and LUT symptoms can also arise from spinal cord lesions 1, which were not assessed. Lastly, the EDSS score used for measuring MS disability includes a bladder functional symptom score which may account for a decrease in significance when regressing EDSS for LUT symptoms. Greater correlation with involvement of WM in the non-dominant hemisphere needs to be evaluated in further studies to understand whether this contributes to the mechanisms of LUT dysfunction only in MS or whether it is a salient characteristic in LUT dysfunction.",

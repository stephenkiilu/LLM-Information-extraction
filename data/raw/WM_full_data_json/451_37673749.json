    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multi-modal imaging techniques have furthered our understanding of how different aspects of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology relate to one another. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures such as mean diffusivity (MD) may be a surrogate measure of the changes in gray matter structure associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has been used to quantify synaptic loss, which is the major pathological correlate of cognitive impairment in AD. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gray matter microstructure and synaptic density.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of pathological changes and neuronal damage in the brain. Neuroimaging has improved our understanding of these changes by enabling the in vivo investigation of AD neurobiology. New imaging modalities and biomarkers have the potential to provide an even more detailed description of AD pathophysiology and disease progression. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality, has been used as a surrogate measure of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) tissue microscopic architecture (1)(2)(3)(4). Because DTI measures the diffusion of water molecules within tissues, alterations to microscopic barriers such as cell membranes and myelin can alter DTI outcomes by eliminating restrictions on the Brownian motion of water molecules (5). One quantitative measure of diffusivity in GM is mean diffusivity (MD), which measures the average magnitude of water diffusion in all directions for each image voxel (6). Evidence from multiple studies suggests that MD exhibits a biphasic pattern in AD, with an initial reduction during the preclinical stage of disease followed by an increase during the symptomatic phase (3,7,8). Although the specific mechanisms underlying these diffusivity changes remain unclear, cellular hypertrophy and inflammation in the preclinical stage of AD may reduce the extracellular space, decreasing the free diffusion of water (9). As AD progresses, cellular atrophy, synapse loss, and extracellular matrix breakdown may begin to exert the opposite effect by reducing barriers to diffusion (6). These diffusivity changes appear to be region-dependent, with the greatest increases in GM MD observed in areas known to be affected in AD (2,4,10,11). For example, elevated hippocampal MD has been extensively reported in various studies (10,(12)(13)(14) and shown to be a better predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia than hippocampal atrophy (12).\nGiven that synapse loss is the strongest structural correlate of cognitive decline due to AD based on postmortem pathological studies (15)(16)(17), microstructural changes seen in AD may also be related to synaptic loss. Recent advances in PET have allowed for in vivo quantification of gray matter synaptic density using tracers for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a presynaptic protein expressed in nearly all synapses (18,19). Consistent with pathological studies, synaptic density is consistently lower in participants with AD in studies using the SV2A radioligand  11 CUCB-J (20,21) and in a study using  18 FUCB-H (22). Recently, we demonstrated that in vivo synaptic density is strongly correlated with cognitive performance in a sample of individuals with AD (23). These in vivo synaptic imaging studies have also provided evidence for cross-sectional (24-27) associations with fibrillary tau and amyloid β (Aβ), as well as a longitudinal (28) association with fibrillary tau accumulation in AD. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gray matter diffusivity measured with DTI MRI and synaptic density measured with PET. We first focused on the hippocampus, a region affected early in AD pathogenesis by increased gray matter diffusivity and synaptic loss. We then performed a whole brain analysis to explore the pattern of association between gray matter microstructure and synaptic density in groups with both AD and normal cognition.",

      "text": "MRI was performed on a 3T scanner and included both a structural T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence and an echo-planar imaging (EPI) DTI sequence. T1 images were 256  256  176 with a pixel size of 0.98  0.98  1.0 mm and DTI images were 128  128  64 with a pixel size of 2.0  2.0  2.0 mm. DTI was performed on either a Siemens Prisma Fit scanner with repetition time  7200 ms, echo time  56 ms, b-values  1000 smm2, and 54 diffusion directions or on a Siemens TIM Trio scanner with repetition time  7900 ms, echo time  85 ms, b-values  1000 smm2, and 25 diffusion directions.\nFreeSurfer version 6.0 was used to pre-process T1 and DTI images (29). Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed on T1 images to define regions of interest (ROIs) that were used for both MRI and PET analyses in native participant space. FreeSurfers dtrecon was used to construct DTI tensors, generate diffusion maps, and co-register DTI and structural T1 images. Additionally, we employed several preprocessing steps to minimize the effects of head motion and eddy currents. A detailed description of dtrecon can be found at http:surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edufswikidt_recon. After the initial Freesurfer reconstruction and diffusion map generation, all output images were visually inspected for irregularities. No images were excluded due to poor quality.\nA correction for voxel averaging to minimize cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal contamination in gray matter voxels was implemented based on the method developed by Koo et al. (30). Tissue probability maps for GM and CSF were constructed from a T1 segmentation using FSL Fast (FSL version 6). Maps were then down-sampled and co-registered to diffusion space. Equations 2 and 3 from Koo et al. were applied to the probability maps to calculate the apparent signal fraction of GM (λ app-gm ) in each voxel. A mask was generated from voxels with an λ app-gm greater than 0.5. Finally, MD within each ROI was computed from voxels with an λ app-gm greater than 0.5.",

List-mode data were reconstructed using the MOLAR algorithm (32) with eventby-event motion correction based on an optical detector (Vicra, NDI Systems, Waterloo, Canada) (33). Dynamic  11 CPiB scans were acquired for 90 min following a bolus of up to 555 MBq of tracer (34) and dynamic  11 CUCB-J scans were acquired for 60 or 90 min after administration of a bolus of up to 740 MBq (35). Software motion correction was applied to the dynamic PET images using a mutual-information algorithm (FSL-FLIRT) to perform frame-by-frame registration to a summed image (0-10min). A summed motion corrected PET image was used to create a registration between T1 MRIs and PET scans for each participant. This PET to MRI registration was used to apply participant specific ROIs to parametric PET images. The limited spatial resolution of PET can lead to partial volume effects that have greater potential to bias outcomes in individuals with significant brain atrophy. This may be of particular importance in studies of neurodegenerative disease when directly correlating PET to MRI outcomes. Therefore, partial volume correction (PVC) of  11 CUCB-J dynamic images was performed using the Iterative Yang (IY) approach (36,37). Kinetic analysis was performed using in-house software. For  11 CPiB image analysis, parametric images of BP ND were generated using a simplified reference tissue model-2 step (SRTM2) (38) and then converted to distribution volume ratio (DVR)  1  BP ND as previously described (34). The  11 CPiB PET scan was considered positive if both visual and quantitative criteria were met. Visual criteria entailed consensus of 2 experienced readers and quantitative criteria required a  11 CPiB cerebral-to-cerebellar distribution volume ratio (DVR) of 1.40 or more in at least 1 AD-affected ROI (39). For  11 CUCB-J image analysis, parametric images of BP ND were generated using a SRTM2 from 0-60 min (38) with whole cerebellum as the reference region and then converted to DVR  1  BP ND (27).",

For this analysis, a general linear model was fit with predictors of MRI scanner, age, sex, diagnosis, synaptic density, and the interaction between diagnosis and synaptic density to predict MD. The F value, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and two tailed P value were reported to convey the goodness of fit of the regression model. In addition, standardized regression coefficients (β), effect size η 2 , and two tailed P values were calculated for each predictor variable. The secondary analysis involved the computation of Pearsons correlation coefficients (r) and two-sided P values for all FreeSurfer brain regions. A Fisher r-to-z transformation was used to assess for a statistically significant difference in the correlations between the AD and CN groups (two-tailed P values reported).

    "Association between synaptic density (DVR) and mean diffusivity in the hippocampus": {
      "text": "The primary analysis investigated the association of synaptic density and MD in the bilateral hippocampus. Separate univariate linear regressions for the AD and CN groups demonstrated a significant inverse association in participants with AD (r  -0.55, P  0.001, df  31; Figure 2A) but not CN (r  0.13, P  0.62, df  15; Figure 2A). The negative correlation between synaptic density and MD in the AD group was significantly stronger than the correlation in the CN group (Fisher z  -2.31, P  0.02). Because atrophy due to AD may lead to an underestimation of synaptic density measured with PET, we repeated the analysis after partial volume correction of the PET data. After PVC, the results were similar with a significant inverse association between synaptic density and MD in the AD group (r  -0.58, P  0.001, df  31; Figure 2B), but not the CN group (r  0.16, P  0.55, df  15; Figure 2B). As before, the negative correlation between synaptic density and MD in the AD group was significantly stronger than the correlation in the CN group (Fisher z  -2.55, P  0.01).

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In this study we examined the relationship between synaptic density using  11 CUCB-J PET and GM microstructure using DTI. As expected, GM microstructure represented by MD was higher in participants with AD compared to a CN group. We report the novel finding that reductions in hippocampal synaptic density are associated with increased hippocampal MD in participants with AD, but not in a CN group. Significant inverse associations between synaptic density and GM MD were also found in other early AD-affected brain regions of the temporal lobe, but this relationship was not present in individuals without cognitive impairment.\nConsistent with previous works (1-4, 10, 14, 40), our study found elevated MD in AD compared to CN participants. The pattern of MD differences observed in our study seems to reflect that of early AD pathology, since significantly affected regions include medial temporal structures such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, as well as anterior, inferior, and lateral parts of the temporal lobes. Although the precise neural correlates of MD are not fully understood, neuropathology studies suggest that cortical DTI measures are affected by anisotropic diffusion along vertical cortical minicolumns (41,42). AD has been shown to disrupt minicolumn structure, initially due to neurite loss, and then later due to cell death (43,44), and DTI has been used to measure these minicolumn changes (11,40,43,45,46). Our studys finding that synaptic density is inversely associated with MD in AD-affected regions suggests that synapse loss co-occurs with these other cytoarchitectural changes in early AD. In contrast, analysis of the CN group yielded inconsistent associations between synaptic density and GM MD in the caudate and precentral gyrus. Significant inverse associations were present in the bilateral caudate both before and after PVC of PET data, but in the precentral gyrus, the inverse association was only significant after PVC. There were no significant associations between SV2A and MD in the CN group after correction for multiple comparisons. The lack of a robust findings across analysis methods suggests these inconsistent associations maybe be due to type I errors. Another possibility is that the CN group may be related to non-AD subclinical pathology. Additional analysis in a larger group of CN participants is needed to clarify this finding.\nFuture studies that use imaging methods with multiple fluid compartments such as neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging (NODDI) may provide a more detailed description of synaptic pathology in AD (47,48). NODDI provides more precise measures of postsynaptic dendritic structure, which can be compared to the loss of presynaptic density measured by  11 CUCB-J PET. This contrasts with MD, which is likely influenced not only by postsynaptic dendrites but also other unmyelinated tissue features (42).\nPrevious studies have also used multi-modal imaging to determine how diffusivity changes relate to other neuropathological features of AD. Rodriguez-Vieitez et al. combined DTI with PET to demonstrate that tau, but not amyloid deposition, is positively associated with cortical MD (45). Similarly, Torso et al. showed that alterations to minicolumn structure are associated with both amyloid and tau deposition in AD (11). Another study found that decreased MD in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) correlates with astrocytosis, as measured by  11 C-DED PET, suggesting that neuroinflammation may disrupt cortical microstructure (9). This study suggests a biphasic relationship between disease stage and MD since preclinical participants with ADAD had lower GM MD compared to CN participants without ADAD, but ADAD participants in symptomatic disease stages had higher GM MD compared to CN participants without ADAD. The use of  11 C-DED PET allowed the authors to investigate the complex relationship between astrocytosis and GM microstructure. They proposed that the biphasic MD changes are partly driven by early astrocytosis in preclinical ADAD that is later overwhelmed by the loss of neurites, synapses, or other neuropil elements. This GM MD increase during clinical AD is consistent with our results since our group of participants with early clinical AD have increased MD and lower synaptic density that are highly correlated with the AD group. Future multimodal imaging studies of synaptic density and GM microstructure can also incorporate core AD biomarkers of tau, amyloid, and macrostructural neurodegeneration (i.e., cortical thickness or gray matter volume). Taken together, multi-modal studies provide opportunities to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of AD-related GM microstructural changes.",

First, DTI is susceptible to bias due to voxel averaging, and we performed a correction for voxel averaging to minimize CSF signal contamination in gray matter (30) to minimize this effect. Future studies can provide less biased and more detailed measures of GM microstructure using NODDI. The cross-sectional design and limited disease stages represented in this sample reduce our ability to clarify the longitudinal relationship between synaptic density and GM microstructure. Studies that include participants with preclinical AD and longitudinal assessments would be optimal.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disease in elderly individuals. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and further development to dementia (d-AD) are considered to be major stages of the progressive pathological development of AD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), one of the most important modalities of MRI, can describe the microstructure of white matter through its tensor model. It is widely used in understanding the central nervous system mechanism and finding appropriate potential biomarkers for the early stages of AD. Based on the multilevel analysis methods of DTI (voxelwise, fiberwise and networkwise), we summarized that AD patients mainly showed extensive microstructural damage, structural disconnection and topological abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fornix, and medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and cingulum. The diffusion features and structural connectomics of specific regions can provide information for the early assisted recognition of AD. The classification accuracy of SCD and normal controls can reach 92.68 at present. And due to the further changes of brain structure and function, the classification accuracy of MCI, d-AD and normal controls can reach more than 97. Finally, we summarized the limitations of current DTI-based AD research and propose possible future research directions.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a common degenerative aging disease of the nervous system. The main pathological features include amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein in the brain, and the progressive loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex is one of the main causes of dementia (Braak and Braak, 1995;Jack et al., 2013). Current research usually divides years or even decades and the progressive AD process into subjective cognitive decline (Jessen et al., 2014(Jessen et al., , 2020;;Rabin et al., 2017;Slot et al., 2019) (SCD, asymptomatic high-risk preclinical stage, no objective neuropsychiatric defects but with individual complaints of cognitive decline in memory), mild cognitive impairment (McKhann et al., 2011;Yeung et al., 2022) (MCI, AD prodromal stage, memory and cognitive dysfunction in standard assessment, partial AD biomarkers) and Alzheimers dementia (Dubois et al., 2010) (d-AD, AD biomarker and severe dementia). Although currently known interventions for Alzheimers disease are most effective in d-AD (Jack et al., 2018), SCD individuals in the preclinical stage of AD have developed biomarkers associated with AD (Dubois et al., 2007;Sperling et al., 2011).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly improved the understanding of neural mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD due to its high soft tissue resolution (Habib et al., 2017;Mak et al., 2017a;Dong et al., 2020). With the help of T1 imaging, Saykin et al. found that gray matter atrophy occurred in the medial temporal lobe and frontotemporal region in SCD and MCI (Saykin et al., 2006), while Meiberth et al. found that the cortical thickness of the left entorhinal cortex in SCD was significantly reduced (Meiberth et al., 2015), which is an important feature of the structural changes of gray matter in early AD patients. Hayes et al., through the memory coding task combined with functional MRI (fMRI), found that the subsequent memory effects decreased in the occipital lobe, the superior parietal lobe and the default mode network in SCD (Hayes et al., 2017). The above MRI modalities provided references for understanding the central neural mechanism of AD at the cortical level. Although AD is often considered a disease caused by abnormal gray matter that leads to cognitive decline, an increasing number of studies have shown that progressive white matter (WM) degeneration and demyelination are important pathological features of AD (Nasrabady et al., 2018). Therefore, studies on WM are also of great importance.\nAxons transmit nerve impulses between cortical neurons. The WM they form is the structural connection of information transmission and communication in the brain network, and the intercortical connection mode dominated by WM connection achieves cortical alienation (Paus et al., 2014). The study of the abnormal structure and function of WM can reveal how the brain carries out network or whole-brain neural activity through structural connections combined with the characteristics of the cortex. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an effective imaging method to observe the microstructure and properties of WM in vivo (Le Bihan et al., 1986), and its diffusion measures can reflect the structural abnormalities of neuron axon injury or demyelination. In addition, neural fibers were used to trace the macroscopic structural connections of the whole brain, and the ability of brain information integration and separation in AD patients was measured through the structural connection network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009;He and Evans, 2010;Jeurissen et al., 2019). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), one of the most commonly used models for dMRI, can reveal the structural impairment and dysfunction of WM in AD patients through the combination of microscopic neural structure and macroscopic network activity, which can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the abnormal neural mechanism of AD and intervention treatment.\nThe concept of dMRI was first proposed in 1995, aiming to achieve the visualization of geometrically arranged WM bundles macroscopically through the nonfree diffusion of water molecules in brain tissues (Basser, 1995). In the following years, dMRI and its DTI model were successively applied to the study of AD (Hanyu et al., 1999;Rose et al., 2000). DTI can reveal the microscopic details of neural tissue structure, making DTI an effective tool to detect subtle and early changes in different WM-related diseases beyond traditional neuroimaging (Teipel et al., 2014). With the updating and standardization of DTI methodology, voxelwise analysis (Smith et al., 2006) and the exploration of WM abnormalities by tractography (Maier-Hein et al., 2017) in AD have been carried out in depth. Recently, the study of multimodality brain networks in neuropsychiatric diseases has been in full swing, and research on AD brain structure networks constructed based on DTI provides effective help to understand the macro central nervous mechanism of AD (Madden et al., 2012). Furthermore, combined with the WM dispersion characteristics provided by DTI and artificial intelligence technology, current research has made breakthroughs in the early assisted recognition of AD (Chen et al., 2022).\nIn this review, we summarized recent studies of WM changes in AD using DTI. First, we give a brief introduction to the dMRI and DTI methodology. Subsequently, based on multilevel DTI analysis, we reviewed the studies on WM abnormalities in the progressive disease development process of AD. Furthermore, the assisted recognition of early AD using the above imaging features was summarized. Finally, based on the current research results and methodological progress, we discuss the limitations and future research directions of AD research based on neuroimaging.",

      "text": "MRI images tissues by measuring proton signals noninvasively in vivo, where more than 90 of protons are located in water molecules. Interestingly, owing to some directional factors, such as cytomembrane of neurons or myelin, the diffusion of water molecules in brain tissues is independent of the direction (Moseley et al., 1991). It is mainly divided into two kinds: free water molecules diffusing in each direction, called isotropic diffusion, and neuron axon axial diffusion because of myelin, called anisotropic diffusion. In particular, water diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid tends to be isotropic, whereas water in WM fibers tends to be anisotropic along axons (Beaulieu, 2002). Therefore, dMRI signal strength is sensitive to the diffusion of water and reveals microscopic details of WM fibers, such as axon orientation, by observing different diffusion patterns of water molecules in the brain. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance variant imaging technique that displays the diffusion rates of water in different directions (Taylor and Bushell, 1985;Le Bihan et al., 1986).\nDTI utilizes an ellipsoidal tensor model to represent the diffusion situation of water molecules in the brain based on the symmetric positive determinate tensor field derived from DWI and can reflect the organization and structure of WM, which is the most commonly used model of dMRI (Basser et al., 1994). By measuring each voxel degree of diffusion in three dimensions, a tensor model of three eigenvalues and three characteristic vectors is used to characterize the molecular diffusion direction and degree. λ 1 is the main eigenvalue for characterization of axon axial diffusion, while λ 2 and λ 3 are eigenvalues for characterization of axon vertical diffusion. Axons in WM exhibit a tendency of axial diffusion (λ 1  λ 2  λ 3 ), while the somas and water in the cerebrospinal fluid showed isotropic diffusion (λ 1  λ 2  λ 3 ) (Fig. 1A). Then, diffusion measures such as anisotropy fraction (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) can be derived from the three eigenvalues of the tensor model, which are often used to describe the microanatomy of WM (Tournier, 2019). FA is sensitive to myelination, axon consistency, diameter and density and can reflect the integrity of white matter fiber microstructure. FA will decrease when axon diameter is larger or there is a fiber intersection (Jones et al., 2013). MD is the average degree of dispersion of water molecules, which is usually negatively correlated with FA, and it is usually low in white matter and high in cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, MD is widely used in the study of clinical stroke and is sensitive to a wide range of brain pathological features (Horsfield and Jones, 2002). AxD and RD represent the axial and radial directions of microscopic water motion, respectively. When axonal injury occurs in white matter, AxD usually decreases (Winklewski et al., 2018), while RD is often increased in demyelinated axons due to loss of obstruction due to vertical axial diffusion (Song et al., 2002). Furthermore, based on the diffusion measures, DTI analysis is usually performed at the whole-brain voxel level (voxelwise), WM fiber bundle level (fiberwise) and WM structure connection network level (networkwise).\nWhole brain voxel-based analysis (VBA) normalized the brain images into a standard template space and conducted a comparative analysis of the diffusion measures of each voxel in the whole brain (Wright et al., 1995;Abe et al., 2010). As the high noise contained by a large number of voxels in an image requires spatial smoothing and the hypothesis of a statistical test is that the brain normalization of subjects is completely consistent, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is proposed as an optimization algorithm (Astrakas and Argyropoulou, 2010;Jones and Cercignani, 2010;Van Hecke et al., 2010). TBSS overcomes the limitation of the registration algorithm and spatial smoothing based on the registration of FA maps and skeleton detection. It effectively improves the sensitivity of diffusion imaging and objectivity and significantly increases the statistical effectiveness of voxelwise, which has become the mainstream technique of voxelwise AD research (Smith et al., 2006). In conclusion, VBA and TBSS are used to study the diffusion characteristics of brain microstructure at the voxel level and are not sensitive to the presupposition, so they are suitable for exploratory research (Fig. 1B).\nVoxelwise analysis can search for intergroup differences and correlations of diffusion measures among millions of voxels in the whole brain. On the other hand, the diffusion and morphological changes of WM fibers were explored in commissural fibers, association fibers and projection fibers. At present, the mainstream fiber extraction methods include ROI-based WM segmentation and tractography. ROI-based WM segmentation uses prior brain templates to register the individual diffusion measure maps to standard templates for qualitative fiber location and extraction. The JHU White Matter Tractography Atlas is currently the most commonly used WM template (Hua et al., 2008) (Fig. 3A). Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) artificially selects tracking start voxels, starting from the voxel center to the principal direction of main tensor extension until the voxel boundary or meeting the tracking termination conditions (Zhu and Guo, 2012). Fibers have many intersection regions, while there may be multiple fibers with different orientations within a single voxel. Therefore, the estimation of the diffusion parameters through the partial probability density function, further to estimate connection probability between voxels named probabilistic tractography, has greatly increased the credibility of tractography (Behrens et al., 2003). Through fiber extraction or tractography, the characteristics of fibers of interest can be obtained to discuss the structural abnormalities of WM fiberwise (Leclercq et al., 2011) (Fig. 1C).\nThe statistics of the whole-brain voxels with diffusion measures reflect the characteristic information of the brain microstructure, while the brain structure network formed by tractography combined with a prior atlas can represent the macroscopic physical path of information exchange and reveal structural connection patterns and organizational structures. The gray matter cortex was divided into a series of nodes by atlas, and the edges of connecting nodes were defined by tractography (FA weighted, MD weighted and fiber number weighted network). Nodes and edges form a complex brain network graph, and the characteristic parameters of small-world attributes, such as the clustering coefficient and path length, can be calculated based on graph theory to describe the topology of the brain network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009;delEtoile and Adeli, 2017). Briefly, the clustering coefficient represents the tightness of local interconnection within the network, while the path length represents the ability of information exchange and transmission in the network. If the network has a smaller shortest path length and a higher clustering coefficient, the network has efficient information transmission and communication with a lower wiring cost called the small-world attribute, which is the most important characteristic of the brain network. According to the graph theory characteristic of the network, the degree of small-world, rich-club or modularity of the brain network can be measured, and the abnormal structural connection of AD can be analyzed and understood from the macroscopic network level (Watts and Strogatz, 1998;Kim and Min, 2020) (Fig. 1D).\nTo determine how the above multilevel WM features such as diffusion measures and structural connectomes develop in the progressive phases of AD, statistical methods are usually used to analyze their changes. Since the diffusion measures and structural connections are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, in two-group and multigroup comparisons, the mean values of imaging features are usually compared using the independent sample t test and analysis of variance, respectively (Brueggen et al., 2019). Analysis of covariance should be considered to avoid the influence of covariates such as age, sex and education level on the results (Shao et al., 2019). Linear models have been widely used in the analysis of diffusion features due to their strong explanatory power and effectiveness on sparse data (Shu et al., 2018). Similar to fMRI, statistical analysis of DTI increases the probability of type I error due to multiple hypothesis testing. Therefore, multiple comparison correction methods such as family wise error and false discovery rate are widely used to correct the statistical results of diffusion features.",

      "text": "Compared with normal controls (NC), AD patients showed abnormal WM microstructure and disconnection as early as the preclinical SCD stage, mainly manifested as reduced FA, increased MD, AxD and RD, and destruction of structural network topology attributes. The degree of WM abnormality and disconnection in SCD is between NC and MCI (Wang et al., 2012;Shao et al., 2019), which may indicate that SCD precedes objective cognitive decline in the progressive process of AD, and abnormal changes in WM have already occurred in the stage of SCD. Identifying imaging biomarkers of SCD is of great significance for understanding the ultra-early phase pathology of AD and identifying the Diffusion measure voxelwise analysis based on VBA and TBSS showed that WM microstructural abnormalities were found in the hippocampus, parahippocampus and medial temporal lobe regions in SCD (Li et al., 2016;Ryu et al., 2017) (Fig. 2A), which were significantly correlated with cognitive and memory functions (Wang et al., 2012). WM microstructure destruction may precede overburden gray matter atrophy (Selnes et al., 2012), but it has also been suggested that SCD gray matter and WM are interrelated in the degenerative process (Cedres et al., 2021;Liang et al., 2021). In the SCD commissural fibers, the body, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) all showed WM disorders (Lee et al., 2016;Li et al., 2016;Brueggen et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020) (Fig. 2B). The CC connects the vast areas on both sides of the hemispheres and is widely connected with the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes.

      "text": "The global and local efficiency of bilateral prefrontal regions and left thalamus in SCD were reduced, the connection strength between SCD hubs was reduced, and the reduction of rich-club connection strength and local connection strength in SCD was associated with impaired memory performance. (Shu et al., 2018) Abbreviations: from the frontal lobe and passes through the parietal and occipital lobe to connect the above lobes. The radiative corolla, the upper and lower projection fibers that connect the cerebral cortex with subcortical structures, was widely abnormal in diffusion measures (Lee et al., 2016;Li et al., 2016;Brueggen et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020). Furthermore, SCD patients with ApoE ε4 were more likely to have myelin damage in splenium of CC and anterior corona radiata (Lee et al., 2016). SCD WM integrity was correlated with plasma Aβ40 levels (Wang et al., 2020), while some studies showed that diffusion measures were more predictive of d-AD and AD-specific medial temporal lobe atrophy than CSF biomarkers (Selnes et al., 2013). The increase in RD in SCD may be related to demyelination and may be the main cause of WM abnormalities in SCD, while the increase in AxD by local axon injury may play a secondary role (Li et al., 2016). Among various diffusion measures, FA is considered to be helpful to distinguish the progression of AD (Li et al., 2016;Tu et al., 2018). However, because the increase in RD and AxD at the same time may counteract FA changes, some studies believe that MD, RD and AxD describing the diffusion degree are more suitable for the diagnosis of AD (Selnes et al., 2012).\nThe WM fiber segmentation strategy based on the atlas can extract regions of interest based on the prior atlas. Similar to the voxelwise results, SCD patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) had similar patterns of WM microstructure damage in the left hippocampal cingulum region with abnormal diffusion measures, but there was no significant correlation with objective memory function. Cognitive performance in SCD, as in healthy individuals, showed that the integrity of WM may precede objective memory loss (Luo et al., 2019;Shao et al., 2019). In addition, the results of fiber diffusion measures combined with cortical thickness showed that the bilateral parahippocampus and left entorhinal cortex were significantly atrophied in the SCD group, and the anisotropy of the bilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF) was significantly reduced. The decrease in cortical thickness in the medial temporal subregion corresponded to the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles, and the early degeneration of the UF is consistent with the degeneration hypothesis.\nThe entorhinal cortex and UF are fragile and are involved in content-related episodic memory in SCD (Fan et al., 2018). By using the automated Bayesian global tractography algorithm, Raymond et al. extracted the neuronal density values, FA and MD of the bilateral parahippocampal cingulum, cingulum and UF in SCD and NC but did not find any differences in the neuronal density, FA or MD between groups (Viviano et al., 2019).\nTractography combined with atlas can quantify the brain structural network based on the number of intercortical fiber connections, which has been widely applied in the study of the progressive disease progression of AD. Network-based statistical methods were used to extract abnormal subnetworks and locate abnormal brain connections in SCD. SCD patients showed significant changes in the structural connections of the superior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulum, putamen, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and paracentral lobule and were related to cognitive and memory functions (Kim et al., 2019). Further graph theory analysis showed that the global efficiency and local efficiency of the bilateral prefrontal region and left thalamus in SCD were decreased. Although the hub distribution of SCD and NC was similar, the connection strength between SCD hubs was small, and the weakening of rich-club connection strength and local connection strength of SCD was correlated with impaired memory performance (Shu et al., 2018) (Fig. 4A). Rich-clubs are a group of highly interconnected cortical regions, while other regions connected to central regions are called peripheral regions. Although the structure of the rich-club in SCD remained stable, similar damage patterns and reduced connectivity in peripheral regions were also observed in MCI and d-AD patients. This result suggested that SCD connectivity disorder began to spread hierarchically from peripheral regions to rich-club areas along with pathological processes, dynamically reflecting the progression of AD (Yan et al., 2018) (Fig. 4B). It also confirmed the disruption of the topological efficiency of the brain structure connectome in SCD and provided potential biomarkers for the early detection of cognitive impairment. However, some studies believe that the structural network may remain relatively normal in SCD and be destroyed in aMCI (Wang et al., 2016b).\nIn conclusion, the destruction of WM integrity may occur in SCD and further develop in MCI and d-AD. Thus, SCD has an intermediate pattern between NC and MCI. Combined with fMRI, it was found that SCD has the same abnormal characteristics as MCI in structure and function, and WM abnormalities may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD (Wang et al., 2021). Nevertheless, some studies found that there was no significant difference between SCD and NC in various diffusion measures (Kiuchi et al., 2014). The diversity of results in different studies may be due to the different inclusion criteria and definitions of SCD in current studies or the low pathological manifestations of SCD in the ultra-early phase of AD. Combined with the results of most studies, it can be found that neurodegenerative changes have occurred as early as the SCD stage and have potential imaging biomarkers based on DTI.",

    "Objective cognitive impairment and structural disorder in MCI": {
      "text": "MCI, the prodromal stage of AD, has shown significant and objective cognitive decline. MCI can be divided into aMCI and nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) according to the degree of damage to episodic memory. Current research results show that aMCI patients are at high risk of developing AD. There are also studies that divide MCI into early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) according to the delayed recall damage degree of logical memory. Similar to the pattern of WM disruption in SCD, individuals with MCI further spread based on SCD, and not only the increase in brain regions with abnormal structure but also the degree of WM damage was further deepened. MCI fiber abnormalities were also characterized by a broad decrease in FA and an increase in MD, AxD, and RD, as well as disruption of structural connections in parts of the cortex. The structural disorder is between the SCD stage and dementia (Doan et al., 2017).\nDiffusion measures analysis based on TBSS in voxelwise showed that MCI presented SCD similar diffusion abnormalities in the CC, medial temporal lobe, hippocampus and parahippocampal region (Nowrangi et al., 2013;Cardenas et al., 2014;Li et al., 2016) (Fig. 2D), and WM injury patterns in the main fibers, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, UF and corona radiata (Thillainadesan et al., 2012;Li et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2021) (Fig. 2C). Combined with cortical information, Mak et al. did not find a significant increase in MD but found that higher MD in the hippocampus was associated with greater atrophy in the hippocampus and its CA1 region in MCI (Mak et al., 2017b). Many reports have found structural abnormalities in the cingulum and fornix in MCI (Selnes et al., 2012;Hong et al., 2013;Nowrangi et al., 2013;Boespflug et al., 2014). The cingulum is adjacent to the CC and passes through and connects the parahippocampus and temporal lobe regions. However, some studies suggest that the diffusion measures of the hippocampus are more sensitive to the microstructure state of early AD than the cingulum and have a stronger correlation with cognitive performance (Hong et al., 2013), possibly because abnormalities of the hippocampus have been found in SCD. The fornix connects the hippocampus and temporal lobule-related structures and is one of the important regions of interest in AD. Longitudinal studies have also found increased fornix MD in MCI, which may be an early marker of AD progression (Nowrangi et al., 2013). It was also found that the association and projection fibers in the bilateral frontal, parietal and temporal lobes had significant FA decreases and MD increases in aMCI (Liu et al., 2013). Structural differences between aMCI and naMCI have also been reported, and changes in the diffusion measures of some anterior brain regions have a good ability to distinguish between the two categories (Thillainadesan et al., 2012). Similar to SCD, MD is considered to be a better diffusion measure than FA in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (Nowrangi et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2016). However, some studies suggest that AxD and RD, which characterize the axial and radial degree of dispersion, may be more sensitive to potential early AD pathology than MD and FA (Boespflug et al., 2014).\nAtlas-based fiber segmentation found aMCI structural disorders similar to voxelwise, especially in the CC, anterior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract (Huang et al., 2012;Ito et al., 2015;Kumar et al., 2019;Luo et al., 2019) and hippocampal cingulum, fornix and cingulum located in the medial temporal lobe (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012a, 2012b;Srisaikaew et al., 2020). Diffusion measures in the left cingulum and right corticospinal tract were found to be negatively correlated with episodic memory and executive function, respectively (Shao et al., 2019). The fornix, cingulum subregion and UF are three common areas of interest in tractography. The tissue volume fraction, a tract-specific measure of atrophy of MCI, decreased, and RD and AxD of the UF and parahippocampal cingulum increased, which were related to free recall and recognition memory (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012a) (Fig. 3B). In addition, it was also found that microstructural variation in the anterior cingulum was closely related to individual cognitive functions, such as control based on language or symbolic rules and maintenance of spatial rules (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012b). Abnormal fornix diffusion measures may affect the performance of episodic memory in MCI (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012a;Tang et al., 2017a), and the stability of fornix fiber length is important for maintaining executive function (Srisaikaew et al., 2020). Another report found that the mode of anisotropy in MCI increased in the cross-fiber region of the centrum semioval. Further examination by probabilistic tractography found that the increased anisotropy pattern may be due to the crossover of motion-related projective fibers and the upper longitudinal fascicles, highlighting the fiber crossover in the WM pathway in complex areas, which requires further study on pathological cross fibers (Douaud et al., 2011).\nThe damage mode of the topology attribute of the MCI structure network is similar to that of SCD, but it shows a more extensive and more severe anomaly. All aMCI structural networks showed decreased network strength and global efficiency and increased absolute path length, while regional and connectivity defects were found mainly in the frontal lobe and posterior cingulum (Bai et al., 2012). In addition, Fischer et al. used a mixed linear effect model to estimate the relationship between resilience to cognitive decline and higher structural network efficiency. It was found that higher efficiency was associated with higher recovery ability of cognitive decline. Therefore, it was speculated that structural network efficiency may be the basis for maintaining the cognitive ability of elderly individuals with preclinical AD who have not yet developed dementia and to compensate for the additional age-related neural recruitment (Fischer et al., 2021). Some connections in the hippocampus, cingulum, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, precuneus, parahippocampus and some brain regions of the temporal lobe associated with memory function, which remained relatively stable in SCD, were abnormal in MCI, and further extensive disconnection occurred in d-AD. It involves the default mode network, medial visual network, frontal parietal region and other memory subnetworks (Wang et al., 2016b;Rasero et al., 2017). The rich-club structure, which remained relatively stable in SCD, was reduced in MCI by cortical atrophy and connection disruption, and the connectivity between central nodes decreased. The destruction and reduced connectivity of peripheral regions of the network may indicate the destruction of the basic structural framework for complex cognitive functions and thus lead to objective cognitive decline (Yan et al., 2018).\nThe damage pattern of WM structure in MCI was similar to that of SCD, and the medial temporal lobe and CC were further damaged after SCD. In addition, structural disorders of the fornix and cingulate gyrus may affect the objective cognitive performance of patients, such as episodic memory and executive function, leading to the development of the pathological manifestations of objective cognitive decline from subjective cognitive decline. The disconnection of the default mode network may be the structural basis for the beginning of cortical dysfunction, but further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.",

    "Severe cognitive dysfunction in d-AD": {
      "text": "With the further degeneration of the central nervous system, the brain structure and function of d-AD patients are seriously damaged, and various physiological and psychological disorders, such as memory, learning, attention and spatial cognitive function, occur. Studies on DTI brain dispersion properties of d-AD showed that the WM structure of patients was further severely damaged, mainly manifested by the decrease in FA and the continuous increase in MD (Li et al., 2016). Moreover, the structural disorder at this stage was highly correlated with cognitive function, and there was no effective intervention method at present. MCI and d-AD WM destruction patterns are similar. Voxelwise, the CC (Alves et al., 2012;Scrascia et al., 2014;Nishioka et al., 2015), fornix (Nowrangi et al., 2013;Li et al., 2016) and other commissural fibers in d-AD maintained further structural damage after MCI. In addition, the disorder degree of d-AD was significantly higher than that of SCD and MCI in association fibers such as UF (Alves et al., 2012;Madhavan et al., 2016), superior longitudinal fasciculus (Zhang et al., 2009;Li et al., 2016) and projecting fibers such as corona radiata (Li et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2021). Extensive and severe diffusion measure disorders were observed in the hippocampus (Hong et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2016;Mak et al., 2017b;Knight et al., 2019), parahippocampus (Lin et al., 2016;Knight et al., 2019), cingulum (Zhang et al., 2009;Hong et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2016;Li et al., 2018;Knight et al., 2019), precuneus (Cardenas et al., 2014;ODonovan et al., 2014), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Cardenas et al., 2014) and were highly associated with episodic memory. This may be related to the high amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation levels in the d-AD autopsy results combined with cortical atrophy in the medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe detected in other modes, further suggesting structural abnormalities in this region (Teipel et al., 2012;Cardenas et al., 2014;Mak et al., 2017b). Diffusion measure voxelwise changes were also observed in the internal capsule (Liu et al., 2021). Diffusion measures were highly correlated with cognitive function scores (ODonovan et al., 2014;Li et al., 2016Li et al., , 2018)). Some longitudinal studies have shown a significant sequential increase in MD in wide regions in d-AD (Nowrangi et al., 2013;Firbank et al., 2016;Genc et al., 2016). Due to the extensive and sensitive changes in MD, most studies on d-AD believe that MD changes in specific brain regions are good imaging biomarkers (Nowrangi et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2016), and MD changes may be related to brain volume (Firbank et al., 2016). Apathy is one of the most common psychological states of dementia, and it has been found that the impairment of the WM integrity of the CC, internal capsule, anterior cingulum and medial thalamus is related to the apathetic emotion of patients (Ota et al., 2012;Aguera-Ortiz et al., 2017). Interestingly, although no damage was found in the visual cortex of d-AD patients, changes in diffusion measures were detected in the optic nerve, which may explain the visual deficits in d-AD patients (Nishioka et al., 2015).\nA large number of d-AD WM disruption disorder patterns, such as voxelwise patterns, were found based on tractography, and two levels could complement the information. The fiberwise results showed that the diffusion measures of the CC, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, UF, hippocampus and fornix and the morphological abnormalities of WM fibers were the most important factors affecting the pathological cognition of d-AD (Douaud et al., 2011;Ito et al., 2015;Doan et al., 2017;Tang et al., 2017b;Makovac et al., 2018). Studies have shown that the commissural fibers and limbic system are first damaged, and the disorder is further extended to association fibers and projection fibers (Huang et al., 2012). The CC is the main difference region between MCI and d-AD (Douaud et al., 2011), and the structural damage of the genu of the CC could demonstrate it from the side (Tang et al., 2017b). In addition, abnormal diffusion measures of the limbic system were found to be correlated with cortical atrophy, suggesting that the damage to structural connections in the limbic system may be dominated by neuronal injury (Huang et al., 2012). However, another report did not find a correlation between cortical thickness of the limbic system and FA (Lacalle-Aurioles et al., 2016). The fornix is one of the regions of interest in the study of d-AD fibers. Atlas-based extraction and tractography of the fornix showed that the length of the fornix fibers decreased (Tang et al., 2017a), and there were abnormal diffusion measures independent of volume change (Perea et al., 2018) (Fig. 3C). Fornix features could not only distinguish d-AD from NC but also characterize the progressive pathological progression of AD (Oishi et al., 2012). Furthermore, Zhu et al. divided the fornix into the column and body of the fornix and the bilateral fornix crus and stria terminalis according to the template and found that the diffusion measures of the column and body of the fornix varied greatly (Zhu et al., 2015). Longitudinal studies showed that patients with high Tau at baseline showed greater loss of WM integrity at follow-up, and progressive damage to structures in the CC, cingulum, and medial temporal lobe WM was similar to that observed in cross-sectional studies (Weiler et al., 2015). Interestingly, as the cognitive role of the cerebellum has been reported, several cerebellar fibers have also been included in the study of d-AD WM abnormalities. Toniolo et al. performed tractography of the fibers of the cerebellum in d-AD and reconstructed the middle cerebellar peduncle and the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles. The above fibers leading to the cerebellum were also found to have a similar diffusion measure destruction pattern as the brain (Toniolo et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, a structural network of intercortical WM connections can be constructed to explain d-AD pathological abnormalities from connection patterns and topological attributes. By constructing the WM structure network of the subjects and combining it with graph theory analysis, Lo et al. found that the d-AD network showed topological organization abnormalities, such as the shortest path length increase and global efficiency decrease, which proved that d-AD was related to topological organization disorder of the structural network for the first time (Lo et al., 2010). The decline in cognitive and memory function is accompanied by disruption of connections in the precuneus, cingulum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A similar small-world attribute anomaly was found in a subsequent report (Wang et al., 2016a). Overall, the small-world topology attributes of all the networks in d-AD maintain an optimal balance of structural separation and integration. With the pathological progression of AD, on the basis of the structural connectivity interruption of the medial temporal lobe region in MCI, d-AD further shows extensive connectivity degradation in the default mode network, medial visual network, frontal parietal region and striatum subnetwork (Rasero et al., 2017). Affected by the atrophy and disconnection of brain regions, the rich-club attribute of the d-AD structural network also further decreased, and the destruction pattern of the rich-club peripheral region similar to SCD and MCI may be the cause of cognitive decline in patients (Yan et al., 2018). Similarly, in other graph theory parameters, a unique mode of destruction is also found in which the abnormal nodes are remotely connected rather than the center of the network, indicating that the destruction of the d-AD structural network mainly occurs at the peripheral nodes, and the highly connected core is relatively preserved (Daianu et al., 2015). Combined with PET and multiresolution statistical analysis, it was also found that the strength of some structural connections indexed by FA was significantly correlated with amyloid accumulation and cognitive function (Hwang et al., 2019).\nThis section reviews the progressive structural connectivity disorder of AD by DTI. With the continuous development of AD pathology, the patients started from slight structural abnormalities in some brain regions accompanied by chief complaint cognitive decline and gradually developed into extensive structural connectivity disruption and cognitive decline with objective evidence. It further develops into dementia with severe impairment of WM microstructure and cognition, bringing pain and heavy burden to patients and society. In summary, with the progression of AD, extensive connectivity disorders appeared in the medial temporal lobe region, such as the hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, which was highly consistent with the abnormal manifestations in this region reported in autopsy reports. Abnormal changes in the diffusion measures of WM fibers in the CC, fornix and corona radiata may be related to axon injury and demyelination, but further clinical anatomy or higher resolution neuroimaging is needed to prove these findings.",

    "Early assisted recognition of AD using DTI": {
      "text": "In the field of neuroimaging, artificial intelligence algorithms driven by data and their quantitative features have become an important means of pattern recognition and disease diagnosis (Zhou et al., 2021). Disease recognition based on the brain connectome has been used in studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, AD and many other neuropsychiatric disorders (Brown et al., 2012;Khazaee et al., 2015;Plitt et al., 2015). Different from T1 and fMRI modes, dMRI can display the diffusion of water in the brain and retain the structural information of WM fibers. Hence, as preprocessing results, FA and MD diffusion measure maps are often used to perform AD intelligent classification. Furthermore, tractography combined with a prior atlas to form a structural connection map between the cortex can provide additional information for classification at the network level. The early assisted recognition of AD often relies on the mental disorder scales and subjective judgment of doctors. Therefore, using artificial intelligence to classify and predict the progressive pathological process of AD based on imaging biomarkers is essential, objective and efficient. This section reviews the application of early assisted recognition of AD based on DTI and evaluates the potential application value of WM structure disorder in AD.\nTraditional machine learning often adopts manual extraction features, feature selection and dimensionality reduction and inputs meaningful features into the model for progressive pathological stage classification of AD or regression of scale with disease situation. Feature extraction and classification algorithms are the basis of machine learning, and the acquisition of effective feature information plays an important role in accurate classification. The most commonly used DTI features include diffusion measures in voxelwise and networkwise brain structural connections quantified by tractography. Diffusion features and multimodality image features of structural and functional MRI can be used alone, while complementary information of different modalities can be combined, such as morphological information such as cortical thickness and volume of cortex and blood oxygen and brain activation information. Some studies have shown that multimodality features can often achieve better classification results than single modality features (Tang et al., 2016;Yan et al., 2019;Xu et al., 2021). Schouten et al. used TBSS and independent component analysis to process the diffusion measures of the subjects and classified d-AD and NC in voxelwise, and structural connection and graph theory parameters in networkwise. The AUCs of the three levels were between 0.893 and 0.920, 0.896 and between 0.531 and 0.840, respectively. It was found that FA measured through ICA feature clustering could best classify AD (Schouten et al., 2017). Ebadi et al. used a variety of algorithms to classify d-AD, MCI and NC by selecting the graph theory features of the structure network and found that the sensorimotor cortex and primary motor cortex played a positive role in d-AD and MCI classification, respectively, and believed that the sample size should be further expanded in the future to avoid overfitting of classification (Ebadi et al., 2017). Perez-Gonzalez et al. completed the classification of MCI and NC through a random forest classifier combining diffusion measures and multimodality features of the hippocampus, thalamus and amygdala and neuropsychological scale information (Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2021). Similarly, while prior statistics found atrophy and FA reduction in the hippocampus and amygdala, Tang et al. combined diffusion measures and structural features to perform d-AD and NC classification with accuracy up to 94.6 and found that the performance remained stable without volume features (Tang et al., 2016). In addition, AD diagnostic tools and decision support systems based on machine learning can reveal hidden patterns in data. Lella et al. proposed simulating human decision behavior and using diffusion features and soft voting integration methods to classify AD, effectively improving classification performance (Lella et al., 2021).\nLimited by the small sample size of subjects in a single-center database, support vector machine (SVM)in traditional machine learning has become the most commonly used classification algorithm because of its excellent performance on small sample datasets. By using lattice independent component analysis to select voxelwise FA features based on Pearson correlation between lattice independent component analysis residuals and data indicator variables in each voxel, a linear SVM can be used to classify d-AD and NC with high accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (Termenon et al., 2013). Similarly, the accurate classification of MCI and d-AD can be achieved by using the FA of each voxel through TBSS in a voxelwise manner and the average FA value of the region of interest as inputs into SVM (Lee et al., 2013). Furthermore, tractography was used to extract features in fiberwise to obtain the volume and diffusion characteristics of the fiber pathway of WM. SVM could also achieve efficient prediction of MCI to d-AD transformation, and it was found that the volume of the fiber pathway leading to the thalamus made a great contribution to the classification. WM changes in the right cingulum, parahippocampal cingulum terminal region, right frontal cingulum central region, and anterior and posterior regions of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus were the best predictors of MCI conversion to d-AD (Lee et al., 2013;Stone et al., 2021). In addition, multiclassification of NC, SCD, MCI and d-AD is completed by SVM and multimodality complementary information. The classification accuracy of SCD and NC was up to 92.68 (Xu et al., 2021) (Fig. 5A), while that of MCI and d-AD reaches more than 97 due to extensive structural and functional disorders in the whole brain (Yan et al., 2019). In the analysis of common connections and central nodes of multimodal networks, it was found that the cortical to subcutaneous connections of SCD were abnormal (Xu et al., 2021), which was consistent with the damage of peripheral nodes of rich-club structure. Fiber number weighting, mean FA and MD weighting are the most commonly used structural network quantification methods. It has been reported that most of the effective features of classification come from the MD weighting network of the frontal lobe (Huang et al., 2021), which further proves the effectiveness of MD in describing the diffusion characteristics of AD. The default mode network and subcortical structure play an important role in multivariate AD classification, and it was found that with the progression of AD pathology, the subcortical region became increasingly important, and the classification performance of structural connections was better than that of functional networks (Yan et al., 2019).\nAlthough based on the existing feature extraction methods and machine learning model training, the early stages of AD classifiers have achieved good results. However, due to the limitations of machine learning, model training has a high demand for feature validity. Once feature selection problems occur, model performance will be seriously affected, and feature selection diversity is not conducive to unified clinical practice and application. In 2006, Lecun et al. proposed the concept of deep learning and made great progress in the field of image recognition (LeCun et al., 2015). With the continuous improvement of modern computer computing power and big data of the internet, deep learning based on deep neural networks has brought new vitality to the development of artificial intelligence (Zaharchuk et al., 2018). Intelligent medical imaging and signal processing have also become an important part of artificial intelligence. The convolutional neural (Xu et al., 2021). (B)A typical deep learning AD recognition model the VGG16 model which consists of five convolution blocks and a fully connected layer (Kang et al., 2020). Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimers disease; SVM, support vector machine; VGG, Visual Geometry Group network based on transfer learning can effectively identify AD features using DTI and multimodality MRI. Despite only slight structural abnormalities in EMCI, the recognition rate of the classifier still reached 94.2 (Kang et al., 2020) (Fig. 5B). In another report, maps of diffusion measures and gray matter volume were used as inputs for a convolutional neural network, and the classification performance of the MD map was significantly better than that of the gray matter volume map, which may explain the importance of DTI in AD recognition (Marzban et al., 2020). Another advantage of deep learning compared with machine learning lies in its end-to-end training application mode. NC, MCI, d-AD classification decisions can also be completed by directly using DTI and other modality neuroimages input into the deep learning model (Massalimova and Varol, 2021). There is no need for a complex feature extraction process with methodological differences, and the data can be directly input into the deep neural network with different decision modules. The prediction results can be obtained with simple preprocessing (Chen and Xia, 2021;Zhu et al., 2021), which greatly promotes the clinical transformation of neuroimaging in the prediction of early stages of AD.\nDTI provides a potential digital biomarker for the preclinical assisted recognition and prediction of AD. The voxelwise diffusion measures and the features of the WM structural network derived from it were used. MCI, d-AD and cognition in the normal aging population can be classified with high accuracy. Multimodal neural imaging complementary information has a positive effect on the classification model (Bron et al., 2017). Evidence of abnormal WM is provided, and the application value of DTI biomarkers is illustrated with advanced artificial intelligence technology. However, the poor classification effect of SCD may be due to the absence of widespread disorder and significantly abnormal changes in WM and diffusion degree of subjects in the ultra-early phase of AD, and no problems in objective cognitive and memory ability. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the central nervous mechanism abnormalities in SCD and gradually improve the objective resolution ability.",

    "Limitations and perspectives": {
      "text": "Many advances have been made in the study of the central nervous system mechanism of AD using DTI, and many potential imaging biomarkers have been established. Although DTI has provided much information about AD structural connectome abnormalities, there are still many limitations in the current study that hinder further understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying AD degeneration. This section summarizes the shortcomings of current DTI-based AD research and puts forward the prospect of future research content.\nFirst, most of the current research data are based on different recruitment centers and image acquisition. There may be differences between the scanning equipment, relevant scanning parameters and inclusion criteria, and racial and demographic information of the subjects. Abnormal WM results could be common in some brain regions but are also center specific. In addition, even if the subjects recruited for a single study were matched in age and gender, individual differences may serve as confounding factors to influence the results due to the potential neuropsychiatric diseases and drug use associated with AD. It is also necessary to pay attention to methodological issues in DTI analysis, such as head motion correction (Aoki et al., 2018) and image registration (Keihaninejad et al., 2013). A unified data pipeline process may improve the explicability of research results. Because the change in DTI diffusion measures is related to a variety of physiological reasons, such as fiber consistency, density, size and myelin sheath abnormality, the specific reasons for their changes related to AD need further study and discussion. Therefore, on the one hand, future research should include improving the large AD neuroimaging database, such as ADNI (Weiner et al., 2010(Weiner et al., , 2017;;Keihaninejad et al., 2013) and OASIS (Marcus et al., 2007(Marcus et al., , 2010)), drawing lessons from a multicenter image data fitting method to limit research objects in age, sex, medical history (drug use, behavior therapy, etc.) and constantly expanding the sample capacity.\nOn the other hand, a strict DTI pipeline process should be designed, combined with the existing advanced software packages, such as FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012), MRtrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019), PANDA (Cui et al., 2013), and Diffusionkit (Xie et al., 2016), to standardize the data process and continuously improve the credibility of research results.\nDifferences between patients in core symptoms, environmental factors, genetic risk, brain function and structure may lead to different manifestations of cognitive dysfunction. Some neuropsychiatric scales are often used to conduct preliminary screening for individuals at risk. However, as a result of pathological heterogeneity, the MCI stage is divided into various types, such as early and late MCI according to the delayed recall damage degree of logical memory and amnestic MCI and naMCI according to the damage degree of episodic memory, which may have an impact on the results with the clinical manifestations of different divisions of MCI subtypes. In addition, as SCD is the ultra-early phase of AD, different diagnostic criteria and assessment strategies may be an important factor leading to the heterogeneous results. Although SCD-I (Jessen et al., 2014) proposed a unified inclusion standard for SCD, it has not been widely used. Future studies could start with case-control strategies and use more consistent approaches to reflect the underlying neurological damage of the disease. The similarities and differences of different disease subtypes should be further studied, and the development of disease subtype recognition technology based on DTI will be promoted by using data-driven methods.\nDTI, as a single modality of MRI, has a good ability to describe WM fibers with its degree of diffusion. However, there are few explanations for gray matter atrophy, cortical variation and large-scale brain functional network activation. Other modality neuroimaging, such as functional, structural and arterial spin label perfusion MRI, can provide other information, and the complementary results of each modality can better understand the neural mechanism of AD (Liang et al., 2021;Song et al., 2021). It has been reported that fMRI signals appear in WM (Li et al., 2019a;Wang et al., 2022), indicating that in addition to the microstructural characteristics of WM, the functional characteristics of WM are also worth studying. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen multimodality neuroimaging fusion in the study of AD neural mechanisms in the future and use complementary information from each modality to reveal whether there is an atypical coupling relationship between structural and functional connections and its influence on the progressive pathology of AD. In addition, although the current intelligent assisted recognition based on DTI identifies good results in MCI and d-AD, in SCD and various subtypes of MCI, the diagnostic accuracy is not satisfactory, and it is still in the laboratory rather than in clinics. Combined with symptoms, cognitive function, and structural and functional connections to explore the intelligent recognition of AD, further understanding of the pathogenesis of AD through complementary modality information will facilitate the accurate recognition and treatment of AD.\nOwing to the limitations of modeling methods, although DTI can quickly describe Gaussian dispersion properties in the brain, it has shortcomings in simulating cross fibers and partial volume effects. More advanced diffusion technologies and models are emerging and being applied to AD research. Fiber reconstruction based on diffusion kurtosis imaging (Falangola et al., 2013;Yuan et al., 2016;Cheng et al., 2018;Xue et al., 2019;Tu et al., 2021), high angular resolution diffusion imaging and constrained spherical deconvolution algorithms (Christiansen et al., 2016;Mito et al., 2020) can provide a more accurate method to depict real complex fiber structures because they can estimate multiple fiber directions in a single voxel. Biophysical tissue models such as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) can classify tissues within voxels into intracellular and extracellular regions and may have greater potential in capturing gray and white matter cell and synaptic microstructures (Nazeri et al., 2020). Currently, through DTI and its complementary NODDI, it is found that tau deposition in the cerebral cortex is related to lower axon accumulation density and greater free diffusion degree (Wen et al., 2021). Free water elimination was used to correct the diffusion properties of fibers by other brain fluids in a voxelwise manner, effectively improving the accuracy of AD studies based on DTI (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012c;Hoy et al., 2017;Du et al., 2020;Archer et al., 2021;Bergamino et al., 2021). In addition, referring to the definition of voxels, Raffelt et al. proposed the imaging concept of neural fibers called fixels (Raffelt et al., 2015(Raffelt et al., , 2017;;Dhollander et al., 2021), which were successfully applied in the study of WM abnormalities in AD. Significant changes in WM were found in specific fiber pathways associated with the nodes of the default mode network in both micro-and macrostructures, especially in the fiber density and cross-section of the cingulum in MCI (Mito et al., 2018). The fiber density of the splenium of the CC, limbic tracts, cingulum bundles, and posterior thalamic radiation was significantly decreased in early-onset AD (Luo et al., 2021). The establishment of animal AD models provides an opportunity for intervention based on neural mechanisms (Brueggen et al., 2019). With future advances in computing and dMRI methodology, the application of more advanced dMRI methods will provide a more detailed explanation of the neural mechanism and pathology of AD.\nFinally, most AD WM abnormality studies based on DTI are crosssectional studies comparing imaging characteristics such as diffusion measures and structural connections at each stage of AD with normal controls. This experimental design largely misses individual differences and longitudinal progression in the progressive progression of AD. Longitudinal studies such as follow-up scanning can more effectively assess the pathologic trajectory of AD and help to discover the causal relationship between imaging biomarkers and neurodegeneration. Massive AD databases and clinical study cohorts, such as ADNI, OASIS, DELCODE (Jessen et al., 2018) and SILCODE (Li et al., 2019b), provide datasets for longitudinal studies on the pathological progression of AD and help to explore the longitudinal development trajectory of different imaging biomarkers of AD. In the future, longitudinal studies to identify individual specific structural connectivity biomarkers for AD will also be the focus of DTI-based studies of AD WM abnormalities and will further identify early biomarkers for the transformation prediction of SCD and MCI individuals into d-AD.\nDespite the above limitations, the key conclusions of WM abnormalities in AD based on DTI are reviewed, and we describe the current common imaging biomarkers and digital characteristics in AD and different levels of DTI. Furthermore, intelligent diagnosis classification methods using diffusion characteristics are summarized. We also discuss the existing problems and forecast future development trends.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "Based on voxelwise, fiberwise, and networkwise DTI methods, we summarized the progressive neurodegenerative cognitive decline and WM structure disorder from patients who complained of SCD. Cognitive memory appeared to be an objective obstacle in MCI, and the final cognitive function exhibited obvious symptoms in d-AD. DTI used the symmetric positive definite tensor field derived from DWI to characterize the ellipsoid model of brain tissue diffusion degree and further fitted diffusion measures such as FA and MD to quantify the diffusion situation and microstructural integrity of WM fibers. With the continuous development of AD pathology, patients showed extensive FA decrease and MD increase in the brain compared with the normal cognitive aging population, and this situation deepens with the progress of SCD, MCI, and d-AD. Related structural abnormalities can be detected in the CC, hippocampus, cingulum and other medial temporal lobe regions at the SCD stage and further changes with the pathological process. The fornix is the connection between the hippocampus and other areas of the temporal lobe, and its abnormal diffusion measures have been reported intensively in MCI and d-AD, which may be a distinguishing biomarker of SCD and MCI. Different phases of structural connection interruption and small-world attribute abnormalities were also observed in AD, and the rich-club attribute was significantly reduced, revealing the disorder of AD brain network topology. In addition, although preliminary results have been achieved in the intelligent assisted recognition and prediction of imaging biomarkers for AD based on DTI characteristics, there is still a long way to go for clinical application with an efficient recognition model. Future studies require more appropriate large sample datasets with more objective and rigorous expert consensus, as well as advanced dMRI techniques and analytical frameworks to validate the current results and explore the digital neurobiological features and evidence of WM abnormalities in AD based on dMRI.",

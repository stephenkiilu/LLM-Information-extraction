    "abstract": "Tractography is a procedure that can track and demonstrate the 3D neural tracts of the white matter of the brain. The images of the brain are obtained by analyzing the diffusion tensor, identification of which can provide the anatomical connections of the brain. Studying these connections is integral to the understanding of the brain function. Specifically, the uncinate fasciculus (UF), which is the white matter in the human brain, is said to be related to cognitive function. The UF tractography is calculated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameter. Studies have shown that the DTI parameter of dementia patients is lower than that of healthy individuals. It is also suggested that the DTI parameter of healthy individuals decreases with age. In addition, the WMS-R score, which is indicative of general memory, verbal memory and other cognitive functions, of the elderly are lower than of the young. However, there is no report yet that has holistically investigated DTI parameter and the memory functions. Thus, in this research, we have calculated the correlation coefficient between the DTI parameter of UF and WMS-R score. Our result shows that the correlation coefficient of diffusivity of the fiber direction and visual memory of a left UF is -0.226 at the maximum. Correlation between DTI measurement and memory performance suggests the relationships between the UF and function in memory tasks lateralization. Our finding matches previous reports on the correlation between FA in the left, or L1 in the right UF, and performance on visual memory.",

    "I. INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a major white matter tract connecting the anterior temporal and frontal lobes 1. It is shaped like a curved dumbbell and links the three anterior temporal convolutions and the amygdala with the gyrus rectus, medial retro orbital cortex, and subcallosal area 2. The UF is important for the formation and retrieval of episodic memories 3,4.\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) measures the molecular motion of water in tissue in six or more directions, and characterizes the magnitude and direction of diffusion in every single voxel. Thus, it is used to reveal the microstructure of white matter 567. The integrated white matter tracts measured by DTI are related to individual differences in performance across a wide range of cognitive functions.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation of the degree of DTI parameters with changed memory scores.

    "MRI and DTI data acquisition and processing": {
      "text": "MR-images are acquired using a 1.5T whole body MR scanner (Toshiba Medical Systems Inc). And then, DTI acquisitions are taken from the subjects. The DTI acquisition consists of axial 2D echo planar imaging (2D EPI) diffusion-weighted sequence with TRTE  12000130 ms, FOV  24 cm, matrix 128  128, 3-mm contiguous slices without gap, two b values  0 and 1000 smm 2 , done in six directions.\nThe diffusion tensor D is calculated using equation (1),\nwhere each set of diffusion-weighted images is utilized.\nb S is the measured MR signal for a given b value, 0 S is the MR signal for b  0, b value is the diffusion gradient factor along each direction (smm 2 ), the diffusion tensor D describes the molecular mobility and correlation towards these directions. The diffusion tensor D can be diagonalized to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues ( ). The eigenvectors describe the major diffusion directions and the eigenvalues are related to their diffusivities. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be obtained from the trace of\n. Parametric maps of the ADC and fractional anisotropy (FA) are obtained using these eigenvalues. FA is a scalar value that describes the shape of the diffusion within a given voxel, with a range from 0 to 1. Parametric maps for the axial or parallel, L1  1  , and\n,diffusivities are also defined.",

    "Tractography analysis": {
      "text": "DTI Studio software 8 based on the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm is used for white matter fiber tracking. Diffusion tensor tractography using multiple regions-of-interest (ROI) are also used to trace the UF bilaterally 910111213. The tracking method uses fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold of 0.15, and angle threshold of 60 degrees. These thresholds are similar to previous publications 14,15.\nThe UF superior and inferior segments traversing the coronal plane is determined as an anatomical landmark as shown in Fig. 1A, ROI. A Boolean OR operation on one region combined with an AND operation on the other are chosen to construct the UF on each side. On the UF fiber tract, its traced volume and corresponding DTI parameters such as FA, ADC, L1 and LT are recorded in 3D as shown in Fig. 1B.",

    "III. RESULTS": {
      "text": "Table 1 shows that the mean FA, ADC, L1 and LT in the left UF are higher than in the right UF. MN denotes the mean values and SD represents standard deviations. Mean ADC in the left UF is significantly higher than in the right UF (p0.05). Mean L1 in the left is also significantly higher in the right (p  0.01). Left and right UF differences are comparable with previous studies 14,16,17.\nThe correlations with DTI measures in the UF are summarized in Table 2 correlation in almost all memory indices than in the right UF except in the delayed recall. On the other, ADC, L1 and LT have higher correlations in the right than in the left UF. In Fig. 2 and3, the representative correlation between FA in the left UF tract, L1 in the right UF, and visual memory score are shown. Significant correlations are not found between DTI measurements and memory scores. IV. DISCUSSION\nIn this study, FA is greater in the left than the right UF with almost symmetrical tract volume. Some studies reported that a left greater than right asymmetry in UF FA 18, but other found that the right UF had higher FA 19. These discrepancies came from the differences in both the image acquisition and analysis method.\nThe UF connects the inferior frontal, and anterior and mesial temporal lobes 2. Mesial temporal and frontal structures are associated with encoding and retrieval of memories. Using fMRI in healthy controls, episodic memory is found to be associated with both mesial temporal and frontal lobe activation 20,21. The left medial temporal structures are activated by encoding verbal information, the right is activated by encoding less verbalizable stimuli such as patterns, and both are activated by encoding intermediate verbalizable stimuli such as faces and scenes 21,22. The lateralization of memory performance regarding verbal material appears stronger in the left.\nCorrelation between DTI measures and memory performance suggests the relationship between the UF and function in memory tasks lateralization. In the dominant hemisphere, strong relationships between function and structure have been found in the left hemisphere for both language and memory in a DTI and fMRI studies 23. Subjects with more lateralized functional activation are likely to have more highly lateralized DTI values. This correlation between lateralized memory performance and DTI abnormalities has also been observed in diseases. Functions across neuropsychological measures and the relationship between memory performance and DTI measures are found in schizophrenia patients. Lower FA in the right UF is correlated with reduced performance on measures of visual attention 18. Left UF measurements are also correlated with lower performance on measures of verbal and visual memory 24. Our finding matches these previous reports on the correlation between FA in the left, or L1 in the right UF, and performance on visual memory.\nIn this study, neuropsychological measures are available only for the healthy controls. Correlation between memory performance and UF diffusion measures in patients should be compared. However, the correlations between memory performance and integrity of the UF can be found particularly in the dominant hemisphere. Some studies show a right greater than left asymmetry in the stem and the inferior (temporal) part of the UF 19,25 and a left greater than right asymmetry in the frontal UF. Further study should investigate these two parts of the UF separately.",

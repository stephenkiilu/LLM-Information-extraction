    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 5 million Americans and placing enormous strain on the US health care system. It is known that AD neuropathology is present years before cognitive symptoms associated with clinical AD (Bennett, et al., 2006, Morris, et al., 1996). Motivated by this knowledge and an impending rise in cases of AD, clinical diagnostic criteria have recently been revised to emphasize the need for biomarkers that can detect preclinical stages of AD (McKhann, et al., 2011, Sperling, et al., 2011). These revised diagnostic criteria focus primarily on ADrelated protein biomarkers such as amyloid-beta and tau in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain imaging indices of gray matter (GM) structure and metabolism.\nThere has been relatively less focus on the potential for white matter (WM) integrity biomarkers in preclinical AD. However, increasing evidence suggests pathological alterations to WM microstructural integrity in AD. For example, partial loss of myelin sheaths, axons, and oligodendroglial cells has been reported in patients with AD (Brun and Englund, 1986, Englund, 1998, Ihara, et al., 2010). Convergent evidence of WM integrity disruption in AD has been demonstrated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an in vivo method for characterizing the microstructural properties of WM by measuring the rate and direction of diffusion of water molecules trapped in neural tissue (Basser, et al., 2000, Beaulieu, 2002, Le Bihan, 2003, Moseley, 2002). A body of data from DTI studies has demonstrated that reduced WM integrity is evident in AD and its typical prodromal state of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (reviewed in Stebbins and Murphy, 2009).\nMore recently, WM integrity reductions have been observed in multiple DTI studies of cognitively normal (CN) individuals at high AD-risk based on genetics andor family history (reviewed in Gold, et al., 2012). However, it remains unclear if lower WM integrity in CN older adults is associated with CSF measures of AD pathology such as Aβ 42 or p-Tau 181 . Accumulating evidence suggests a potential link between WM integrity and these CSF measures of AD pathology. For example, Aβ deposits have been shown to be cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro (Xu, et al., 2001) and increased levels of Aβ peptides have been associated with reduced levels of myelin biochemical markers at autopsy in patients with AD (Roher, et al., 2002). The aggregation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau may also affect WM microstructure given that tau binds to and stabilizes microtubules, which are essential for structural integrity and axonal transport (Shahani and Brandt, 2002).\nHere we sought to determine if lower WM integrity in CN individuals is associated with CSF markers of AD pathology. CSF biomarkers of AD are thought to precede neuroimaging alterations by several years (Jack, et al., 2010). Thus, to maximize power to detect subtle CSF-DTI correlations in CN individuals, our primary analyses employed an ROI approach (although additional voxelwise analyses were also performed) focusing on two limbic tracts known to be affected in early stages of AD: the fornix and cingulum. Reduced WM integrity in the fornix has been found in individuals with familial autosomal dominantly inherited forms of AD (Ringman, et al., 2007) and in individuals at high genetic risk for sporadic AD (Gold, et al., 2010). Reduced WM integrity in the cingulum has been observed in multiple studies of individuals at high genetic andor familial risk for sporadic AD (Bendlin, et al., 2010, Heise, et al., 2011, Persson, et al., 2006, Smith, et al., 2010).\nThe fornix and cingulum have direct connections with GM structures known to undergo neurodegenerative changes early in the course of AD. The fornix is the principal efferent tract of the hippocampus, and the cingulum is one of the main tracts associated with the entorhinal cortex (ERC). The volume of the hippocampus and ERC are reduced in individuals with aMCI and AD (Convit, et al., 1997, Jack, et al., 1997) and in CN individuals destined for future aMCI or AD (Apostolova, et al., 2010, Dickerson and Wolk, 2012, Martin, et al., 2010). Thus, we controlled for the volume of these GM structures in our WM integrity-CSF analyses. In addition, fornix WM integrity analyses controlled for fornix volume to determine if DTI measures reveal unique information not captured by macrostructural measures of this tract.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "Twenty CN older adults (8 male, 12 female) participated in this study. Participants were recruited from an existing cohort of cognitive normal volunteers who undergo annual collection of demographic, health, and neuropsychologic data and blood samples as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of aging (Schmitt, et al., 2012). Exclusionary criteria applied at intake for the longitudinal study are history of substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, major psychiatric illness, medical illnesses that are unstable (requiring other than routine follow-up and medical management) andor have an effect on the central nervous system (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinsonism, or other neurologic disease). Continued diagnosis of cognitive normality by the UK-ADC clinical core was based on a uniform set of clinical assessment procedures common to United States ADCs described in detail elsewhere (Morris et al., 2006). This includes collection of the Uniform Data Set (UDS), collected from all ADC subjects and shared with the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC) in Seattle, Washington, under an agreement with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimers Centers Program. Neuropsychological test results from the current UDS battery (Weintraub, et al., 2009) Participants in the present study were those who agreed to lumbar puncture as part of a pilot study that seeks to explore the relationship between CSF and imaging markers of AD. Exclusion criteria for the present MRI-CSF study beyond those applied for entry into our longitudinal cohort were claustrophobia, pacemakers, or the presence of metal fragments andor metallic implants contraindicated for MRI. Characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant under an approved University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board protocol.",

    "DTI analysis": {
      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were processed and analyzed using FSLs FMRIB software library (FSL v4.1.5). Raw images were pre-processed to correct for motion and residual eddy current distortion using a 12-parameter affine alignment to the corresponding b0 image via FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT: http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk fsl). Brain masks were then generated from each b0 image using FMRIBs brain extraction tool (BET v2.1) to exclude non-brain voxels from further consideration (Smith, et al., 2006). Next, FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT v2.0) was used to fit the diffusion tensor and calculate eigenvalues, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA) and radial diffusivity (DR).\nRegistration of FA images into MNI152 space and subsequent voxelwise analyses followed a series of procedures known as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics TBSS v1.2; (Smith et al., 2006) http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsltbss, as described in detail in our previous work (Johnson, et al., 2012). Briefly, the first step in this process was to remove likely outliers from the fitted tensor data by eroding brain edge artifacts and zeroing the end slices. Second, all subjects FA images were aligned to a target (the one to which the least amount of warping is required) using a nonlinear registration approach based on free-form deformations and B-Splines (Rueckert et al., 1999). FA datasets were then affine registered and resampled to 1  1  1 mm MNI152 space. The exact transformations derived from the FA maps were then applied to the other diffusivity maps (MDDRDA) for matched processing of all image volumes. All subsequent processing was carried out in MNI space.\nAll MNI-transformed FA images were then averaged to generate a mean FA image that was used to create a common WM tract skeleton. This skeleton was then thresholded at an FA value of 0.2 to minimize partial voluming effects after warping across subjects. Each participants aligned FA image was subsequently projected onto the FA skeleton to account for residual misalignments between participants after the initial nonlinear registration. Each subjects MD, DA and DR maps in MNI space were then projected onto the common tract skeleton, using the pipeline for non-FA data provided by TBSS, which employs the projection vectors from each individuals FA-to-skeleton transformation (Smith et al., 2006).\nA priori ROI analyses-The motivation for an initial a priori ROI analysis was twofold. First, we expected subtle effects in CN older adults and thus attempted to maximize power by centering our ROIs around WM regions previously linked with high AD-risk. Second, we sought to replicate effects in specific ROIs in MNI space on a different group of CN older adults, toward a long-term goal of the development of potential biomarkers of AD. Two a priori ROIs were selected for correlations with CSF analytes. The WM ROIs were portions of the left fornix and left cingulum (Figure 1), and were centered around peak MNI coordinates of WM integrity reductions in CN individuals at high AD-risk in our previous study (Gold, et al., 2010). The ROIs were situated within a ventro-caudal portion of the fornix (in the crus region; MNI coordinates: -27 -25 -4) and a ventro-caudal portion of the cingulum (MNI coordinates: -22 -27 -18). The ROI masks were 3 mm isotropic cubes surrounding these peak coordinates. Each ROI was masked with the mean FA skeleton in order to minimize partial voluming. The means from these clusters (e.g., mean FA) were extracted from each participant using FSLs utility fslmeants.",

Each participants T1 image was then registered to the MNI T1 template using FSLs non-linear registration tool (FNIRT). Using the inverse transformation matrix and inverse non-linear warping parameters, the template space left fornix mask was then registered back to each participants native space, effectively aligning it with their native space T1 image. T1 images were then segmented into GM, WM and CSF compartments and participants fornix ROI masks were applied to their segmented WM images. Left fornix volumes were calculated based on the total number of voxels labeled as WM within each participants native space left fornix ROI (1 voxel  1mm 3 ).

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "All ROI analyses were conducted in SPSS 21.0 (Chicago, IL). Partial Pearson correlations were run controlling for age, sex and years of education. Initial ROI analyses focused on potential relationships between FA (the most general DTI measure of WM integrity) in each ROI and CSF protein levels. To limit the number of comparisons, relationships between more specific component diffusivity measures (DRDAMD) and CSF analytes were only explored in the presence of significant FA-CSF relationships. Partial correlations were also performed between CSF protein levels and the structural volumetric ROI data. Because we had no a priori hypotheses about laterality for the volumetric analyses, these correlations were run on the averaged normalized volumes in each ROI (e.g., the average of left and right hippocampus) and CSF protein level (e.g., Aβ 42 ), controlling for age, sex and education. There were two ROIs for each of the WM integrity (left fornix and left cingulum) and the GM volumetric (averaged left-right hippocampus and averaged left-right ERC) analyses. Thus, a family-wise significance level of P  0.025 (i.e. 0.052) was adopted for each of the WM integrity and volumetric ROI analyses.\nWe further sought to determine the potential influence of GM and WM volume in relevant MTL structures on significant WM-CSF relationships. This was explored by controlling for normalized volume of relevant GM or WM structures in the case of significant DTI-CSF partial correlations (i.e., adding left hippocampus volume or left fornix volume to the significant left fornix WM integrity -CSF models). Finally, the functional relevance of significant DTI-CSF associations was explored through partial correlations between FA in that ROI and two UDS cognitive test scores of high relevance to preclinical AD states (Logical Memory Delayed and Digit Symbol) (Blacker, et al., 2007, Dickerson, et al., 2007), as well as a control measure of psychomotor speed (Trails A). To limit the number of comparisons, relationships between other more specific component diffusivity measures (DRDAMD) and these cognitive tests were only explored in the presence of significant FA-cognitive score relationships.\nTo supplement significant correlational findings in the fornix ROI, follow-up group comparisons were run by classifying individuals into high risk and low risk groups for preclinical AD based CSF Aβ 42 values. The cut-point values used were those established by Sjogren M et al. (2001) for INNOTEST ELISA kits with 21F12 antibody for capture and 3D6 (biotinylated) antibody for detection of Aβ 42 . These authors established a CSF Aβ 42 value of  500 ngL as cut-point for CN adults. Using this cut-point, 9 out of 20 of our participants were classified as high risk for preclinical AD.\nFollowing ROI analyses, a voxelwise analysis was run in FSL to identify additional potential relationships between CSF measures and WM integrity in regions other than our ROIs. To limit the number of comparisons, we focused on the measures showing the most robust effects in our ROI analyses: FA and the Aβ 42 p-Tau 181 ratio. The voxelwise analysis used linear regression with FA as the dependent variable, Aβ 42 p-Tau 181 ratio as the independent variable of interest, and age, sex and education as covariates of no interest. A voxelwise permutation nonparametric test (using 5000 permutations) was employed using FSLs threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). We expected DTI-CSF correlations to be subtle in our sample of CN participants. Thus, results were thresholded at P  0.001 (uncorrected) and cluster size of  10 voxels.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We observed a positive correlation between CSF measures of Aβ (Aβ 42 and Aβ 42 p-Tau 181 ) and cerebral WM integrity in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. In the crus region of the left fornix, the relationship between CSF measures of Aβ and WM microstructural integrity persisted after controlling for both hippocampal volume and fornix volume. Our results suggest that in vivo WM integrity measures hold promise as non-invasive markers of preclinical AD.\nOur ROI results link WM integrity in the fornix with CSF measures of amyloid beta (Aβ 42 and Aβ 42 p-Tau 181 ) in CN older adults. In contrast, no relationship was observed between WM integrity in our fornix ROI and CSF levels of p-Tau 181 . The predominant AD biomarker time course model holds that the accumulation of Aβ, as measured by CSF Aβ 42 or amyloid imaging, is a key precipitating event in the pathophysiological cascade leading to tau-mediated neuronal injury, cerebral atrophy and memory impairment (Jack, et al., 2010). A more recent review maintains the view of Aβ as a likely initiator in sporadic AD, but suggests that tau pathologies may arise independently in some cases and remain beneath current in vivo CSF detection thresholds for longer than Aβ (Jack et al., 2013).\nIn either case, the present link between WM integrity in the fornix and measures of CSF Aβ 42 in CN older adults suggests that microstructural fornix damage may be an early event in the course of AD. As a further test of this possibility, we compared FA values in our fornix ROI between individuals classified according to CSF Aβ 42 values reflecting the likelihood of having preclinical AD according to values established by Sjogren et al. (2001). These authors used a rank-based method to estimate the lower reference limit for CSF Aβ 42 in CN adults. Using the cut-point of 500 ngL established by these authors to classify our participants, we found lower WM integrity in our fornix ROI in the group likely to have preclinical AD compared to the group unlikely to have preclinical AD.\nOur results are the first to our knowledge to link measures of WM integrity and CSF collected at the same time in CN older adults. A recent study reported correlations between measures of total tau (T-Tau and T-TauAβ 42 ) and DTI measures collected approximately 3.5 years later in CN older adults (Bendlin, et al., 2012). These authors found that measures of CSF tau were correlated with DTI measures across much of the brains WM, while CSF Aβ 42 was correlated with FA in the medial frontal gyrus. Although the relationship we observed between measures of CSF Aβ 42 and WM integrity in the fornix of CN older adults is novel, it appears to be broadly consistent with recent results reporting a similar relationship using PiB amyloid imaging (Chao, et al., 2013). These authors reported that PiB positive individuals (most of whom had aMCI) had lower WM integrity in the fornix (and splenium) than PiB-negative individuals (most of whom were CN).\nThe fornix is a key efferent tract of the hippocampus, connecting it with subcortical structures in the diencephalon and basal frontal lobes. However, the CSF-WM integrity relationship we observed in the fornix does not appear to be a secondary consequence of AD-related hippocampal atrophy (i.e., Wallerian degeneration) because the inclusion of hippocampal volume as an additional nuisance covariate did not affect the significance of our correlations between measures of CSF Aβ 42 and WM integrity in the fornix. These results are consistent with recent findings suggesting that alterations in the fornix are apparent in early stages of AD and may be independent from GM alterations (Gold et al., 2010;Oishi et al., 2012;Fletcher et al., 2013;Sachdev et al., 2013;Zhuang et al., 2013). The finding that the relationship between CSF Aβ 42 and WM integrity in the crus region persisted after controlling for fornix volume suggests that DTI may provide information about preclinical stages of AD that is not captured by traditional neuroimaging measures of WM macrostructure.\nResults from our exploratory voxelwise analyses indicated a positive correlation between Aβ 42 p-Tau 181 and FA in bilateral portions of the fornix, the SLF, and the IFOF, as well as in the corpus callosum, and the left ILF. These voxelwise correlations are considered preliminary because only the right SLF survived correction for multiple comparisons. It should also be noted that the voxelwise effects were in a more rostral portion of the fornix (the body) than that observed in our ROI analyses (the crus). Multiple portions of the fornix are likely to be affected in preclinical AD. The crus is a thinner portion of the fornix than the body and thus less likely to meet significance and cluster thresholds required for voxelwise analyses. Nevertheless, the present link between CSF markers of AD and WM integrity in the fornix ROI is notable in that it represents a replication of a similar effect in this region observed in a different group of CN older adults in our previous work. Replication is acknowledged as a key step in the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of preclinical AD (Sperling, et al., 2011;Dickerson et al., 2012).\nWe note several caveats of the present study. First, our relatively small sample size may have limited the power to identify the full complement of WM patterns associated with CSF measures of Aβ in CN individuals. Another caveat is that DTI-based WM integrity effects in the fornix reported here and elsewhere may suffer from free water contamination due to the proximity of this tract to ventricular spaces. Future research should be directed toward answering this issue. It should also be acknowledged that our cross-sectional design yielded correlational results that cannot distinguish between the possibilities that Aβ accumulation could lead to myelin breakdown (Xu, et al., 2001) or that myelin breakdown could lead to AD pathogenesis (Bartzokis, 2011). Future longitudinal research may be able to distinguish between these possibilities by obtaining repeat-measure scans and lumbar punctures and determining which measures decline rate better predicts the other.\nAdditional caveats should also be noted. First, our analyses focused initially on FA, with analyses of component diffusivities only being conducted in the presence of significant FA-CSF relationships. The FA-first analysis stream was selected because FA is considered a general measure of WM integrity and served to limit the number of comparisons conducted. However, component diffusivity effects have sometimes been reported as more prominent than FA effects (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Fletcher et al., 2013) and our approach may have missed some component diffusivity effects occurring in the absence of FA effects. Another caveat is that we did not compute total tau and were thus unable to assess possible relationships between levels of CSF protein and WM integrity in CN older adults. Finally, future longitudinal studies will be required to assess relationships between rates of change in WM integrity, CSF levels and cognition.\nIn summary, our results suggest a link between measures of cerebral WM integrity and CSF markers of AD pathology in CN older adults. In particular, our findings suggest that presumed early degenerative changes affecting the fornix in CN older adults may be independent of those affecting the hippocampus and cannot be accounted for by fornix volume. Future DTI studies with larger sample sizes hold promise for identifying potential WM integrity biomarkers of AD in its earliest stages. Results of voxelwise regression analysis.

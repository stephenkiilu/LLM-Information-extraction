    "abstract": "Object: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), a natural extension of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can characterize non-Gaussian diffusion in the brain. We investigated the capability of DKI parameters for detecting microstructural changes in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) and sought to determine whether these DKI parameters could serve as imaging biomarkers to indicate the severity of cognitive deficiency. Materials and Methods: DKI was performed on 18 AD patients and 12 MCI patients. Fractional anisotropy, kurtosis and diffusivity parameters in the temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital lobes were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test. The correlations between regional DKI parameters and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score were tested using Pearsons correlation. Results: In ADs, significantly increased diffusivity and decreased kurtosis parameters were observed in both the GM and WM of the parietal and occipital lobes as compared to MCIs. Significantly decreased fractional anisotropy was also observed in the WM of these lobes in ADs. With the exception of fractional anisotropy and radial kurtosis, all the five other DKI parameters exhibited significant correlations with MMSE score in both GM and WM. Conclusion: Bearing additional information, the DKI model can provide sensitive imaging biomarkers for assessing the severity of cognitive deficiency in reference to MMSE score and potentially improve early detection and progression monitoring of AD based on characterizing microstructures in both the WM and especially the GM.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been recognized as a transitional phase between normal health and Alzheimers disease (AD). Every year, 10-15 of MCI patients progress to AD. With medications that delay progression in clinical trials, the early detection of AD and the monitoring of MCI progression are of paramount importance. Microstructural changes in cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) have been suggested to account for the pathologic mechanisms of MCI and AD. Noninvasive imaging techniques focusing on affected regions will therefore be of great help, although sensitive and specific biomarkers indicative of microstructural alterations, especially in the GM, are still lacking.\nDiffusional tensor imaging (DTI) has long been used to detect microstructural changes in cerebral WM. Two major quantitative measurements, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, have been demonstrated to be capable of revealing WM microstructural abnormalities in AD 123456789. A few studies have compared DTI measurements between AD and MCI, but the results were inconsistent. While some studies identified significant differences in the splenium of the corpus callosum or posterior cingulated 3456, others observed no difference 1,2,7. Studies seeking to identify the association between cognitive evaluation scores from mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and DTI parameters have also reported controversial results. Some studies 10,11 reported certain significant correlations, whereas others 7,12 found none. Moreover, DTI also has intrinsic drawbacks, as it only reflects a fraction of diffusion characteristics of water molecules and assumes this diffusion to be Gaussian, which, on the contrary, is generally non-Gaussian.\nThe model of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a natural extension of DTI and is able to delineate non-Gaussian diffusion aroused by diffusion barriers such as cell membranes and organelles 13,14. Moreover, DKI is suitable for evaluating water diffusion in the WM as well as in the GM. By providing new measurements of axial kurtosis, radial kurtosis and mean kurtosis, DKI has been shown to be potentially more sensitive than DTI for detecting microstructural changes in normal aging brains and those with Parkinson disease 15,16.\nAlthough the GM has histologically been shown to be vital for evaluating AD pathology, imaging studies on the microarchitecture of GM are rare. To investigate the capability of DKI parameters for characterizing the microstructural alterations of both GM and WM in patients with MCI and AD, and to determine whether these parameters could serve as imaging biomarkers of cognitive deficiency, we conducted ROI analyses focused on the four cerebral lobes (temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital lobes), which have previously been studied in the DTI literatures. We hypothesized that the DKI model and additional information provided by kurtosis parameters could be used to better characterize microstructural alterations in both the WM and GM with greater accuracy and potentially greater sensitivity 17.",

Spatial Gaussian smoothing using full-width-half-maximum of 2.5 mm was then performed. The apparent diffusion and kurtosis coefficients were calculated to obtain the diffusional tensor and kurtosis tensor, which were used to derive fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, axial kurtosis, radial kurtosis and mean kurtosis using in-house MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) programs 18,19 (Fig. 1).\nFor each subject, T1-weighted images and b0 images were first oriented in the same direction. The T1-weighted images were then co-registered to the b0 images. Next, the co-registered T1-weighted images were segmented into GM, WM and cerebrospinal fluid in its original resolution using FSL (Fig. 1). These segmented images were then re-sliced into the b0 image space. The processed WM and GM images were converted into binary masks and overlaid on maps of DKI parameters for further quantification analyses of WM and GM in the regions of interest (ROIs).",

In reference to T1-weighted images on the b0 images, a radiologist outlined the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes bilaterally on all the consecutive slices in which the cerebral lobes could be clearly identified. The frontal lobe began at the most cranial slice that included a full-volume lateral ventricle in at least one hemisphere. The parietal lobe ROIs were positioned posterior to the central sulcus on the most caudal and subsequent more cranial slice. The temporal lobe ROIs were placed posterolaterally to the lateral sulcus. The occipital ROIs were positioned on slices where the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle was imagined. The contours of the ROIs were then examined by another radiologist and overlaid on maps of DKI parameters for each subject, and the corresponding mean values of the parameters in each ROI were calculated. The WM and GM masks were utilized simultaneously with drawn ROIs to calculate the mean value of the parameters in each matter.\nMann-Whitney U test was used to compare the mean values of parameters in all brain regions between the AD and MCI groups. The correlations between regional parameters and MMSE score, between parameters and age, and between MMSE score and age were tested using Pearsons correlation. All reported P values were two-tailed.

      "text": "There are several recent DTI studies of comparable sample size that have compared AD and MCI groups, but the results of these studies are inconsistent. While Fellgiebel et al. 5,6, Kiuchi et al. 4 and Choo et al. 3 observed no significant difference between AD and MCI groups, Medina et al. 2, Stahl et al. 7 and Zhang et al. 1 noted elevated diffusivity or decreased fractional anisotropy in regions such as the splenium of the corpus callosum or the posterior cingulated in AD. Consistent with most of these studies, we observed no significant differences in mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy in the temporal and frontal lobes between the MCI and AD groups. Significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in parietal WM were observed in the AD group, which corroborated the results of a recent study that investigated a slightly larger patient cohort 9. In addition to the findings in the parietal lobe, the AD group exhibited significantly increased radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy in the occipital WM. These findings were supported by tract-based DTI studies in which significantly increased mean diffusivity was observed in fiber tracts contained within the occipital lobe in ADs, as compared to MCIs 20,21. Our findings in parietal and occipital lobes were, suggestive of a more severe impariment in posterior brains.\nIn the parietal WM, besides significantly increased radial diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy, significantly decreased radial kurtosis was also observed in AD patients. One possible neurobiological explanation for this observation may be a large change in intra-axonal radial diffusion in strongly oriented axon bundle areas, the mechanism for which could be the breakdown of the myelin membrane that resulted in a higher degree of water permeability along the radial direction, but unaltered axonal skeletons and axial diffusion (no significant difference in axial diffusivity was observed). The observed significantly increased radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in the occipital WM of the AD group may be explained by a similar mechanism.\nThe MMSE score is the most widely used brief screening measure of cognition. It has been demonstrated to play an effective role in cognitive screening in the elderly and may help differentiate between AD and MCI. However, previous studies that investigated the association between MMSE scores and fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity reported controversial results. Although the studies by Bozzali et al. 10 and Morikawa et al. 11 reported significant correlations with MMSE scores for fractional anisotropy, Yoshiura et al. 22 demonstrated correlations only for mean diffusivity rather than for fractional anisotropy. Other studies by Stahl et al. 7 and Ibrahim et al. 12 found no correlation for either of these two parameters. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate significant negative correlations between MMSE scores and the mean values of axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the WM of the temporal and occipital lobes. In addition, significant correlations were observed for mean diffusivity and no significant correlation was observed for fractional anisotropy, which was in agreement with the results of Yoshiura et al. 22. New kurtosis measurements, such as axial kurtosis in the parietal lobe and axial kurtosis and mean kurtosis in the occipital lobe, exhibited significant positive correlations with MMSE score, and the correlation for radial kurtosis in the temporal lobe was almost significant (P.056). It is also worth noting that, in the parietal WM, axial kurtosis was the only parameter that exhibited significant correlation with MMSE score. Together with differences in parameters observed between the groups, the substantial correlations between MMSE score and DKI parameters further indicate that the cognitive decline of AD and MCI patients can be attributed to microstructural changes such as axonal loss or demyelination in the WM. Furthermore, by directly reflecting the microstructure of brain, the new kurtosis parameters of axial kurtosis and mean kurtosis along with the conventional diffusivity parameters of axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity in WM can serve as biomarkers for evaluating cognitive impairment.",

      "text": "In previous pathological studies, abnormalities in GM structures have been reported to contribute to the disease of AD. However, few DTI study results are available to better understand the changes in GM during cognitive decline. Because water diffusion in GM is nearly isotropic, the clinical values of the diffusivity parameters derived from DTI are largely limited. Although a DTI study using very small ROIs located in the GM and another study using voxel-based analysis demonstrated significant mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy differences in the parietal and occipital GM between patient groups and normal controls 23,24, we are unaware of any prior studies of AD and MCI based on segmented GM tissue. In the GM, we observed significant differences between AD and MCI groups in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity of the parietal lobe and in axial kurtosis of the occipital lobe. In addition, significant correlations with MMSE score were observed for axial, radial and mean diffusivity and mean kurtosis of the frontal lobe; radial and mean diffusivity of the parietal lobe; and axial, radial and mean diffusivity and axial kurtosis of the occipital lobe. It is worth noting that, although the parameters in the frontal lobe GM exhibited significant correlations with MMSE scores, no significant result was observed in the corresponding adjacent WM regions, which further highlighted the necessity of imaging investigation into GM microarchitecture.\nThe increase in diffusivity and decrease in kurtosis in several cerebral lobes suggested that GM damage may expand from the temporal lobe to the parieto-occipital association cortices as well as to the frontal lobe. Due to loss of neuron cell bodies, synapses and dendrites, the extracellular spaces were increased, which further resulted in elevated mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity. It was interesting to observe that, in the occipital lobe, where diffusivity parameters and fractional anisotropy failed to differ significantly between patient groups, the kurtosis parameter of axial kurtosis was the only parameter found to be significantly lower in the AD group than in the MCI group.\nAlthough in GM, due to its near isotropic diffusion feature, the independent parameters were considered to contain only mean diffusivity and mean kurtosis, we presented the preliminary results in this pilot study for all parameters including the directional ones to provide a comprehensive perspective with potentially intriguing findings. Although the differences in diffusivity parameters in the parietal lobe corroborated previous DTI findings in GM, the additional correlations with MMSE score for diffusivity parameters were novel. Combined with these findings, the significant difference in axial kurtosis and its correlation with MMSE score in the occipital lobe GM suggested that mean kurtosis and mean diffusivity derived from DKI are capable of differentiating between AD and MCI and of serving as biomarkers for evaluating cognition with high sensitivity to microstructural changes in the GM.",

    "Kurtosis parameters and DKI model": {
      "text": "In the WM and GM combined data set, we observed significant negative correlations between mean kurtosis and mean diffusivity, between axial kurtosis and axial diffusivity, and between radial kurtosis and radial diffusivity, which suggests that the changes in diffusivity were accompanied by a change in diffusional non-Gaussianity. Although the changes in kurtosis parameters, which indicated the geometric distribution of diffusion, can be partially attributed to the changes in absolute diffusivity values along the radial or axial direction, they cannot be explained solely by these changes. To the best of our knowledge, the neurobiological mechanism underling changes in kurtosis remains unclear. However, on the basis of these correlations and the abovementioned findings, kurtosis parameters are suggested to be at least complementary to, if not more sensitive than, diffusivity parameters for detecting microstructural changes in WM and especially in GM. Lastly, the substantial correlations found between MMSE score and most of the DKI parameters and those significant differences of DKI parameters between the two groups supported the use of the DKI model, which fits better to diffusionweighted signals as compared to DTI and therefore has higher accuracy 17,18. However, whether the DKI model and kurtosis parameters are substantially more sensitive than the DTI model and diffusivity parameters for differentiating between patient groups requires further investigation in a larger patient cohort.\nOur study had several limitations. First, in the GM, the relatively small sample size may have contributed to the significant group differences and to the correlations with MMSE score observed for axial kurtosis but not for mean kurtosis. Second, our preliminary results mainly served to demonstrate that DKI could be used as a new imaging tool to assess the severity of cognitive deficiency. Longitudinal studies are needed to verify whether kurtosis parameters are capable of predicting progression from MCI to AD or other types of dementia. Third, although interesting findings in kurtosis parameters were observed in GM, their underlying pathophysiological meaning must be examined in further studies. Lastly, we performed no detailed comparisons in small tissue between patient groups. Additional studies focused on small areas or using tract-based analyses are needed for drawing a more comprehensive conclusion.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Recent evidence, primarily from vertebrate animals, of fluid exchange between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the interstitial space has led to speculation regarding the presence of a glymphatic clearance pathway. Animal models shown that this system is active during sleep and during administration of various types of anesthesia 1,2. These studies suggest that poor fluid exchange between the CSF and interstitial space may be implicated in diverse types of central nervous system dysfunction.\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-ALong the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) 3 has been proposed as a metric with possible sensitivity to glymphatic function (Figure 1). This method relies on the fact that within cerebral white matter regions near the lateral ventricles, the perivascular space lies largely orthogonal to the projection and association white matter tracts. On susceptibility-weighted imaging, the medullary veins, which parallel perivascular fluid motion, can be seen coursing in the axial plane at the level of the superior aspect of the lateral ventricles. At moderate-to-high b-values typically used in DTI (i.e., b1000 smm 2 ), any contribution to the diffusion-weighted signal from flowing venous blood is suppressed. As such, excess diffusion measured in the direction of the medullary veins (transverse direction) and orthogonal to the primary fiber tract orientation has been hypothesized to contain contributions from perivascular, or glymphatic fluid transport. In the DTI-ALPS model, this is quantified as the amount of diffusion in the perivascular direction, in excess of the diffusion in the other nondominant tract. In the projection tract, this other nondominant direction is in the anterior-to-posterior direction and in the association tract, it is in the craniocaudal direction.\nMany neurodegenerative conditions have been the targets of emerging studies of glymphatic dysfunction, due to (i) their largely unknown etiology and (ii) their association with proteinopathy and likely clearance dysfunction 4, as well as (iii) the finding that efflux of radioactive amyloid beta parallels fluid motion to and from the interstitial space to the CSF 2. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a proteinopathy correlated with substantially increased cerebral β-amyloid plaque deposition. Decreased β-amyloid protein egress from the brain is closely tied to impaired glymphatic function 2. The coupling of glymphatic function and clearance of the protein closely associated with AD has prompted speculation that the pathophysiology of other proteinopathies may relate to compromised glymphatic circulation. In support of this, the DTI-ALPS method has been shown to provide reduced diffusion measures in 31 adult participants with reduced cognitive performance as quantified from the established Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 3.\nParkinson disease (PD) is another proteinopathy characterized by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (Lewy Bodies). Alpha-synuclein pathology may begin peripherally, and travel centrally to the lower brainstem, midbrain and neocortex 5. We assess whether perivascular fluid motion, as measured by the DTI-ALPS method, is different in a cohort of participants with PD compared to a population of essential tremor (ET) participants (motor disorder not associated with a proteinopathy). We applied the DTI-ALPS method in 181 adults with movement disorders in a similar anaesthetized state required per clinical indication for deep brain stimulation electrode placement. We evaluated diffusion along, and orthogonal to, perivascular spaces to test the hypothesis that diffusion measures of perivascular fluid motion were reduced in participants with (PD), relative to without (ET) proteinopathy.",

First, diffusion-weighted images were motion-corrected by linear registration to the middle volume using MCFLIRT and eddy current-corrected using the eddy function, and brain extracted with the BET utility with fractional intensity threshold set to 0.3. For all voxels within the brain, tensors, diffusion eigenvalues, and diffusion eigenvectors were calculated from the original diffusion images using the dtifit tool. Next, a board-certified neuroradiologist (C.M.) identified bilateral regions in which the lateral projections of the medullary veins traced orthogonal to the primary diffusion directions as described in the literature3 and demonstrated in Figure 1. Separately within regions of interest (32 mm 3 ) within the projection and association tracts, the separate diffusion parameters were calculated and the DTI-ALPS MEAN score (ALPS-index) was calculated as the mean DTI-ALPS score across both hemispheres according to,\nwhere D  denotes the diffusion parallel to the perivascular space of the medullary veins through both projection and association regions (mm 2 s), and D  denotes diffusion orthogonal to the perivascular space and primary fiber tract duration in the projection and association regions (mm 2 s) (Figure 1). The primary metric from the DTI analysis that was preserved for hypothesis testing was the mean DTI-ALPS score (unitless) or ALPS-index as defined in Eq. 1.",

To account for multiple comparisons, the results from all regression analyses were considered significant at the level of false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. The FDR corrections were applied separately to the results from each hypothesis.\nFirst, group differences in demographic and clinical parameters present in both ET and PD participants were evaluated for continuous parameters using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test or for categorical parameters a Fisher exact test with criteria for significance being two-sided p0.05. We first evaluated mean differences in the ALPS-index between males and females using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the dependence of the ALPS-index with age using a Spearman rank analysis.\nThe primary hypothesis of this study was that the ALPS-index, which has been proposed as a measure of glymphatic function, is lower in a cohort of PD participants compared to a similar population of participants without a proteinopathy-related neurodegenerative process (ET). To ensure that differences in ALPS-index scores between PD and ET were not a result of potential confounding factors, we first matched the two cohorts by age, sex, and DWM Fazekas score. The matching was performed using the nearest neighbor method based on the propensity score of age, sex and DWM Fazekas score, where 72 PD patients were selected to match the 36 ET patients in the cohort at a 2:1 ratio. We over-matched ET patients to add power to our study by including more subjects, and the ratio of 2:1 was chosen since there is little power gain for ratios beyond this 10. Subsequently, we applied a general linear model (GLM) regression analysis using the mean ALPS-index score as the dependent variable and the diagnosis status (PD or ET) as the independent variable. Supplementary hypotheses were that (i) a lower ALPS-index is associated with the presence of cognitive impairment, and (ii) the ALPS-index is reduced in all participants with elevated white matter pathology, as indicated by higher DWM Fazekas score. To evaluate the supplementary hypothesis that a lower ALPS-index score is associated with the presence of cognitive impairment, the above GLM analysis was repeated using the ALPS-index score as the dependent variable, the MCI status (binary classification of MCI or non-MCI) as the independent variable, and age, sex, diagnosis status (PD or ET) and DWM Fazekas score as covariates. To test the hypothesis that the ALPS-index is reduced in participants with more white matter pathology, we performed a GLM analysis using the ALPS-index score as the dependent variable, DWM Fazekas score as the independent variable, and age, sex and diagnosis status (PD or ET) as covariates.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We investigated how a recently-proposed noninvasive imaging measure of diffusion along perivascular spaces, previously hypothesized to be attributable to glymphatic function, differed between adults with movement disorder presentations distinguished by the presence of (PD), or absence of (ET), proteinopathy. Investigation of this cohort was motivated by the hypothesis that cerebral protein (α-synuclein) accumulation may be partly attributable to altered perivascular fluid transport, which has been proposed to be related to glymphatic clearance dysfunction. Regression analyses were applied to control for variations in age, sex, and white matter disease. Sedation is a known modifier of glymphatic function.\nAs glymphatic function is widely recognized to be inactive during the awake state, imaging during sedation may offer a unique window to detect imaging measures of glymphatic function. Sedating healthy control patients for comparison purposes is not feasible. Therefore, the comparison ET cohort was selected as a) the sedating procedure in this group was identical to that of the PD cohort and b) ET is distinguished from PD as it is not recognized as associated with proteinopathy. These findings demonstrate that the ALPS-index is reduced in individuals with PD relative to ET, consistent with the primary hypothesis. Decreased ALPS-index measures are reflective of less robust fluid transport in the direction of perivascular fluid motion. These data support the conclusion that altered perivascular fluid transport in PD may be a mechanism of underlying (α-synuclein) accumulation.\nFirst proposed in 2012 by Iliff et al, the glymphatic system was hypothesized to reflect a previously unrecognized exchange of fluid between the subarachnoid CSF and the interstitial space of the brain parenchyma via the perivascular space and intervening aquaporin 4 channels 1. This exchange of fluid has since been recognized as a likely important mechanism of waste clearance from the brain parenchyma 1,2. Subsequent murine 11, non-human primate 12, and human studies 131415 have further supported the existence of the glymphatic system and provided a new construct through which the potential pathophysiology of neurologic disease may be understood. Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation in particular appears to be closely associated with glymphatic dysfunction 1,2, with one study reporting measurable increases in Aβ in the thalamus and hippocampus following just one night of sleep deprivation 16. As the glymphatic system appears to function as a central waste removal system, impaired clearance of various proteins such as Aβ, α-synuclein, and tau, may result in increasing concentrations of protein aggregates in the interstitial space and neurons. Some degenerative diseases, including α-synucleinopathies, have been speculated to have an associated interstitial fluidopathy, referring to underlying pathology related to abnormal interstitial fluid dynamics 17.\nPD pathophysiology is closely tied to abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein whereas ET pathophysiology is not characterized by abnormal accumulation of protein. A decrease in the ALPS-index in participants with PD relative to ET could parallel earlier ALPS-index results which demonstrated that lower ALPS-index scores were observed in AD and MCI patients with worse mini-mental-state-exam (MMSE) scores 3. Such a result would support a broader argument that protein aggregation is associated with impaired perivascular fluid motion, and possibly glymphatic function in humans. Furthermore, this would provide additional support to the notion that the DTI-ALPS method is sensitive to glymphatic function.\nOur results also point toward a statistically significant inverse relationship between white matter disease severity, as measured by Fazekas white matter scoring, and the ALPS-index score. White matter disease severity, commonly characterized as chronic microvascular ischemia, is therefore closely associated with impaired measures of perivascular motion, as measured by the DTI-ALPS method. We also observed a significant decline in the ALPS-index score with increased age. The ALPS-index score was not related to cognitive impairment assessment after controlling for white matter disease burden, age and sex.\nTaken together these findings support a more sophisticated understanding of how the DTI ALPS method may offer insight into the fluid dynamics in the brain. The presence of proteinopathy is demonstrated to be independently associated with altered measures of fluid motion in the brain parenchyma.\nThese findings should also be considered in light of several strengths relative to prior work. Our study benefits from a much larger patient number (n181) as compared to the initial DTI-ALPS investigation (n31) 3. Furthermore, we build upon the prior study by employing robust regression analysis to further define how white matter burden, sex, age, and neuropsychological status affect DTI-ALPS measures. Another distinguishing feature of this study is that the patients uniformly underwent MR imaging under general anesthesia, eliminating motion artifacts and potential variables such as sleep or awake state which could confound results.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be considered. Our study is limited in that the DTI-ALPS method offers an indirect proposed mechanism of assessing glymphatic function at one anatomic level of the brain. As there are limited, if any, methods for measuring glymphatic function in humans without intrathecal contrast injections, we investigated the relevance of this method in a larger cohort of participants to better understand the contrast mechanism. It must be noted that the contrast mechanism, as we demonstrate here, is also related to age and white matter status and care should be taken when assigning DTI-ALPS measures to glymphatic function. Second, this study could have regional bias as it only focused on perivascular fluid motion around the lateral ventricles due to the orthogonal direction of vessels, neurons, and the ventricles and not in other areas of the brain. It is not known how diffusion orthogonal and parallel to perivascular spaces may differ in other brain regions. Regional α-synuclein levels were not cross-correlated with DTI-ALPS values as α-synuclein values were not available in this cohort. Finally, variation within each group is substantial and the difference in mean values is modest. Therefore, despite significant difference among cohorts, this method cannot be used on an individual level. Further work is needed to develop methods capable of differentiating patients on an individual level.\nIn conclusion, we investigated how a newly-proposed noninvasive imaging measure of potential glymphatic function varied between individuals with PD, an α-synuclein proteinopathy, and individuals with ET which is not associated with abnormal protein accumulation. We observed decreased ALPS-index scores in PD compared to ET patients. We also observed an inverse relationship between white matter disease severity and age with ALPS-index scores. These results support the conclusion that altered perivascular fluid transport in PD may be a mechanism of underlying (α-synuclein) accumulation.",

Figure 1A shows a minimum intensity projection of a susceptibility-weighted-image (SWI), demonstrating that the lateral projections of the medullary veins course in the right-left direction (x) at the level of the lateral ventricles. A map of fiber tracts at this location (Figure 1B) shows that where the medullary veins course in the right-left (x) direction, the principal fiber tract runs orthogonally, in the craniocaudal direction (z) in the projection region and in the anterior-posterior direction (y) in the association region. In Figure 1C-D subsequent magnifications of the projection and association regions along the medullary veins with the diffusion tensors represented as ellipsoids. Figure 1E shows a schematic of the principal fiber tract orientation in these two projection and association regions demonstrating that the perivascular space runs parallel to the medullary vein and therefore orthogonal to the principal fiber tract orientations. In Figure 1F, the orientations of the diffusion components that course orthogonal to the principal fiber tracts within these voxels can be represented as a diffusion component orthogonal to both the perivascular space and principal fiber tract (yellow) and parallel to the perivascular fluid motion (gray). The ALPS-index score is a measure of the ratio of the diffusion parallel to the perivascular space and the diffusion orthogonal to the perivascular space (yellow), without incorporating the diffusion information from the primary fiber tracts. The x-component of the diffusion direction (D xx ; arrow) in the projection region may have perivascular fluid motion relevance, given the expected direction of perivascular fluid motion is along medullary veins while the projection and association fibers run orthogonal to the medullary veins at this location.

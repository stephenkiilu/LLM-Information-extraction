      "text": "Vascular risk factors (VRF) have been consistently related to cognitive impairment and dementia 123 . Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) is associated with stroke and with subclinical ischemic brain lesions 4 , and there is increasing interest in its relevance and contribution to cognitive dysfunction 5 . However, there can be vascular cognitive decline even in the absence of clinically detectable precipitating events 6,7 . MRI studies including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can assess microstructural changes in the normal-appearing white matter (WM) before they can be visualized using conventional MRI. These early changes have been associated with cognitive function, regardless of WM atrophy and WM lesion volume 8 .\nRisk markers for VCI are generally the same as traditional risk factors for stroke 4 . It may be important to identify other early and noninvasive markers of VCI in asymptomatic middle-aged adults, in order to obtain possible targets for prevention.\nThe measurement of middle cerebral artery-pulsatility index (MCA-PI) is an ultrasonologic, noninvasive, validated and easily reproducible technique. PI is an indicator of increased distal resistance to blood flow 9 and it has been associated with microvascular dysfunction 10 . MCA-PI offers a picture of the structure and function of cerebral small vessels, less accessible to morphological studies. MCA-PI has also been evaluated in the field of cognitive impairment and dementia.\nMCA-PI is found to be related to Alzheimer disease 11,12 and to WM lesions (WMLs) in hypertensive 13 and stroke patients 14,15 . Mok et al. 16 found a relationship between MCA-PI and severe WML but not with lacunes or microbleeds in subjects older than 60 years. In a small group of hypertensive and diabetic elders, Purkayastha et al. 17 found an association between MCA-PI and WMH, but not with miscrostructural brain changes measured by MRI-DTI. In the Barcelona-AsIA-Neuropsychology Study, including 747 asymptomatic subjects with a wide age range (51-91 years), we found an independent association between MCA-PI and lower cognitive performance 18 . The relationship between MCA-PI and microstructural DTI-WM changes of concrete tracts in a population-based sample has never been explored.\nThe aim of this study is to assess the association between a noninvasive cerebral ultrasound measurement, microstructural WM integrity and cognition in a middleaged asymptomatic population.",

MCA spectrum was recorded by placing the sample volume along the M1 segment at a depth of 45-50 mm and applying angle correction. PI was later calculated in the work-station by a semi-automated method. Mean value of PI in both sides was employed for data analysis.

The resulting images were merged into a single 4D image. The mean FA images were then created and thinned to obtain the mean skeleton, which represents the center of all tracts common to the group. Each subjects aligned FA data were projected onto this skeleton. The resulting skeletonized data were then used for voxelwise cross-subject statistical analysis.\nFA was the only DTI measure employed in this study.

The Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method 26 was used to identify significant clusters. The threshold was set at an uncorrected voxel p value of 0.05 because we expected to find subtle WM changes in our sample.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our study points to an independent association between MCA-PI, cognitive function and WM disintegration in community-dwelling asymptomatic participants aged between 50 and 65. These results are in line with our previous report in Barcelona-AsIA study with 747 subjects (in the age range 51-91), which showed an independent association between the intracranial vascular resistance measured by MCA-PI and cognition 18 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study that focuses on the association between MCA-PI and cognition in community samples. In the cited study, we showed that subjects with an elevated MCA-PI fared poorly in tests of visuospatial skills, attention, and speed. In the present study, with a younger sample and a more extensive neuropsychological battery, we found that intracranial MCA-PI was related to lower executive functioning, attention, verbal fluency, memory and psychomotor speed, and thus it supports our previous findings.\nIncreased MCA-PI has been associated with the presence of WMLs in hypertensive subjects 13 and with WMLs volume 14 and presence of leukoaraiosis 15 in stroke patients. Mok et al. 16 proposed the use of MCA-PI for the screening of severe WMLs. Purkayastha et al. 17 also reported a relationship between higher MCA-PI and WMLs in hypertensive and diabetic elders. However they found no association between MCA-PI and the global values of WM integrity assessed with FA and MD. The use of global measures calculated within large WM areas instead of a voxelwise approach within specific tracts could probably lead to a lack of association between intracranial resistance measures and DTI parameters. In our middle-aged asymptomatic sample, MCA-PI was related to diffuse WM disintegration within specific tracts. MCA-PI increases were associated with decreased FA in the fornix, the right and left corticospinal tract, and the right anterior thalamic radiation. Mean FA of significant tracts were related to attention, psychomotor speed and visuospatial abilities. These results are consistent with previous reports of altered WM diffusivity profiles and cognitive impairment. Patients with attention deficit disorder seem to have decreased FA values in the corticospi-nal tract and fornix 28,29 , and fornix FA values have also been related to impaired processing speed in normal aging 30 . Executive functioning, verbal fluency, and memory domains were related to PI but not to WM disintegration. Microstructural WM disintegration in tracts related to MCA-PI may be one of the main underlying mechanisms by which MCA-PI affects cognition even in a middle-aged asymptomatic sample, but it is probably not the only one. The importance of impaired cerebral perfusion in the development of subcellular, metabolic, and physiological deficits that can initiate and progressively worsen cognitive decline 31 has been indicated .\nPrevious studies have found carotid artery pulsatility related to brain aging evaluated by brain MRI 32 and cognitive testing 10,32 and have highlighted the importance of vascular stiffness in the field of primary and secondary prevention of VCI.\nThe design characteristics were one of our studys main strengths. As prevention may be useful against VCI, our study was designed to detect early markers in asymptomatic middle-aged adults. Our neuropsychological tests were specifically selected to be sensitive to VCI. Furthermore, the DTI technique is thought to be more sensitive to early microstructural WM damage than conventional MRI 33 .\nThe limitations of our study include a relatively small sample size and a cross-sectional design that prevented us from making causal inferences from these associations. On the other hand, we would like to emphasize that the associations of PI with WM integrity did not reach the corrected level, although our overall results are convergent. This limitation in our findings may be due to the characteristics of our sample, which included healthy adults within a young age range (50-65). We sought to identify early markers, which probably exerted subtle effects on cognition and WM integrity in asymptomatic middle-aged adults. Correction methods for type I errors are frequently too conservative, leading to the failure of detecting relevant findings. Despite this weak association between intracranial PI and WM integrity, the mean FA within all significant areas was associated with lower performance in attention, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial skills, which is also coherent with the VCI pattern.\nOur results are in line with those found by Mitchell et al. 10 and with their proposal of including PI as part of clinical assessment. Further prospective studies might include longitudinal measures of MCA-PI with older samples to confirm whether intracranial PI is unequivocally related to WM disintegration and cognitive decline, and to identify the underlying mechanisms between them.",

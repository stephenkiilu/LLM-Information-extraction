    "abstract": "Background and Objectives Research on olfaction and brain neuropathology may help understand brain regions associated with normal olfaction and dementia pathophysiology. To identify early regional brain structures affected in poor olfaction, we examined cross-sectional associations of microstructural integrity of the brain with olfaction in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study. Methods Participants were selected from a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults; selection criteria included the following: evidence of cognitive impairment, participation in a previous MRI study, and a random sample of cognitively normal participants. Microstructural integrity was measured by 2 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and olfaction by a 12-item odor identification test at the same visit. Higher FA and MD values indicate better and worse microstructural integrity, respectively, and higher odor identification scores indicate better olfaction. We used brain region-specific linear regression models to examine associations between DTI measures and olfaction, adjusting for potential confounders. Results Among 1,418 participants (mean age 76  5 years, 41 male, 21 Black race, 59 with normal cognition), the mean olfaction score was 9  2.3. Relevant to olfaction, higher MD in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions, namely the hippocampus (β -0.79 95 CI -0.94 to -0.65 units lower olfaction score per 1 SD higher MD), amygdala, entorhinal area, and some white matter (WM) tracts connecting to these regions, was associated with olfaction. We also observed associations with MD and WM FA in multiple atlas regions that were not previously implicated in olfaction. The associations between MD and olfaction were particularly stronger in the MTL regions among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with those with normal cognition (e.g., β hippocampus -0.75 95 CI -1.02 to -0.49 and -0.44 95 CI -0.63 to -0.26 for MCI and normal cognition, respectively, p interaction  0.004).

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Olfactory impairment, or loss of sense of smell, is a common condition, especially in older adults (with a prevalence of approximately 25 in individuals aged 53 years or older and up to 63 in those aged 80 years or older). 1 It can result from gradual or sudden damage to peripheral or central olfactory structures. Olfactory impairment is also an early manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). 2,3 Olfactory structures have been suggested to be one of the earliest brain structures to develop AD-related tauopathy and PD-related α-synucleinopathy, years before the onset of clinical symptoms. 2,3 With accumulating evidence on the associations of olfaction with AD and PD risk, 456 olfaction has been suggested to have potential to serve as a noninvasive, yet nonspecific, marker of early brain changes related to these diseases. 2,3 A few crosssectional studies have also linked olfactory impairment with adverse neuropathologic outcomes including diminished primary and secondary olfactory cortices, tau pathology, and elevated brain amyloid accumulation in individuals with normal cognition, 78910 although inconsistently. 11 However, additional clarity on where olfactory impairment lies in the pathophysiologic continuum of AD and other dementias is warranted. Furthermore, we also lack adequate evidence of the association of olfaction with possible brain effects other than the central olfactory structures.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that uses water molecule diffusion properties to inform about the integrity of tissue microstructures. 12,13 DTI has been widely used for studying white matter (WM) of the brain, although less often for gray matter (GM) microstructure. 13 Due to its sensitivity to subtle cellular alterations, DTI of the brain has been suggested to detect early neurodegenerative microstructural changes, before the emergence of more conspicuous pathology and cognitive decline. 14151617 Prior studies examining the neuroanatomical correlates of olfaction have mainly focused on brain volume measures (which are late macrostructural changes occurring downstream of neurodegenerative processes), 9,18 thus warranting research on olfaction and DTI markers. In addition to helping understand brain regions associated with normal olfaction physiology, research on microstructural changes in the brain and olfaction, both early subclinical manifestations of neurodegeneration, can provide further clarity on the early pathophysiology of dementia and PD. However, there have been only a few epidemiologic studies on brain microstructure and olfaction, nearly all based on small clinical samples (n  100), and 1 population-based study of 265 participants. 192021 Building on a prior study that examined the neuroanatomic correlates of olfaction using voxel-based morphometry and regional brain volumes, 18 in this study, we examined crosssectional associations between microstructural integrity of brain tissue, including WM and GM, and olfaction using data from the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study (NCS). Based on the prior understanding, we hypothesize that better microstructural integrity of the brain, specifically in some temporal and frontal regions, is associated with better olfaction. In the previous ARIC study, olfactory impairment was associated with smaller amygdala volume in individuals with normal cognition and smaller medial temporal lobe (MTL) region volumes (those regions known to be the primary targets of AD pathogenic processes) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), potentially reflecting the earlier and later effects of the dementia pathogenesis. 18 Therefore, we additionally evaluated whether the patterns of microstructural changes related to olfaction are distinct among individuals with MCI, a dementia precursor, compared with those among individuals with normal cognition.",

      "text": "The ARIC study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 15,792 community-dwelling adults (aged 45-64 years at enrollment visit 1 in 1987-1989) from 4 US communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Washington County, MD; and suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 22 participants were invited to participate in the ARIC NCS. The ARIC NCS performed comprehensive neuropsychological assessments including olfactory assessment in all ARIC participants attending visit 5 (n  6,538) but selected only a subset of participants for MRI. Participants were selected for MRI if they had evidence of cognitive impairment at their visit 5 examination or had previously participated in the ARIC Brain MRI study in 2004-2006. In addition, a random sample of the remaining cognitively normal individuals was selected. So, this analysis is a cross-sectional investigation that included the participants who received a brain MRI scan and underwent odor identification testing at ARIC visit 5, as a part of the ARIC NCS. Of the 6,538 participants who attended the visit 5 examination, 1,978 were selected for MRI examination. Participants without DTI measures (n  27) and olfactory assessment (n  84) were excluded. Furthermore, participants of race other than Black or White (n  6, due to small numbers), Black participants from the Minnesota and Maryland centers (n  9, due to racecenter aliasing), and those with missing covariates selected for confounding adjustment (n  434) were excluded, leaving 1,418 individuals in the final analytic sample (eFigure 1, links.lww.comWNLD27).

      "text": "The brain imaging protocol is described in detail elsewhere. 24 In brief, brain MRI scans were performed at 3T and processed by the ARIC MRI Reading Center at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). Estimated total intracranial volume was measured on sagittal T1-weighted 3D volumetric magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (with 1.2  1.0  1.0 mm resolution in the x, y, and z directions, respectively) using Freesurfer version 5.1, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was measured on axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences (with 0.9  0.9  5.0 mm resolution in the x, y, and z directions, respectively).\nAxial DTI sequences were used to obtain region of interest (ROI)-wise diffusion measurements, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). MD (expressed in mm 2 s) provides the overall magnitude of diffusion. FA measures the extent to which water molecule diffusion is constrained in one direction relative to other directions. FA is unitless, with values ranging from 0 (perfectly isotropic diffusion) to 1 (anisotropic with all molecules diffusing in the same direction). Higher MD and lower FA values generally indicate lower microstructural integrity. FA and MD were used to evaluate WM microstructural integrity, and MD was used to evaluate GM integrity. Unlike WM tracts, GM is not expected to contribute detectible FA signal.\nWe used 2 brain atlases for brain parcellation-the Lobar-22 atlas (based on the inhouse STAND400 template, eFigure 2, links.lww.comWNLD27), which delineated the brain into lobar and deep GM and WM regions, and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) single-subject Eve atlas that provided more fine-grained ROIs (primarily WM tracts and a few GM structures). 25,26 This allowed us to comprehensively examine the associations of olfaction with broader regions not covered by the JHU atlas and to identify specific, more granular WM tracts. Details on DTI including preprocessing steps are described in eAppendix 1 (links.lww.comWNLD25) and elsewhere. 24 Other Covariates Information on time-invariant covariates (sex, center race Mississippi-Black, Minnesota-White, Maryland-White, North Carolina-Black, and North Carolina-White, and APOE 4 status) and education (high school, high school or equivalent, and high school) was obtained at enrollment. Race was selfreported. Information on age, smoking status (current, former, and never), body mass index (BMI, kgm 2 ), serum total cholesterol (mgL), diabetes (defined as fasting glucose 126 mgdL, nonfasting glucose 200 mgdL, self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, or antidiabetic medication use), blood pressure (BP) status (hypertension defined as systolic BP  140 mm Hg or diastolic BP  90 mm Hg or antihypertensive medication use), prevalent stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, head injury, and global cognition factor score was obtained during the visit 5 examination. Global cognition factor scores were derived from 10 cognitive tests administered at the visit 5 examination using a latent variable approach; the cognitive tests and methods are described elsewhere. 27 Participants cognitive status (normal cognition, MCI, and dementia) was determined based on in-person cognitive evaluations, informant interviews, surveillance of hospitalizations, and expert adjudication for in-person examinations. 28",

      "text": "DTI measures from right and left brain ROIs were combined to form single ROI measures. In addition to examining specific atlas ROI microstructural integrity measures (FA and MD), we also considered broader region-specific or pathwayspecific composite measures. Specifically, we aggregated DTI Neurology.orgN information of relevant atlas ROIs (i.e., associated structural components) based on topographyanatomy into a composite measure for a broader brain ROI (e.g., the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampal cingulum JHU atlas ROIs were aggregated into the cingulum brain ROI in the JHU atlas).\nLikewise, we aggregated DTI information of the atlas ROIs that were implicated in prior studies of olfaction (i.e., literature based) to form an a priori olfaction pathway ROI (all atlas, brain, and pathway ROIs are summarized in eTables 1A and 1B, links.lww.comWNLD26). 9,29,30 Last, we combined the atlas ROIs that showed associations between microstructural integrity measures and olfaction in our analysis (data-driven approach) with the literature-based a priori olfaction pathway ROI to form a combined olfaction pathway ROI. More details on this and DTI measure computation are available in supplemental methods (eAppendix 2, links.lww.comWNLD25).\nWe used separate multivariable linear regression models to examine cross-sectional associations between ROI-specific microstructural integrity measures (independent variable) and olfaction test score (dependent variable). We adjusted for age, sex, center race, education, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, prevalent heart disease, BP status, diabetes, total cholesterol, BMI, stroke, head injury, APOE 4 carrier status, and estimated total intracranial volume in our primary model (referred to as primary covariates hereafter). We present the results as the difference in olfaction scores associated with 1 SD higher FA or MD. To examine the influence of global cognition on the associations, we performed regression analysis additionally adjusting for global cognition factor scores. Furthermore, we estimated associations separately for individuals with normal cognition and individuals with MCI to evaluate whether the associations differed between these groups and tested for the interaction between cognitive status (MCInormal) and DTI measures using the likelihood ratio test. We excluded dementia from this stratified analysis because of small numbers (n  67). To facilitate the interpretation of our findings, we compared the magnitude of associations between DTI measures and olfaction with the magnitude of the association between age and olfaction; the age association was examined using a separate model with age as the independent variable adjusting for sex, education, and center race.\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding individuals with dementia from the primary analysis (n  67);\n(2) adjusting for small vessel disease (SVD) markers, including WMH volume, cerebral infarcts, and microbleeds, in addition to primary covariates; (3) incorporating sampling weights to account for the sampling approach used to select participants for MRI; (4)",

      "text": "Among 1,418 participants (mean age  76  5 years, 41 men, 21 Black participants, and 87 with at least high school education), the mean olfaction score was 9  2.3 (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles  8, 10, and 11, respectively) and 15 (n  206) had anosmia (Table 1). There were 59 (n  830) with normal cognition and 37 (n  520) with MCI.\nFigure 1 shows the results of the Lobar-22 atlas regions in the overall sample. In the FDR-corrected analysis (eTable 1A, links.lww.comWNLD26), higher WM FA (i.e., better WM microstructural integrity) in the temporal and occipital periventricular atlas regions, anterior corpus callosum, and deep brain regions were significantly associated with olfaction. The associations were stronger in the temporal periventricular ROI (β 0.23 95 CI 0.10-0.36 per 1 SD higher FA) and deep brain regions (β 0.22 95 CI 0.08-0.35), which were similar to the difference in olfaction scores associated with approximately 2.8 years younger (lower) age; the β estimate for age (i.e., the difference in olfaction scores associated with 1 year older (higher) baseline age) was -0.08 (95 CI -0.10 to -0.06). Likewise, after FDR correction, higher WM MD and GM MD (i.e., lower microstructural integrity) in all atlas ROIs (except in the brain stem) and in the aggregated brain and olfaction pathway ROIs were significantly associated with lower olfaction score; the associations were strongest in the temporal lobe ROIs. After FWER correction, FA associations persisted only in the temporal periventricular and deep brain regions while MD associations were significant in nearly all atlas ROIs. We observed associations in additional regions in analysis that did not adjust for multiple comparisons.\nIn the analysis that additionally adjusted for cognition (eTable 2A, links.lww.comWNLD26), associations with GM and WM MD, although generally attenuated (with β coefficients in the same direction as before), persisted in most regions. However, when adjusted for FDR, the associations with WM MD were supported only in the temporal and deep brain regions and the associations with GM MD were significant in all regions except for the parietal and frontal In the JHU atlas regions, higher WM FA in 21 atlas ROIs (of the 51 examined) was nominally associated with higher olfaction score (Figure 2, eTable 1B, links.lww.comWNL D26). However, after FDR correction, associations remained significant only in 15 regions, which included a few ROIs in the parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes; the corpus callosum; the association fibers including the cingulum, uncinate and fronto-occipital fasciculus; the stria terminalis of the fornix; and some projection fibers (e.g., the anterior corona radiata). Associations remained significant in 7 regions after FWER correction. Likewise, higher WM MD in 42 atlas ROIs (of the 50 examined) was associated with lower olfaction score after FDR correction, of which 32 remained significant after FWER correction.\nWhile the associations were generally comparable in magnitude across all atlas ROIs, we observed stronger associations with WM FA in the stria terminalis of the fornix and with WM MD in the stria terminalis, uncinate fasciculus, and hippocampus. Lower GM MD in the amygdala, entorhinal area, hippocampus, and thalamus was also associated with lower olfaction score (all corrected p values 0.05); β estimates ranged from -0.42 (95 CI -0.57 to -0.26) for the thalamus to -0.79 (95 CI -0.94 to -0.65) for the hippocampus, which correspond to the differences in olfaction scores associated with 5 and 9.5 yearss higher baseline age, respectively.\nThe associations in the JHU atlas regions were also attenuated when adjusted for cognition (eTable 2B, links.lww.comWNL D26). Specifically, the associations with MD persisted in most regions (25 of the 50 after FDR correction), but those in some occipital and frontal regions and corpus callosum were no longer statistically significant. After FWER correction, the associations persisted in the MTL regions, lateral fronto-orbital, hippocampal cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate, stria terminalis, and internal capsule regions. Of the 21 regions that were associated in the primary analysis of FA, none remained significant after FDR and FWER correction, but nominal associations were seen in the precuneus, superior occipital, anterior corona radiata and internal capsule, fronto-occipital and uncinate fasciculus, and stria terminalis.\nThe results were generally somewhat attenuated compared with those of our primary analyses when we excluded participants with dementia (eTables 3A and 3B, links.lww.com WNLD26) but inferences were similar (e.g., β -0.79 95 CI -0.94 to -0.65 vs -0.66 95 CI -0.81 to -0.51 for the hippocampus for with and without dementia, respectively). When additionally adjusted for WMH volume, infarcts, and microbleeds (eTables 4A and 4B), the results were similar to those of our primary analyses, suggesting these SVD markers do not explain the observed associations. Furthermore, we repeated the analysis adjusting a minimal set of covariates (eTables 5A and 5B), and the results were mostly similar.\nLikewise, the results of the analyses that accounted for sampling weights to select participants for MRI were generally comparable with those of the primary analyses (eTables 6A and 6B), although the associations in some olfactory regions were slightly attenuated.\nFurthermore, the analyses that modeled the number of incorrectly identified odorants using negative binomial regressions yielded similar inferences (eTables 7A and 7B, links. lww.comWNLD26), supporting the robustness of our linear regression analyses. The analyses examining DTI markers and anosmia prevalence (defined using a clinical cut point) also yielded similar inferences as our primary analyses (e.g., the largest prevalence ratio 1.86 (95 CI 1.60-2.16) was for the hippocampus, eTables 8A and 8B). When stratified by cognitive status, the associations between microstructural integrity measures and olfaction were generally qualitatively similar between those with normal cognition and MCI (Figures 3 and4, eTables 9A and 9B, links.lww. comWNLD26). Nonetheless, the associations with MD in the amygdala, entorhinal area, and hippocampus were stronger among those with MCI (all FDRFWER corrected p values 0.05) (e.g., βs for the hippocampus -0.44 95 CI -0.63 to -0.26 and -0.75 95 CI -1.02 to -0.49 in individuals with normal cognition and MCI respectively, p interaction  0.004). However, the statistical tests for interaction between MD and MCI status were not significant for the amygdala (β -0.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this community-based study of older adults, we found that microstructural integrity of multiple brain regions was associated with odor identification ability. The strongest associations with MD were observed in olfactory pathway regions (namely, the temporal lobe ROIs in the Lobar-22 atlas and the MTL ROIs in the JHU atlas) and some WM tracts connecting to these regions, although MD in most atlas regions was associated with olfaction. We also observed associations between higher WM FA and better olfaction in multiple regions, primarily in the periventricular regions in the Lobar-22 atlas and in selected JHU atlas regions in the parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes and WM tracts. Associations in many of these regions persisted even after adjusting for global cognition factor scores (although attenuated), suggesting these are not explained by cognition alone. Furthermore, we observed that the associations between GM MD and olfaction were particularly stronger in the MTL regions among individuals with MCI compared with those among individuals with normal cognition.\nMicrostructural integrity measures (particularly MD) in many brain regions, including those traditionally not associated with olfaction, were associated with odor identification ability. Nonetheless, stronger associations in the MTL regions (which include some central olfactory structures) underscore greater relevance of these regions for olfaction. Furthermore, our findings suggest that olfaction depends on microstructural integrity of the WM tracts connecting the central olfactory structures. Odor identification involves numerous aspects of cognitive processing including odor perception, memory, and semantic abilities. 3,31 Further, older adults, compared with their younger counterparts, seem to demonstrate more widespread brain activation extending beyond primary olfactory networks during olfactory processing, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to age-related decline in olfactory and cognitive abilities. 32 These findings could explain associations across diffuse brain regions in this older cohort (when compared with localized associations we expected). While these associations were attenuated after adjusting for cognition in some regions, the pattern persisted for MD. Furthermore, alterations in neurotransmitter systems have also been implicated in olfaction. It is possible that observed associations in some regions reflect neurodegenerative changes in neurotransmitter circuits. 33 Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that associations of olfaction with anatomically broad-based regions simply reflect parallel co-occurring age-associated (or pathogenic) neurodegenerative processes and they do not have any functional relevance to olfaction. Furthermore, though we adjusted for a comprehensive set of covariates, some of these findings could be due to unexplained confounding. Moreover, we did not see associations in some regions that are likely relevant for olfaction-a potential explanation could be measurement error resulting from magnetic susceptibility artifacts because DTI uses echo planar imaging, which is prone to these kinds of artifacts near the olfactory tracts.\nWe observed that MD was more frequently associated with olfaction (and more often strongly) than FA. While the explanation for such differential associations is not clear, prior studies have also found MD to be more sensitive for detecting cognitive impairment and age-related reduction in microstructural integrity of the brain than FA. 34,35 Global MD was in fact among the earliest MRI markers to change with increasing age in the Rotterdam study. 35 Our findings are generally in line with those of prior studies on olfaction and brain neuropathology, although only a handful have examined associations with brain microstructure. For instance, in a subsample of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study (n  265), prior hyposmia was associated with higher GM MD in the right middle orbitofrontal gyrus and the amygdala 10 years later. 21 In a study of 30 healthy adults aged 51-77 years, WM microstructural integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculi was correlated with better olfaction. 20 In a study of 19 individuals with amnestic MCI (aMCI), lower mean diffusivity in multiple WM tract regions was associated with higher olfaction scores (somewhat diffused associations as observed in ours). 36 Other studies were generally based on small clinical samples of individuals with PD or AD. 19,37 Of relevance, several studies have linked odor identification ability with brain MRI markers, including volumes, hypometabolism, and tau pathology, specifically in the olfactory cortices and AD signature areas, 7-10 although not consistently. 11 Compared with individuals with normal cognition, we found stronger associations between cortical MD and olfaction in the MTL regions including the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal areas among those with MCI, reflecting the later effects of dementia pathogenesis. This is in line with previous study findings (including the ARIC study) showing lower MTL volume activation in olfactory task-based MRI and greater MTL neurodegeneration (including diminished volumes and loss of functional connectivity and GM microstructural integrity) among individuals with MCI compared with cognitively normal individuals. 18,3839404142 MTL regions are involved in both memory and olfactory processing and are brain regions where AD-related tau and Lewy body diseaserelated α-synuclein pathologies appear early in the course of these diseases. 2,43,44 In AD, particularly, tau pathology occurs initially in the MTL regions, which later progresses to other brain regions, and this temporal and spatial course of tauopathy progression has been suggested to coincide with cognitive deficit patterns. 44,45 While it is possible that stronger associations in the MTL regions may be related to early taurelated neurodegeneration, we have not attempted to tease apart dementia etiology in these analyses. Relatively few studies have evaluated the association between brain microstructure and olfaction by cognitive status. For example, studies have reported correlations of WM integrity measures in the whole brain, in the orbitofrontal gyrus, and the inferior occipital gyrus with odor identification score in individuals with aMCI andor AD, but not in cognitively normal individuals. 19,46 In a study of the olfactory tract integrity and cortical glucose metabolism, those with MCI showed associations in the MTL and posterior cortical structures, while cognitively normal individuals showed associations in the anterior cerebral structures. 47 We, however, were limited in that we were not able to explore patterns for prodromal PD.\nStrengths of the study include large community-based sample of Black and White participants, availability of comprehensive information on potential confounders, and brain region DTI measures. Our study has also several limitations. First, its cross-sectional nature limits us from making inferences about temporality of the associations. We based our study on a premise that poor microstructural integrity of the brain would result in olfactory impairment; however, impaired olfaction can occur from damage to peripheral olfactory structures, and olfaction status has also been suggested to alter brain neuropathology, alluding to a possible bidirectional nature of the associations. 48 Second, we used an odor identification test that is cognitively demanding. An odor sensitivity test, which gauges an individuals ability to detect odor concentration and is less cognitively demanding, would have shed additional light on the relationship between brain microstructures and olfaction independent of cognition. Third, the JHU atlas is based on a scan of a single 32-year-old person, and it thus has individual features (when compared with a population-averaged atlas). So this cohort being comparatively older, atlas ROIs may not have aligned well with anatomical features of some participants, potentially resulting in measurement error, especially for smaller atlas regions. Fourth, we excluded individuals with missing data on covariates for adjustment, which may have biased our findings. Finally, the inferior surface of the frontal lobe is an area of sharp changes in magnetic susceptibility and thus prone to signal attenuation and distortion in clinically compatible diffusion MRI sequences, unfortunately making the olfaction bulb and entorhinal cortex challenging regions for DTI.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that microstructural integrity of the brain is associated with olfaction, even after accounting for cognition. While we cannot generalize our findings to younger populations, our findings hint at the possibility of involvement of additional regions (outside of the currently recognized central olfactory structures) in olfaction processing in older populations, possibly to compensate for the age-associated loss in olfactory and cognitive abilities. Specifically, associations of olfaction with multiple brain regions, not detected in our prior volumetric analyses, 18 likely reflect that DTI measures, MD and FA, are more sensitive than volumetric measures. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that some of these regions do not have any functional relevance to olfaction and just reflect spatiotemporal correlation associated with cooccurring neurodegenerative processes. The differential associations in the MTL regions in individuals with normal cognition and MCI may reflect earlier and later effects of the dementia pathogenesis marked by olfactory loss. Future studies incorporating AD-related brain biomarkers may help shed more light on olfaction as an early manifestation of AD specifically and its utility in predicting individuals with high future AD risk. In addition, the current findings need further confirmation; specifically, longitudinal studies with repeated DTI and olfaction measures may help elucidate microstructural integrity changes and associated olfactory decline.",

      "text": "Examination of brain structural and functional abnormalities in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has the potential to enhance our understanding of the initial pathophysiological changes in dementia.We examined gray matter volumes and white matter microstructural integrity, as well as resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in patients with aMCI (N  48) in comparison to elderly cognitively healthy comparison subjects (N  48). Brain volumetric comparisons were carried out using voxelbased morphometric analysis of T1-weighted images using the FMRIB Software Library. White matter microstructural integrity was examined using whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analysis of fractional anisotropy maps generated from diffusion tensor imaging data. Finally, rsFC differences between the samples were examined by Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimised Decomposition into Independent Components of the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging time series, followed by between-group comparisons of selected networks using dual regression analysis. Patients with aMCI showed significant gray matter volumetric reductions in bilateral parahippocampal gyri as well as multiple other brain regions including frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices.Additionally, reduced rsFC in the anterior subdivision of the default mode network (DMN) and increased rsFC in the executive network were noted in the absence of demonstrable impairment of white matter microstructural integrity.We conclude that the demonstrable neuroimaging findings in aMCI include significant gray matter volumetric reductions in the fronto-temporo-parietal structures as well as resting state functional connectivity disturbances in DMN and executive network. These findings differentiate aMCI from healthy aging and could constitute the earliest demonstrable neuroimaging findings of incipient dementia. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2017; 25:158-169) Key Words: dementia, Alzheimers disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), independent component analysis (ICA), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) M ild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cog- nitive decline greater than expected for an individuals age and educational level without notable interference on the individuals activities of daily life. 1 MCI is a transitional pre-dementia phase in all types of dementia including Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. Within MCI, those patients having predominant memory complaints, specifically recall, with relatively intact encoding, are grouped under amnestic MCI (aMCI). 2 Patients with aMCI exhibit a conversion rate of 41 after 1 year and 64 after 2 years to AD; a rate that is much higher than non-amnestic MCI. 1,3,4 Neurobiological studies in aMCI provide us with a unique opportunity to explore the pathophysiological aberrations that are evident in the initial stages of conversion to AD.\nVolumetric reductions, especially in the temporal and prefrontal cortices, have been reported during healthy aging. 5 The brain volumetric changes seen in aMCI 6,7 are intermediate between those seen during healthy aging and mild AD, thus suggesting aMCI represents a pre-clinical or transitional stage between healthy aging and dementia. 8 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides reliable estimates of white matter microstructural integrity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is the most commonly used DTI quantitative parameter that represents a measure of microstructural integrity. The majority of previous studies in MCI using whole brain voxel-wise DTI analysis have not shown demonstrable abnormalities of FA in patients with MCI using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). 9,10 Some studies, however, have reported frontal and parietal white matter changes in aMCI. 11 In contrast, more widespread disintegration of white matter has been reported in patients with AD. 11,12 The functional organization of the brain at rest can be studied by functional connectivity (FC) analysis of the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series. 13 Decreased FC in various resting state networks (RSNs), especially the default mode network (DMN), has been reported not only in pa-tients with mild AD 14 and MCI 15 but in elderly cognitively healthy subjects as well. 16 Additionally, increased rsFC in the executive and frontal networks have been reported in patients with mild AD. 14 We have recently reported decreased rsFC in the DMN and increased rsFC in the executive network (EN) in patients with mild AD in absence of demonstrable abnormalities of white matter microstructural integrity using whole brain DTI analysis. 17 Thus, the brain changes reported in aMCI so far have been inconsistent and might be intermediate between healthy aging and AD. Such inconsistencies in the existing literature may be due to various factors such as small sample sizes, 14,18 varied methods of analyses, 19202122 etc. There is a need to examine the structural and functional brain changes that characterize aMCI within the context of a single study in a reasonably large cohort using standard analysis pipelines. The utility of these aberrations as early imaging biomarkers of conversion to aMCI and later on to AD could be then examined in future studies.\nThe present study attempts to extend the findings of previous studies by aiming to characterize the abnormalities in regional brain morphometry, microstructural integrity as well as rsFC in a relatively large sample (N  48) of patients with aMCI using the methods described here. We hypothesized that our sample of patients would demonstrate whole brain volumetric reductions as well as regional volumetric reductions, predominantly in the medial temporal and frontal areas, in comparison with a sample comprising elderly cognitively healthy comparison (eCHC) subjects, matched for age, sex distribution, and educational status. Given the high conversion rate of aMCI to AD, we further hypothesized that the aMCI sample would show reduced resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the DMN along with an increase in rsFC in the executive, frontoparietial, and frontal salience networks as reported in previous studies in early AD. 14,17 Because there are no consistent reports of FA aberrations in specific brain regions in aMCI or early AD, we adopted a whole-brain approach to our DTI analysis. We assumed the null hypothesis for the between-group comparisons of FA, in accordance to previous findings in patients with aMCI and mild AD using whole-brain TBSS. 12,23",

These subjects were recruited as part of an ongoing funded research project carried out by the GCS in collaboration with the MBIAL at NIMHANS. Patients aged more than 55 years and of either sex, with a diagnosis of aMCI according to the National Institute of Aging and Alzheimers Association criteria 2 were recruited for the study along with a sample of age and sex-matched eCHC subjects. Patients with aMCI and eCHC subjects had Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDRs) of 0.5 and 0, respectively. The exclusion criteria included concomitant treatment with psychotropic agents such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, etc.; comorbid medicalneurologicalsurgical conditions like hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, vitamin B12 and niacin deficiencies, neurosyphilis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, subdural haematoma, delirium, vascular pathology, etc. Investigations to rule these out are part of the standard clinical evaluation protocol followed at the GCS. Overall cognitive ability, severity of dementia, as well as activities of daily living were assessed in both the groups using the Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE), 24 CDR, 25 and Everyday Activities Scale for India (EASI), 26 respectively. Detailed clinical history based on a study-specific proforma was collected from the healthy subjects as well as the primary caretaker in case of patients with aMCI. We excluded those individuals with evidence of small vessel disease (SVD) secondary to vascular risk factors in both healthy and aMCI samples using Fazekas scoring, performed by an experienced neuroradiologist (J.S.) on each participants T2 FLAIR images. Only those individuals who had a Fazekas grade of 1 or less for both periventricular and deep white matter, and who had no cortical or subcortical lacunar infarcts, were included in the study. 272829 None of the patients were initiated on any nootropic agents.",

As noted earlier, we had reported decreased connectivity in DMN and increased connectivity in the EN in a sample of patients with mild AD. 17 In fact, these two networks were noted to be the first two components of the ICA output of our data, with maximum explained variance above 3 and total variance above 2 in the Gaussian gamma mixture model. In keeping with our a priori hypothesis, DMN, EN, bilateral frontoparietal and frontoinsular salience networks were identified as per Beckmann et al. 33,34 and then used for component-based dual regression analysis to generate spatial as well as temporal differences between two groups (refer to the Supplementary material for details).\nThese analyses generated differential maps with MNI coordinates of voxels that showed family-wise errorcorrected group-wise differences by threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) 35 using Randomise (FSLs tool for nonparametric permutation inference on neuroimaging data) at a significance threshold of randomization p less than 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons-for each voxel in whole-brain morphometric analysis, for each voxel constituting the mean FA skeleton, and for each RSN individually in selected networks using Randomise and Dual Regression 36,37 (refer to the Supplementary material for details).

No significant betweengroup differences were noted in the bilateral frontoparietal and frontoinsular salience networks.\nIn a post-hoc attempt to integrate the findings from the different imaging modalities, we first examined whether the brain regions that showed volumetric reductions in aMCI also showed reductions in white matter integrity, by comparing the FA values between groups within the region of interest (ROI) masks of these regions (Figure 4, Table 4). We then examined whether the brain regions that showed rsFC aberrations in aMCI (paracingulate gyri and frontal pole) also showed variations in regional volume and white matter structural integrity by performing ROI-based VBM and FA comparisons of these regions, respectively, between the two groups. We found significantly reduced regional cortical volume of the frontal pole in the aMCI sample in comparison with the eCHC sample (Figure 5; Table 5). There were no significant differences in white matter microstructural integrity in this region in patients with aMCI, however. No significant relationship between cortical volume, white matter structural integrity, and rsFC aberrations could be established in the paracingulate region.\nAdditionally, we performed post-hoc regression analyses to examine the possible link between memory scores and the MRI parameters, namely, regional cortical volumes and rsFC. We performed a regression analysis of delayed recall scores separately with volumes of bilateral parahippocampal region, rsFC in DMN, and rsFC in EN in the combined sample (aMCI  eCHC) to examine the relationship, if any, between delayed recall and brain volumes or rsFC. We found a significant positive linear relationship between parahippocampal gray matter volume and delayed recall scores. No other relationship was noted between the brain volumes or rsFC with the delayed recall scores.",

Resting-state FC reductions in the posterior DMN 14 have been noted consistently in AD, including a previous report from our own laboratory. 17 In a study of DMN connectivity in elderly cognitively healthy subjects, 16 however, decreased connectivity of both anterior and posterior subdivisions of the DMN was noted in older subjects, with the activity in the anterior subregions being positively correlated to cognitive performance and negatively correlated with age in the older subjects. Therefore, alteration of rsFC in the anterior andor posterior subdivisions of the DMN is indeed seen in elderly cogntitively healthy subjects, amnestic MCI patients, as well as AD patients. Whether there is a differential or sequential involvement of these DMN subdivisions from healthy aging to aMCI to AD, however, requires further examination in larger samples of subjects. In agreement with other studies performed on mild AD subjects, 14,17 we also found increased rsFC within the executive network in the aMCI group involving brain regions such as paracingulate gyrus and frontal pole. These regions are involved in higher order cognitive processes such as prospective memory, working memory, as well as other execu-tive functions. This increased connectivity in the EN might reflect a compensatory mechanism in response to the progressive memory impairment caused by pathology in the medial temporal brain regions 44 as well as in the prefrontal regions. These findings of reduced FC in DMN and increased FC in EN in our aMCI sample are similar to the results that we recently reported in patients with mild AD. 17 Post-hoc analyses aimed at integrating the findings of VBM, DTI, and rsFC analyses (Figures 4 and5, Tables 4 and5) revealed a possible link between cortical volume loss and increased rsFC in the bilateral frontal pole. These preliminary post-hoc results might point to a possible relationship between cortical neuronal loss and increased rsFC in the rostral prefrontal cortex, probably of a compensatory nature. The rsFC aberrations, however, may not be entirely explained as secondary to cortical volume loss, as is indicated by the lack of volumetric differences in the paracingulate regions of the DMN that showed reduced rsFC. Therefore, the presence of rsFC disturbances may be considered as an indicator of incipient dementia. 16 Our results also indicate that rsFC disturbances may not be always secondary to disturbances in white matter structural integrity. Moreover, it may be noted that in our sample of aMCI there were no statistically significant differences in white matter microstructural integrity. Thus, cortical volume loss secondary to incipient dementia may not necessarily be accompanied by demonstrable changes in white matter microstructural integrity. The post-hoc regression analysis to examine the link between delayed recall scores and parahippocampal cortical volume as well as rsFC in DMN and EN revealed a significant positive linear relationship between parahippocampal gray matter volume and delayed recall scores, although no significant relationship emerged between delayed recall scores and rsFC in the DMN and EN.\nThe present study used whole-brain exploratory image analyses methods to characterize abnormalities of gray matter volume (VBM), white matter microstructural integrity (TBSS), and resting state functional connectivity (ICA-dual regression). Certain methodological considerations must be kept in mind while interpreting the results of the study. Our samples did not differ in age, sex distribution, or educational status (Table 1), although the aMCI sample had a significantly higher proportion of subjects having comorbid hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The earliest evidence for causal associations between these vascular risk factors and ensuing dementia are the presence of white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, micro-hemorrhage, and macro-hemorrhage. 45,46 Because the focus of our study was on amnestic MCI, we excluded those individuals with evidence of small vessel disease secondary to the vascular risk factors in both healthy and aMCI samples (refer to the Methods section). It may be contended that excluding subjects with SVD could affect the generalizability of the results to the entire population of aMCI, because about one-half of patients with AD have concomitant cerebrovascular disease. 47,48 Nevertheless, we have not excluded patients with concomitant hypertension or diabetes (refer to Table 1) and have only excluded individuals with evidence of SVD. This enabled us to infer that the connectivity aberrations noted in our sample are likely due to the primary neurodegenerative pathology of incipient dementia. It is our prediction that those individuals with concomitant SVD will have connectivity aberrations (explainable due to the additional effects of regional hypoperfusion) over and above the connectivity aberrations that we have noted in our cleaner sample. We would plan to test this hypothesis in large enough samples of aMCI with and without evidence for SVD in the future. We do not have longterm follow-up data of our aMCI cohort at present and therefore the number of subjects within the sample who have subsequently converted to AD is not known. We have included only four covariates that are likely to influence functional connectivity the most in keeping with our sample size. Nonetheless, other sources of variability across samples such as overall cognitive status, duration of illness, and so forth may also need to be controlled for in future analysis on larger samples of patients with aMCI. Finally, the inherent methodological issues related to whole brain voxel-based morphometric analysis of brain volumes, 31,49 whole brain tract-based spatial statistics method for DTI analyses, 50 as well as the dual regression method for rest fMRI analyses, 51,52 are applicable to our study as well.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no previously published papers on functional or structural connectivity changes in aMCI from India, which has a prevalence of about 4.3. 53,54 Multimodal brain imaging studies in the Asian population have reported that the structural and functional connections within DMN weakens in aMCI and AD. 55 A previous study from China has linked atrophy of frontal and temporal cortices to executive function deficits in aMCI. 38 These findings are largely in concordance with those reported in the western literature. 14,19,56 The present study provides support to the finding of reduced rsFC in the DMN in a relatively large sample of patients with aMCI from India. Further, we extend the previously reported findings by demonstrating increased rsFC in the executive network, which could potentially reflect a compensatory process.",

      "text": "In conclusion, the major findings of the present study are demonstrable brain volumetric reductions and rsFC changes in patients with aMCI in the absence of demonstrable white matter microstructural changes. Because gray matter volumetric reductions have been reported even with elderly cognitively healthy subjects, 49 the rsFC aberrations might potentially be considered as the earliest demonstrable neuroimaging findings of incipient dementia. Demonstrable pathology of white matter microstructural integrity may follow in those patients with aMCI who would later convert to AD. Increased rsFC in EN might reflect compensatory mechanisms secondary to the early structural and functional impairments associated with the evolving dementia pathology.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate whether there are any white matter changes in a 6-month follow-up of mild-moderate Alzheimers patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and Methods: We recruited 18 mild-moderate Alzheimers disease patients and they underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at recruitment and at 6-month follow-up. Diffusion MRI images were processed using DTI-ToolKit to create a population-based tensor template. This template was integrated with a voxel-wise and atlas-based analysis in FSL to determine the magnitude and location of change in diffusion metrics over the 6-month follow-up period. Results: There were significant widespread changes in diffusion metrics across the entire white matter skeleton (P  0.001), 95 confidence interval (CI) difference in fractional anisotropy: 20.007 (20.011, 20.002), mean diffusivity: 0.040 (0.023, 0.058), axial diffusivity: 0.015 (0.008, 0.022), radial diffusivity: 0.012 (0.006, 0.019), as well as regions of interest in the splenium and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusion: Our findings show that diffusion metrics are altered in a 6-month follow-up period of mild-moderate Alzheimers patients, supporting the potential of DTI metrics to act as sensitive biomarkers for disease progression even over a relatively short time interval, and the potential utility to be applied to clinical trials of putative disease-modifying therapies.",

      "text": "A lzheimers disease is a neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions. The course of Alzheimers disease pathology can be up to 20-30 years, and be pathologically present for a number of years while a person is apparently cognitively normal, 1,2 highlighting the need for a reliable biomarker for early intervention and to assess the effect of any potential interventions. 3 There has long been great interest in identifying biomarkers capable of assessing local properties of white matter to monitor the progression of Alzheimers disease. Quantitative neuroimaging tools that measure the microstructural properties of white matter provide promise for investigating how white matter is altered by aging, disease progression, or even therapeutic intervention. 4 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has been shown to noninvasively detect microstructural changes in white matter. 5 Diffusion of water in the brain is a passive process, and can be manipulated with MRI protocols in order to infer white matter properties and structure. In early aging, without evidence of cognitive impairment, DTI has been shown to detect microscopic changes in white matter that can eventually lead to dementia. 6 Many studies have applied DTI to assess white matter differences between Alzheimers disease populations and healthy controls; however, there is a lack of longitudinal DTI studies in Alzheimers disease. Of those longitudinal studies that have been performed, it has been shown that changes in white matter microstructure are detectable over a 12-month time interval. 7,8 Despite the common use of DTI in clinical studies to assess white matter microstructure, difficulties in imaging postprocessing exist when studying patients with Alzheimers disease. The brains of Alzheimers disease patients are very morphologically different to the templates generated from young normal patients to which the Alzheimers brains are warped. In advancing Alzheimers disease, pathology presents as cortical atrophy, enlarged ventricles, and sulcal dilation, 9 which is also seen in diffusion MRI images. Because of this pathology, much of the brains neuroanatomical structures do not correspond to a standard healthy template of the brain on a voxel-based level, posing problems when performing voxel-wise statistical comparisons on a group level. Because of these issues, diffusion MRI analysis methods have developed in an attempt to offer more robust approaches for group-level analyses. Some studies have successfully created elderly population-based templates to represent the average brain in an elderly group, 101112 which is an alternative to registering to standard space. This method has a number of advantages, as high-quality registrations are easier to achieve, as less interpolation is required to register to an elderly brain than a healthy brain.\nIn addition to ensuring a population-based template is employed, methodology of registrations is also a contentious issue that can impact results. Recently, studies have shown that modifying existing diffusion MRI processing and analysis pipelines with more advanced registration suites can improve alignment and therefore influence the sensitivity and specificity of results. 8,13,14 Zhang et al 15 developed the tensor-based registration algorithm DTI-ToolKit (DTI-TK), which uses explicit optimization of tensor reorientation in an analytic manner. The tensor-based registration method not only removes the biases associated with direct fractional anisotropy (FA)-to-FA circular registrations described previously, 16,17 it also provides additional constraints to guide the registrations by incorporating all eigenvalues and eigenvectors during the deformable stage of the registrations to achieve better anatomically corresponding white matter structures. Furthermore, studies are focusing on providing modifications to the widely used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline-which has been shown to improve the reliability of TBSS to detect longitudinal changes in a population. 8,181920 The purpose of this present study was to investigate if an advanced DTI processing pipeline could detect subtle changes in white matter microstructure over a 6-month follow-up of a mild-moderate Alzheimers disease population.",

      "text": "The diffusion MRI data were preprocessed using FSL 23 by correcting for eddy current-induced distortions and subject movements using the Eddy correct tool, skull stripping the raw DTI images using the BET tool, and fitting the diffusion tensor with weighted least-squares using FSLs diffusion toolbox. 24 The diffusion data were then processed through a pipeline combining DTI-TK tools for population-based template creation, and FSL tools for image analysis, described below and outlined as a flowchart in Fig. 1.\nTENSOR-BASED PIPELINE. DTI-TK 15 was used to create a population-based template in an unbiased way using both the average diffusion features (eg, diffusivities and anisotropy) as well as the anatomical shape features (such as tract size) in the population, using all images at both timepoints. First, all of the eigenvalue and eigenvector outputs from the diffusion-tensor fitting step were prepared for each participant, and converted to a single volume in DTI-TK format. Then an initial population specific template was bootstrapped with all of the tensor inputs using the IXI aging template. 25 Finally, the template was refined with affine and deformable alignment to improve alignment quality by removing size or shape differences between local structures, and resampled to 1 mm 3 isotropic resolution. For the registration step, the tensor images were registered to the population-based tensor template using diffeomorphic alignments. Following registration, 4D files containing the FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (A x D) and radial diffusivity (RD) data were created for integration with TBSS. 26 TBSS INTEGRATION. To integrate the tensor images registered to our template with TBSS, we customized the postregistration step in TBSS. The mean FA image was created and skeletonized based on the population, the white matter skeleton was thinned (excluding voxels with an FA  0.3), and each participants aligned FA data were then masked by the mean FA skeleton, creating an all-FA skeletonized file. These steps were followed for MD, A x D, and RD, with manual integration to project the mean FA skeleton onto the remaining diffusion metrics.\nATLAS-BASED INTEGRATION. Second, an atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was employed on a priori selected white matter regions in the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white matter atlas. 27 First, we registered our population-based template to the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas in FSL using the FLIRT tool. 28 Using the transformation matrix from this registration, we applied the inverse transform to each white matter label to transform the labels to our diffusion template space. Each label was then overlaid onto our population-based template, and manually edited with ITKSNAP 29 for concordance with our population-based template. The genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum were investigated, alongside the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), to compute change in FA, MD, A x D, and RD over time. The mean FA skeleton was also included in this analysis.",

For this statistical analysis, two methods were employed. First, Randomise 30 was used to permute statistical inferences on the longitudinal data by executing a simple general linear model to test changes over time, including demeaned age as a covariate. Threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) 31 with 2D optimization was employed and the number of permutations was set to 10,000. Following statistical analysis, regions that were significantly changed after correcting for family-wise error were thresholded at P  0.01. For the atlas-based analysis, the mean FA, MD, A x D, and RD were computed for each ROI. A related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to determine the significance level of each diffusion metric over time in the regions.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Here we report the implementation of a DTI pipeline for template creation and registration to enhance the reliability of longitudinal analyses in patients with Alzheimers disease. Our TBSS findings showed that widespread changes in diffusion metrics are detectable on longitudinal imaging over a 6-month time interval in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimers disease. Additionally, the ROI analysis revealed significant alterations in FA in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as the right superior longitudinal fasciculus.\nPrevious studies that have assessed cross-sectional differences in FA between Alzheimers disease and healthy controls have consistently revealed decreases in FA in the corpus callosum, SLF, and cingulum 323334353637 -which agrees with our findings. The longitudinal alterations in these diffusion metrics are consistent with previous work done that identified FA and MD changes in the genu and body of the corpus callosum, fornix, and left cingulum over a 12-month follow-up DTI study, 8 highlighting that these regions are still vulnerable to change even in progressive mild-moderate Alzheimers disease. Another study showed decreased FA and increased RD in the splenium of the corpus callosum in mild Alzheimers patients over 12 months. 38 In the first part of a multi-timepoint study it was found that FA remained stable over 3 months, 39 and in a follow-up study of the same population, significant increases in FA and MD were identified at 12 months, but not at 6 months. 7 Many theories have been proposed as to why these regions are particularly vulnerable to show progressive changes in patients with Alzheimers disease, particularly the corpus callosum. Early work presented by Braak and Braak 9 proposed that the disconnection between the two hemispheres, notably by the loss of white matter in the corpus callosum, can lead to cognitive disturbances and a disruption of communication between interconnected networks across the brain. Additionally, the participants in our study were on average 10 years older than those in Keihaninejad et als 8 12-month study, which may explain the absence of change in the cingulum, and significant FA change in the splenium of the corpus callosum across all diffusion metrics, as opposed to the genu.\nAlongside FA changes, we also found significantly increased MD, A x D, and RD in the white matter skeleton. Animal studies have provided some insight as to what axial and radial diffusivities represent in vivo, where changes in A x D have been associated with axonal damage, and increases in RD have been associated with myelin breakdown, 40,41 providing some insight into the pathological relevance of these measures of diffusivity. In Alzheimers disease, previous research has shown that mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were sensitive to white matter abnormalities in the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulum, fornix, and splenium of the corpus callosum, which were consistent with their expected predictions of white matter degeneration using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and structural MRI. 42 The pattern of changes in these diffusion metrics in Alzheimers disease are not well established, hence further studies are needed in this area.\nChanges in tensor metrics have also been associated with the macroscopic reorganization of white matter fibers, axonal density, and glial infiltration, resulting in spurious changes in the magnitude of diffusion in a certain direction 43,44 ; therefore, a full investigation of the diffusion tensor is required to assess specific changes in white matter over time. In our mild-moderate Alzheimers disease population, the results from the mean, axial, and radial diffusivities supported the ROI-based neuroanatomical locations of FA change, and also further implicated the genu.\nAn important finding of this study is that this advanced DTI method was able to detect widespread changes in diffusion metrics in the short 6-month follow-up period. This is particularly important when looking at potential biomarkers for short-term disease progression in Alzheimers disease, and how this varies with therapeutic intervention. The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) group demonstrated that changes in brain structure detected by MRI have higher statistical power to detect a disease-modifying drug effect than clinical or cognitive measures because of their low variability. 45 DTI may be better able to assess whether interventions are truly having a positive effect before ending clinical trials prematurely when they do not show positive outcomes with other less-sensitive biomarkers.\nFurther improvements to image analysis can be achieved by including additional imaging timepoints, and implementing more sophisticated diffusion MRI acquisition protocols (ie, increased number of gradient directions, smaller voxel size). Newly developed models such as NODDI 46 are also likely to be of benefit to additionally refine the orientation estimation of white matter. With these improvements, the goal of using DTI in individual clinical patients to help guide treatment may become possible.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "One limitation of this study is the small sample size. Future studies with larger sample sizes should investigate sex and disease duration as potential confounding factors of disease progression. As this was a clinical study, we were unable to access an age-matched control group. Confirmation of these findings in such a control group is an important aim for future research, especially considering that atrophy due to normal aging is a potential confounding factor. Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimers disease is also an important consideration in studies of this kind. Although we attempted to reduce the number of false positives by implementing stricter criteria such as a Hachinski score less than 4 and requiring an MRI within 2 weeks to exclude non-Alzheimer pathology, future studies should consider implementing newer diagnostic criteria to improve the specificity of classifying Alzheimers disease. 47 In conclusion, using DTI we detected evidence of widespread decline in white matter microstructure in a 6month longitudinal study of patients with Alzheimers disease. By implementing an advanced DTI processing pipeline with the creation of an unbiased population-specific template and using tensor-based registrations, our analysis revealed short-term changes in white matter that are consistent with those seen with other longitudinal studies in Alzheimers disease over longer time intervals. Future quantitative studies should focus on how the course of change in diffusion metrics relate to other biomarkers in Alzheimers disease over extended time periods to further validate DTI metrics as potential biomarkers of short-term disease progression.",

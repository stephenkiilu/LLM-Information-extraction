    "abstract": "Purpose: This study assesses the patterns of structural and functional connectivity damage in patients with Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) compared with cognitively unimpaired Parkinsons disease patients (PD-Cu) and healthy controls (HC). Materials and methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) scans were obtained from 30 PD and 21 sex-and age-matched HC. The between-group difference in posterior cingulate (PCC) functional connectivity (FC) was performed to assess FC dysfunction. Atlas-based spatial statistics of DTI was applied to compare White matter (WM) fibers impairment between groups. Results: (1) Functional connectivity: (1) PD-Cu compared with HC showed a decreased PCC functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe (MTL). In addition, PCC-right MTL connectivity strength of PD was significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. (2) PDD group shows a decreased FC of PCC-right parahippocampa compared with PD-Cu group; while show a widespread decreased PCC FC compared with HC group. (2) Anatomical connectivity: (1) Relative to PD-Cu, significant lower FA values were found in the left hippocampus in PDD. (2) PDD showed higher MD values in a widespread WM regions compared with PD-Cu and HC. (3) Positive correlation was observed between MoCA score and FA value of left inferior longitudinal and hippocampus, and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus in PD. Conclusions: Cognitive decline in PD is associated with FC damage of PCC-right MTL and microstructural damage of left hippocampus. Nevertheless, combining fMRI and DTI method may provide markers able to contribute to the prediction of PDD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder diagnosed on the basis of characteristic motor disturbance (resting tremor, rigidity, postural instability and bradykinesia), asymmetrical symptom onset, and good response to levodopa 1. However, cognitive impairment is a well-defined non-motor manifestation of PD, which is characterized by visuospatial and executive dysfunctions, as well as deficits of attention and shortterm recall. Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) develops in up to 80 of patients with PD and has a profound socioeconomic impact 2. Early-stage identification of risk factors for PDD development is valuable from a prognostic perspective as well as for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Therefore, there is an intensive search for biomarkers that may predict the progression from cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD-Cu) to PDD.\nThe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is considered the hallmark neuropathological finding of Parkinsons disease 3. Yet pathological and psychopharmacological studies have suggested that cognitive decline in PD can be secondary to cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) accumulation, Alzheimers pathology, dysfunction of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, and vascular lesions 4.\nRecently, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a potential means of elucidating functional brain architecture 5. Resting-state functional connectivity is attractive for the characterization of complex interactions between brain regions, which describes temporal correlations blood of oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) time series. Rs-fMRI has been adopted as a biomarker in natural history and interventional studies of Alzheimers disease 6 and amnestic mild cognitive impairment 7, but its utility as a biomarker for PD and PDD is unclear. Resting-state networks (RSNs) are characterized by organized basal activity during rest and by low-frequency signal fluctuations that can be studied by fMRI. The RSNs have been less studied using fMRI in PD, but studies have shown rather variable results 8. In PDD, preliminary studies have shown a different pattern, with decreased FC reminiscent of the changes in Alzheimers disease 9.\nBecause diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal abnormalities in white matter fiber structure and provide models of anatomical connectivity (AC), it is rapidly becoming a standard for white matter disorders 10. DTI has been used to demonstrate the role of white matter in PD patients cognitive function. Some studies 111213 assess connectivity alterations in PD, showed that WM damage is associated with the degree of global cognitive impairment, and shown PDD have significant white matter deterioration in a number of brain regions such as the cingulum 11,12, corpus callosum 11, frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes 12,13.\nIn summary, DTI and rs-fMRI studies have revealed abnormalities in several areas of the brain in PD, these methods have expanded our understanding of the disease beyond dopaminergic deficits. However, the neuroanatomical basis and topography of the neurobiological processes that account for these cognitive impairments have not been well characterized due to limitations in prior single-mode neuroimaging analyses. In contrast to the previous studies investigating FC or AC changes in PD, here we combined resting state functional MRI and DTI techniques in the same individuals to explore PD patients cognitive impairment.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We evaluate specific differences in connectivity patterns across 3 groups of subjects: HC, PD-Cu and PDD; and the relationship of altered connectivity and cognitive performance in PD. Functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (fMRI) can localize the human cortical area that correlate with cognitive function and characterize the magnetic resonance signal change, but it cannot provide the information of white matter. Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI) can demonstrate the anatomical connectivity of the human brain in vivo at present. Yet it can provide little information about the cortex. So, fMRI and DTI are complementary, and fMRI in combination with DTI is a promising tool in the neuroscience research. In recent years, some studies 18,19 combining functional MRI and diffusion imaging in the same individuals. Pathologically, PDD is most often associated with the presence of cortical Lewy bodies (LB). A study of PD cases assessing cognitive impairment from retrospective chart reviews showed that severity of cognitive impairment correlated with cortical LBs, especially in cingulate gyrus, even when Alzheimer disease was not present 20. The default mode network (DMN) is one of the most studied RSNs, includes the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal and temporal cortices 21, and is believed to be involved in higher cognitive functions. Previous studies showed the impaired deactivation of the DMN in parkinson disease 8. Most importantly, PCC has been considered as structural and functional core in this network 22. Convergent evidence from histopathologic 20, DTI 11,12 and fMRI consistently suggests that PCC is a key structure in the pathophysiology of PDD. The major finding was an early decreased functional connectivity of PCC-right MTL, in PD-Cu. In deed, we observed a positive association between MoCA score and PCC-right MTL FC strength. This result was high agree with a previous studies 23. PDD showed a decreased PCC-right parahippocampa gyrus FC, and a higher MD values in right cingulate gyrus. Our results were supported by a previous pathology study. The authors examined cognitive impairment in PD, LBs were found most in the cingulate, middle temporal and angular. On the other hand, Studies found PCC-right PCC has direct connections to the MTL, which has direct connections to the hippocampus via both the polysynaptic and direct intrahippocampal pathway 24. In addition, one of the primary long association fibers of PCC is the cingulum bundle, through which PCC has connections that terminate in parahippocampal gyrus WM 25.Taken together, results supporting the idea that early deficits in PCC-right middle temporal gyrus connectivity lead to an increased vulnerability to early cognitive impairment appearing in progression from PD-Cu to PDD.\nOn the other hand, we found FA values of left hippocampus significantly reduced in PDD, and positive correlated with MoCA score. Our result agree well with the study of Camicioli et al. 26, they found the hippocampal volume showed a pattern progressive hippocampal volume loss in PD (HC  PD  PDD); recognition memory and Mini-Mental State Examination scores correlated with left hippocampal volume among PD and PDD. Furthermore, we found an enhanced functional connection of PCC-left lingual. The lingual gyrus is a brain structure that is linked to processing vision, especially related to letters. It is thought to also play a role in analysis of logical conditions and encoding visual memories 27. Notably, A previous studie suggested a potential link between the lingual gyrus and hippocampal regions in the brain 28. We assume that the lingual gyrus play a compensatory role in PD patients cognitive impairment.\nTherefore, we found significantly increased FC of PCC-bilateral IPC in PD-Cu, however this increased FC have not be found in PDD. One the other hand, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) damage have been found in PDD. Studies have shown that examination of structural connections between the PCC and the bilateral IPC is complicated by the crossing fiber tracts of the anterior to posterior SLF and the superior to inferior corona radiata tracts that separate them 29. This finding suggests that increased FC of PCC-IPC play a compensatory role in PD-Cu, while extensive global white matter degeneration in PDD group make this lose. In addition, our findings were generally consistent with previous studies 13, suggest that individuals with PDD have a widespread damage of white matter when compared to PD-Cu and HC, whereas PD-Cu did not show WM abnormalities.\nOur study is not without limitations. First, the patient sample size is relatively small and our results have to be considered preliminary; Second, the potentially confounding effects of chronic dopaminergic medications are not considered in our work. Thirdly, head motion would in turn imply deteriorate image quality. Although our current study excluded the motion artifacts of basic and simple global head movement, the details of the head motions are not assessed in the current investigation. To be prudent, Further studies might determine whether more detailed motion derived parameters. Finally, recent studies 30 have indicated that mild cognitive impairment in PD(PD-MCI) have a higher risk to develop dementia. Future studies will need to recruit larger samples including patients with PD-MCI to confirm our findings.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In conclusion, we found that cognitive decline in PD is associated with abnormalities of structural and functional connections, especially associated with functional connectivity damage of PCCthe right MTL and microstructural damage of left hippocampus. The relationship between connectivity abnormalities and clinical markers obtained using both techniques provided the evidence that the damage of structural connectivity might be the physical foundation in the impairment of functional connectivity. Nevertheless, combining using Rs-fMRI and DTI method might provides a crucial multi-modal validation and reveals the change of the neuron and white matter, which can be valuable for the early diagnosis of PDD.",

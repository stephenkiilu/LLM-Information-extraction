    "abstract": "Our aim was to investigate the extent of white matter tissue damage in patients with early Alzheimer disease (AD) using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI). Although AD pathology mainly affects cortical grey matter, previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed that changes also exist in the white matter (WM). However, the nature of AD-associated WM damage is still unclear. Conventional and DTI examinations (b  1000 smm 2 , 25 directions) were obtained from 12 patients with early AD (Mini Mental State Examination MMSE score  27, Grober and Buschke test score  33.2, digit span score  5.6) and 12 sex-and age-matched volunteers. The right and left mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of several WM regions were pooled in each patient and control, and compared between the two groups. Volumes of the whole brain and degree of atrophy of the temporal lobe were compared between the two groups. In AD, MD was increased in the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the WM in the frontal and parietal lobes. FA was bilaterally decreased in the WM of the temporal lobe, the frontal lobe and the splenium compared with corresponding regions in controls. Values in other areas (occipital area, superior temporal area, cingulum, internal capsule, and genu of the corpus callosum) were not different between patients and controls. No correlations were found between the MMSE score and the anisotropy indices. Findings of DTI reveal abnormalities in the frontal and temporal WM in early AD patients. These changes are compatible with early temporal-to-frontal disconnections.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Pathologic changes in the cortical gray matter of the brain in Alzheimers disease (AD) are characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques along with neuronal and synaptic loss that produce cerebral atrophy. The initial pathologic involvement has been shown to occur in the medial temporal lobes, and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found atrophy of the overall brain as well as early atrophy of the hippocampi in patients with mild AD compared with nondemented elderly controls (Brun and Englund, 1986;Hanyu et al., 1999;Kantarci et al., 2001). AD is generally considered to affect grey matter (GM). The loss of large pyramidal neurons (layer III and V), particularly in cortical associative regions, is the pathological substrate of the progressive dementing process in AD (Pearson et al., 1985). Besides the cortical conditions, several white matter (WM) abnormalities have been described: rarefaction, loss of axons, oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytosis (Brun and Englund, 1986). In line with these observations, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) studies (Bozzali et al., 2001;Hanyu et al., 1999;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2000;Sandson et al., 1999) have also shown microscopic WM changes in patients with AD that are undetected when using conventional MRI. However, to date, the precise topography and extent of these WM changes remain debated.\nPrevious diffusion-weighted (DW) and DTI studies (Bozzao et al., 2001;Hanyu et al., 1999;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2000;Sandson et al., 1999) have shown anisotropic changes in the cingulum, hippocampal structure, WM of temporal, frontal and parietal lobes (Bozzali et al., 2002;Bozzali et al., 2001;Kantarci et al., 2001;Takahashi et al., 2002;Yoshiura et al., 2003), left posterior cingulum (Rose et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002), and posterior part of corpus callosum (Bozzali et al., 2002;Hanyu et al., 1999) in patients with AD compared with controls. A few studies have used DTI in early AD patients or in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is considered to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. While DTI changes were initially described in the temporal area (Kantarci et al., 2001), more diffusively distributed changes have since been reported (Medina et al., in press). The preferential involvement of the anterior part of the brain is supported by a recent study (Choi et al., 2005) while other studies (Head et al., 2004;Medina et al., in press) have shown that abnormalities predominate in the posterior regions.\nIn the present study, we used DTI with gradient applied in 25 directions, calculating mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) to investigate the extent of tissue damage in several brain WM regions in patients with early AD. The ultimate goal of the study was to provide a picture of the distribution of microstructural WM damage in AD to improve our understanding of its nature.",

Twelve sex-and age-matched healthy controls (seven women and five men, mean age  73.4  4.83 years, range  66-80 years, without significant difference be-tween patients and controls) were recruited in the panel of volunteers of our laboratory. The controls had no complaints of cognitive problems and no evidence of cognitive deficits on formal testing. Major systemic, psychiatric and other neurological illnesses were carefully investigated and excluded in all subjects. Hyperintense areas of the WM on T2-weighted MR images were searched for and excluded in all subjects. Local ethics committee approval and written informed consent were obtained from all the subjects before study initiation.",

      "text": "Brain volume was measured by one observer, using a previously described seed growing segmentation technique (Hasboun et al., 1996). Temporal lobe atrophy was assessed by the same observer using semi-quantitative classification (Scheltens et al., 1994;Vermersch et al., 1994).\nAfter transfer of all images to a workstation (Advantage Windows, GEMS, Buc, France), DT images were corrected for geometrical distortions induced by eddy currents using an algorithm that determines the optimum affine transformation to be applied to each diffusion-weighted image, and uses a mutual information similarity test and Powell minimization scheme, from a commercially available software application (Functool Performance, GEMS, Buc, France). Anisotropic maps were generated using the same software. MD and FA maps were derived as previously described (Bozzali et al., 2001). MD and FA were measured in spherical regions of interest (ROIs) of variable sizes (mean: 40 mm 2 ) in several WM regions, care being taken to avoid partial volume averaging from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ROIs were placed bilaterally for paired structures on images acquired without diffusion gradients (b  0 smm 2 ) and were transferred onto MD and FA maps for each subject; anisotropic indices were calculated for each of the selected WM areas. ROIs were placed in the normal appearing WM of the following areas: the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum, the amygdala, the superior temporal lobe, the cingulum, the superior part of frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal WM ROI was placed on a slice that included a fully volumed lateral ventricle. Parietal lobe ROIs were positioned in the WM posterior to the central sulcus on the most caudal slice where it was visible. Temporal lobe ROIs were placed in the superior temporal gyrus. Additional ROIs were placed in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the WM of the occipital lobes, to verify the absence of ipsilateral and contralateral differences in values. The occipital ROIs were placed on the optic radiations, starting from the most caudal axial slice on which the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle was imaged. Fig. 1 illustrates the location of the WM ROIs, and Fig. 2 shows an FA map.",

      "text": "The global brain volume was similar in patients with early AD and in controls (mean brain volumes were 1213  114 ml and 1228  108 ml, respectively; Student t test: P  0.95), while temporal lobe volume using Scheltens classification differed between the two groups, being lower in patients with AD than in controls (Mann-Whitney test: P  0.014). There was no significant difference of anisotropy indices or diffusivity between the right and left side for paired structures in AD and controls in any of the studied regions. We consequently chose to pool the right and left data for paired structures in each patient and compared the mean rightleft measurements for the following intergroup comparisons. MD values were significantly different in the splenium, the frontal WM, and the parietal WM between AD patients and controls, as detailed in Table 1. FA values were significantly different between AD patients and controls in the splenium of the corpus callosum, the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe WM with lower values being observed in AD patients as detailed in Table 2. MD and anisotropy indices of the WM of the genu of the corpus callosum, cingulum, occipital lobe, and internal capsule did not differ significantly between patients and controls. There was no correlation between the MMSE score and anisotropy values.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "DW and DTI studies (Bozzali et al., 2001;Bozzao et al., 2001;Reisberg et al., 2002Reisberg et al., , 1999a,b) ,b) have shown that in addition to cortical GM damage (Yoshiura et al., 2003), there is a relatively large amount of microscopic WM pathology in patients with AD that goes undetected when using conventional MRI. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of microscopic WM damage in AD are still unclear, including whether AD microstructural WM pathology is secondary to or independent of GM pathology. In several brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, DTI can depict differences between WM regions that are not apparent on conventional MR images (Cercignani et al., 2002;Hoptman et , 2002). The above reports indicate that these changes are associated with the microstructural changes of white matter. Pathological (Brun and Englund, 1986) and MRI (Vermersch et al., 1996) studies have shown WM lesions, such as myelin pallor, loss of myelin and axons, astrocytosis and fibrillary gliosis, in patients with AD to be more common than in elderly control subjects. These WM changes could be due to Wallerian degeneration secondary to cortical neurodegenerative conditions (Englund, 1998). In a transgenic mouse model with amyloid deposition, it has been suggested that Aβ peptide accumulation and deposition may, in some way, be linked to WM abnormalities that can be detected by DTI and that AD pathology alone could cause myelin injury in the WM (Song et al., 2004). We found increased MD values in the splenium, frontal and parietal WM, and decreased anisotropy values in the splenium, the frontal WM and the temporal WM, in patients compared with matched healthy volunteers. These findings, which indicate a net loss of barriers restricting water molecular motion, are consistent with histopathological data (Brun and Englund, 1986) and with other DTI studies (Bozzali et al., 2002(Bozzali et al., , 2001;;Kantarci et al., 2001;Takahashi et al., 2002;Yoshiura et al., 2003). Fellgiebel et al., (2004) compared MCI and healthy controls subjects and failed to find significant anisotropic changes in extratemporal areas. The discrepancy between these findings and our own might be due to differences in the study groups. It is, however, difficult to properly compare populations given the limited neuropsychological data provided in the previous study. The more extensive anisotropic changes we observed might also be due to the fact that our AD group was older (mean age: 76.8 years) than the MCI study group of Fellgiebel et al. (mean age: 68.2 years). Consequently, the generally observed age-related decrease in anisotropy might have confounded the disease-related alterations to a greater degree in our study. However, the effect of age-related changes on our final results should be minimal given the use of an age-matched control group. The partial contradiction between our results and those of Kantarci et al. (2001), who reported increased apparent diffusion coefficients restricted to hippocampal regions, may be due to technical differences. While Kantarci et al. used diffusion gradients applied only in three directions, we sampled the signal in 25 directions. This might have increase the sensitivity of DTI for the detection of subtle changes in extratemporal areas (Poonawalla and Zhou, 2004).\nWhile some studies have reported decreased anisotropy preferentially in posteriorly located WM in AD patients (Head et al., 2004), we, like others (Choi et al., 2005;Pfefferbaum et al., 2005), found prominent anisotropic changes in frontal WM. Decrease of frontal WM anisotropy could be explained by early temporal-tofrontal disconnections (Delatour et al., 2004). It is also consistent with the so-called retrogenesis theory (Reisberg et al., 1999a(Reisberg et al., ,b, 2002)), which suggests that the progression of AD deterioration proceeds inversely to human ontogenic myelinisation patterns. Indeed, the frontal WM, one of the last regions to mature during ontogenesis, seems to be altered in early AD (Reisberg et al., 1999a,b). An alternative explanation could also be proposed: with normal aging, WM anisotropy decline exhibits a roughly anterior-to-posterior gradient, with greater changes in the frontal WM than in the temporal, parietal and occipital WM (Pfefferbaum et al., 2005). Accordingly, our results, obtained in early-stage dementia, could reflect age-related changes in the frontal WM whereas posterior changes are not yet detectable using DTI. Since DTI changes have little specificity, other factors, such as ischaemic vascular damage, may also contribute to the DTI changes, although care was taken to exclude patients with severe WM changes.\nIf all sectors of the corpus callosum show atrophic changes in AD (Pantel et al., 1999), we also found a WM anisotropy decline in the splenium while no significance differences between AD and controls were found in the anterior part of the corpus callosum. This confirms and extends findings of other conventional (Vermersch et al., 1996) and DTI studies (Hanyu et al., 1999;Head et al., 2005;Rose et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002). The corpus callosum, one of the most heavily myelinated regions of the brain, consists of fibers arising from large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V, and is topographically organized longitudinally from rostrum to splenium. The splenium contains fibers from the medial temporal region (Seltzer and Pandya, 1986) and consequently may show changes in early AD. Moreover, it contains a relatively large proportion of small diameter lightly myelinated fibers that may be subject to greater degeneration than large diameter fibers (Tang et al., 1997). Finally, while one study (Bozzali et al., 2002) has reported a correlation between MD, FA and MMSE score, we, like others (Bozzali et al., 2001), failed to confirm that statement.\nOur study has several limitations. First, for technical reasons, DTI was acquired in the axial plane without whole brain coverage. Second, one can argue that anisotropic changes might have been better delineated using coronal DTI acquisition (Assaf et al., 2003), especially for imaging the temporal lobes. Yet, there is no consensus on the optimal acquisition plane for DTI. Third, higher b values may be more sensitive to the lesion-to-normal contrast and contrast-to-noise of AD-related WM degeneration, as recently shown (Yoshiura et al., 2003). Last, the ROI approach is not optimal to map the whole brain WM. Partial volume effects on GM and or CSF in the WM sample may blur DTI measures. Others have proposed a histogram-based approach (Steens et al., 2004) or a voxel-based statistical approach (Scahill et al., 2002;Medina et al., in press). However, the method, which implies a smoothing step and a normalization scheme, may limit the sensitivity of anisotropic measurements (Eriksson et al., 2001).",

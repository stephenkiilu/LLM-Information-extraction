    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Imaging research has historically focused on the atrophy of gray matter, yet recent work has shown that changes to microscopic white matter (WM), such as myelin loss, axonal injury, and edema, also occur in early phases of Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) (Brun and England, 1986;Gold et al., 2012;Shao et al., 2019). This pathology is heavily studied because decreased WM integrity is thought to lead to less efficient conduction of neural signals across the brain (Fan et al., 2019). Likewise, many studies have shown reduced WM integrity is associated with age-related cognitive decline (Mayo et al., 2019;OSullivan et al., 2001). In recent decades, measuring such changes in WM in-vivo has become possible due to improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and the development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Gold et al., 2012;Lee et al., 2015). Through DTI, researchers can calculate quantitative measures of extracellular water diffusion that are believed to reflect WM integrity. Such measures include mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (Esrael et al., 2021;Fan et al., 2019).\nPrevious ADRD studies have shown strong evidence that decreased WM integrity is demonstrated by a decrease in FA and an increase in MD (Fan et al., 2019;Gold et al., 2012). Yet what remains less clear is how early in the progression of ADRD do these changes become detectable and which WM pathways show the greatest vulnerability (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Lee et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2017). A pathway of interest in studies of dementia is the cingulum bundle (Fan et al., 2019;Gold et al., 2012;Jacobs et al., 2018;Mito et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2019). The cingulum bundle has dense projections to the hippocampus and other regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), in addition to projections which extend through the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), anterior cingulate and into the frontal lobe (Bubb, Metzler-Baddeley,  Aggelton, 2018;Shao et al., 2019). Due to the complexity of this pathway, tractography imaging toolboxes used in conjunction with DTI further divide the cingulum into ventral and dorsal pathways with the goal of being able to better localize where and when changes within this pathway occur (Bubb et al., 2018).\nFollowing the growth of DTI and tractography, research studies have examined the association between WM and cognitive functions, such as executive function and memory (Mayo et al., 2019;Shao et al., 2019). Fewer studies have assessed whether associations between diffusion measures and cognition are further related to volume of neighboring gray matter (GM) regions, and whether associations of WM integrity and cognition persist after accounting for GM atrophy (Bubb et al., 2018). Through use of participants enrolled in in a study led by the Boston University Alzheimers Disease Research Center (BU-ADRC), the goals of this study were, first, to assess relationships between measures of WM integrity spanning from participants who were cognitively normal to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to those with dementia. Next, we examined associations between WM integrity with regional GM volume. Lastly, we explored associations between WM integrity and volume of selected GM regions of interest (ROIs) with measures of cognition.\nWe tested three primary hypotheses. (1) Participants with dementia would show lower FA and higher MD than participants with aMCI or controls in both the cingulum ventral (CV) and cingulum dorsal (CD) pathways. Between cognitive groups, greater differences in WM integrity would be shown between control participants and participants with aMCI in the CV pathway because the volume and connectivity between MTL regions are often affected in earlier stages of dementia than frontal regions (Tucholka et al., 2018). Likewise, we hypothesized that greater differences between participants with aMCI and dementia would be shown in the CD pathway, To assess whether these differences in WM integrity are ubiquitous or specific to these tracts of interest, diffusion measures in a control region, the corticospinal tract (CST), were examined. (2) Based upon its projections to the frontal lobe, we hypothesized that WM integrity of the CD would show associations with volume of regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and WM integrity of the CV would show associations with volume of regions in the MTL. We expected both pathways would show associations with volume of the RSC. (3) Lastly, we hypothesized that WM integrity of the CD pathway and volume of PFC regions would predict executive function and that WM integrity of the CV pathway and volume of MTL regions would predict memory performance.",

      "text": "We had access to MRI, demographic, and cognitive data from 286 participants within the Health Outreach Program for the Elderly (HOPE), a cohort study led by the BU-ADRC. The BU-ADRC is a center of 40) funded by the National Institute on Aging that contributes standardized data to the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC) each year. The BU-ADRC HOPE registry, including subject recruitment and inclusionexclusion criteria, has previously been described (Ashendorf et al., 2017;Galetta et al., 2017;Sugarman et al., 2020). All participants provided the BU-ADRC with written consent to participate in all aspects of this study. Procedures conducted by the BU-ADRC were approved by our local IRB. The BU-ADRC Executive Committee approved of the sharing of the data for this study.\nAll participants had a NACC diagnosis that was made at BU-ADRC consensus conferences following presentation and discussion of all medical history and evaluation results, such as clinical interview, informant input, neuropsychological test scores, and MRI scans viewed for hippocampal atrophy, WM signal abnormalities, and evidence of microbleeds after the consensus diagnosis was made for the clinical syndrome. For the purposes of this study, only participants with the diagnosis of control (indicating no detectable cognitive impairment), aMCI (with either single or multiple cognitive domains affected), or ADdementia (hereafter referred to as dementia) were included (n  241). Participants with diagnoses such as non-amnestic MCI (in either single or multiple domains, n  10) and cognitively impaired, not MCI (n  35) were excluded.",

T1 and high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) sequences were acquired for all participants on a 3T Philips Acheiva scanner. For T1 scans, a 32-channel head coil and sense factor of 2 was used with the following imaging parameters: TR  6.8 ms, TE  3.1 ms, flip angle  9, reconstructed and acquisition voxel size  .98 mm  .98 mm  1.2 mm , FOV  250 mm  250 mm  180 mm, 150 sagittal slices. For HARDI scans, a 32-channel headcoil and sense factor of 2 was used with the following imaging parameters: TR  10,153 ms, TE  97 ms, flip angle  90, reconstructed and acquisition voxel size  2 mm  2 mm  2 mm, FOV  224 mm  224 mm  128 mm, 64 transverse slices, B  3000 All T1 scans were processed with Freesurfer version 7.2 on a Mac Pro 2013 running OS version 11.6 to obtain cortical parcellations and subcortical segmentations of anatomical regions (Desikan et al., 2006;Iglesias et al., 2015). The three PFC ROIs that were used in our study were the rostral middle frontal gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. The two MTL ROIs were the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, we examined volume of the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus as our measure of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) (Desikan et al., 2006;Vann et al., 2009). This region was included in analyses due to its neuroanatomical location and proximity to both cingulum pathways as well as its role in navigation, spatial and episodic memory (Vann, Aggleton  Maguire, 2009). Total volume of all GM ROI was used in statistical analyses by adding the right and left volume of each region. Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) was also generated by Freesurfer. GM volume measures were adjusted for eTIV and adjusted-GM volumes were converted to z-scores for statistical analyses. HARDI scans were processed with TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA), an updated toolbox available as part of FreeSurfer version 7.2 (Maffei et al., 2021;Yendiki et al, 2011). This processing included eddy-current compensation via FMRIB Software Library (FSL), intra-and inter-subject registration, ball-and-stick modeling, and tensor fitting (Vipin et al., 2019). Intra-subject registration was completed using boundary-based cost (bbregister) and inter-subject registration was completed using systemic normalization from Advanced Normalization Tools. TRACULA is a novel method for automated global probabilities reconstruction of 42 major WM pathways (https: dmri.mgh.harvard.edutract-atlas).To reconstruct these WM tracts, TRACULA utilizes prior information on anatomy from a set of training participants where the tracts of interest were labeled manually. This prior information is the likelihood of each tract to travel through or next to each of the cortical and subcortical segmentation labels previously generated from processing T1 scans through Freesurfer. Our tracts of interest were the CD and CV pathways (Figure 1), and our control tract was the CST. Following reconstruction of all three tracts, FA and MD, were extracted and averaged from both right and left pathways. Averages of both measures were z-scored and used in subsequent analyses.",

    "Statistical Analysis": {
      "text": "Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to assess differences between the control, aMCI, and dementia groups in continuous measures such as age and years of education. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in the distribution of categorical variables such as sex, race, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. Statistical significance for demographic comparisons was set at p  0.05.\nAll raw continuous values (diffusion measures, adjusted-GM volumes and cognitive scores) were converted to z-scores for statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were adjusted for age (model 1) with further adjustment for sex in secondary models (model 2). Because GM volume was previously adjusted for eTIV, primary analyses and inferences are based on findings from model 1. Other demographic factors, such as education and APOE ε4 status, had no effect on outcome measures and were excluded as covariates. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were created assessing the effect of cognitive group on FA and MD for CV, CD, and CST. Post hoc Tukeys Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test was performed for significant model 1 results.\nMultiple linear regression models were used to assess associations between WM integrity (FAMD of CD and CV) and volume of selected ROIs (PFC, MTL, and RSC), as well as to assess the predictive power of WM integrity and volume of GM ROI in relation to cognitive performance. Beta (β) coefficients were calculated for every standard deviation (SD) increase in volume; thus, the positive β coefficients associated with FA illustrate that larger ROI volumes are expected with higher FA. Likewise, negative β coefficients reflect that larger ROI volumes are expected with lower MD. This same relationship applies between measures of cognitive function and measures of WM integrity. ANOVAs, ANCOVAs, and chi-squared testing were performed in JMP Pro V15.2 on a MacBook Pro 2015 running OS version 10.15.7. Stata SE, version 17 for Macintosh (Stata Corp) was used for multiple linear regression analyses and data visualization. Multiple comparisons were corrected for by use of the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini  Hochberg, 1995).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our findings demonstrate that between group differences in participants ranging from cognitively normal controls to aMCI to dementia are specific to the CD and CV pathways, but not to the CST. We sought to build upon these findings by further exploring associations between WM integrity and less explored neighboring regions outside of the hippocampus, such as the entorhinal cortex, RSC, and PFC. Our robust findings highlight the widespread number of ROI that show atrophy in association with decreases in WM integrity of the cingulum. Furthermore, we report functionally significant associations exist between WM integrity of the CV pathway, volume of MTL ROIs, and memory. Such findings persisted, even after accounting for GM atrophy, which adds to existing literature that has highlighted how integrity of the cingulum relates to cognition (Fan et al., 2019;Kantarci et al., 2011;Mayo et al., 2019;Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012;Shao et al., 2019). Altogether, a primary interpretation of these findings may be that the cingulum, although segmented as having distinct dorsal and ventral pathways, is truly a circuitous pathway connecting the PFC to the hippocampus through the parietal and temporal lobes. Our findings suggest that weakening of any of these structural components may be related to the progression of ADRD.\nAs predicted, group differences in diffusion measures of WM integrity were shown in both cingulum pathways in the expected directions: lower FA and higher MD between clinical groups (dementia  aMCI  control). These changes did not extend to the CST thereby affirming that these are not ubiquitous WM changes in the brain. These findings extend those of previous studies which have shown between cognitive group differences in FA and MD of the cingulum (Lee et al., 2015;Mito et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2019;Tucholka et al., 2018). When sex was added to the models, cognitive group differences in FA of the CV were mitigated. Greater FA of the CV was shown in females relative to males. We are not aware of other studies that have reported this sex difference in WM integrity of the cingulum, thus it is possible this finding was a characteristic of the study sample.\nPost hoc testing revealed that the mean value of all four measures (FA of CD, MD of CD, FA of CV, and MD of CV) were significantly different between control-dementia groups. However, the differences between control-aMCI and aMCI-dementia groups were contrary to our hypothesis which suggested that changes in the CV and MTL ROI would occur in earlier stages of dementia. Meanwhile our results showed differences in FA of the CD between control-aMCI groups and differences in MD of the CV between aMCI-dementia groups. Interestingly, an Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study using a previous release of TRACULA showed changes in FA and MD of the cingulum-angular bundle (analogous to the CV pathway) existed between all three groups (e.g. control-AD, control-MCI, and MCI-AD). Unlike the present study, no differences were reported between the three groups in the cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle (analogous to the CD pathway) (Lee et al., 2015). This may reflect group differences between the cohorts sampled (ADNI vs. BU-ADRC) among other reasons. Nonetheless, these findings are important as we continue to build upon our understanding of the sequence of changes in a region with strong functional and anatomical implications in the progression of ADRD.\nOur findings showing associations between WM tracts and volume of GM ROI widely supported the predictions of our second hypothesis. Further, these findings revealed that associations between WM integrity and GM volume were more widespread than originally predicted. In addition to hypothesized associations, MD of the CV showed negative relationships with volume of all three PFC ROIs and both FA and MD of the CD showed significant associations with hippocampal volume. Our findings that show associations between hippocampal volume with diffusion measures of both cingulum pathways are similar to those reported in the ADNI-TRACULA study by Lee and colleagues (Lee et al., 2015). Unexpectedly, our results did not show any significant associations between volume of the entorhinal cortex andor RSC with WM integrity of either cingulum pathway.\nLastly, we sought to incorporate how findings pertaining to structure, as represented by WM integrity and GM volume, predict cognitive function. First, we hypothosized that WM integrity of the CD and volume of PFC ROIs would predict executive function. This prediction was based upon the historical view that declines in executive function are the direct result of neurodegeneration in the PFC (West, 1996). Interestingly, we saw no relationship between diffusion measures of the CD, GM volume of PFC ROIs, and executive function. The second part of our prediction, stating that WM integrity of the CV and volume of MTL ROIs would predict memory performance, was supported by our findings. Furthermore, associations between WM integrity and memory existed even when volume of either the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex was accounted for in the models. The positive association between WM integrity of the CV, GM volume of both MTL ROIs, and memory performance is consistent with previous studies that have studied relationships between these measures (Ezzati et al., 2016;Jacobs et al, 2018;Kantarci et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2017). These findings highlight potential areas of interest to monitor in aging adults in the progression of ADRD. The basis of the counterintuitive association between WM integrity of the CV and volume of RSC with executive function remains unclear, although our recurring null findings concerning the RSC may suggest that volume of this region is not as sensitive to WM changes in the cingulum as we hypothesized.\nA conclusion from our findings, specific to our final two hypotheses, is the observation that that MD may be a more sensitive measure than FA based upon the number of relationships shown between either pathway and volume of GM ROIs. The associations observed between MD of CV with memory function were further unique to measures of diffusivity (as opposed to anisotropy) and the ventral pathway. This is interesting because while FA is a more forthright measure for assessing integrity of the WM, others in the field have argued that MD is more sensitive to detecting fiber tract alterations (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Mayo et al., 2019).",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "Although we based our primary inferences on model 1, we acknowledge the additional influence sex may have on structural measures such as WM integrity, GM volume, and cognitive performance. We initially saw a sex difference in FA of the CV indicating females had higher FA than males. It appears this difference was further illustrated in subsequent multiple linear regression models adjusted for sex (e.g. there were instances when the associations between structural measures with one another or with cognition were mitigated in model 2). Since there does not seem to be consensus as to sex differences in WM integrity of the cingulum (Lawrence et al., 2021;Cox et al., 2016), we are hopeful future work can build upon our findings and continue to examine this important area of research as it pertains to ADRD risk.\nNext, whereas the sample size (n  241) is a strength of the present study, this precluded us from being able to manually check all Freesurfer and TRACULA segmentations for accuracy. Furthermore, not all 241 participants had measures of memory and executive function and thus models examining cognition had smaller sample sizes than the imaging sample. Lastly, while we had access to structural MRI, HARDI, and cognitive data, we did not have access to other AD biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) measures of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau. The addition of this data could provide valuable insight as to how the presence of Aβ and tau are potentially impacting WM integrity, volume in GM ROIs, and cognitive function.",

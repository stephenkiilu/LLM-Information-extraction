    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) are important diffusion MRI techniques for detecting microstructure abnormities in diseases such as Alzheimers. The advantages of DKI over DTI have been reported generally; however, the indistinct relationship between diffusivity and kurtosis has not been clearly revealed in clinical settings. In this study, we hypothesize that the combination of diffusivity and kurtosis in DKI improves the capacity of DKI to detect Alzheimers disease compared with diffusivity or kurtosis alone. Specifically, a support vector machine-based approach was applied to combine diffusivity and kurtosis and to compare different indices datasets. Strict assessments were conducted to ensure the reliability of all classifiers. Then, data from the optimized classifiers were used to detect abnormalities. With the combination, high accuracy performances of 96.23 were obtained in 53 subjects, including 27 Alzheimers patients. More highly scored abnormal regions were selected by the combination than alone. The results revealed that more precise diffusivity and complementary kurtosis mainly contributed to the high performance of the combination in DKI. This study provides further understanding of DKI and the relationship between diffusivity and kurtosis in pathologic white matter alterations in Alzheimers disease.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Structural changes in brains affected by Alzheimers disease (AD) are important contributors for identifying cognitive decline and pathological developments, including the abnormal diffusion properties of tissues caused by axonal myelin sheath degradation, changed membrane permeability and cerebral atrophy (Chopra et al., 2011;Hahn et al., 2013). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a conventional technique to measure the microstructure of brain tissue and has been widely used in the clinic. However, as only one principle orientation is confirmed in every voxel because of DTIs Gaussian diffusion assumption, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) (Hui et al., 2008;Jensen et al., 2005) has been put forward and developed as one of the new diffusion MRI techniques beyond DTI. DKI is also a comprehensible extension of DTI when kurtosis measurements are additionally introduced as non-Gaussian quantifications for the deviations from Gaussian diffusion. DKI is proposed as being highly sensitive to micro-changes in tissues and has the potential for early diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimers (Cheung et al., 2009;Hui et al., 2008;Struyfs et al., 2015). DKI is increasing in popularity, and clinical research using DKI has been conducted for conditions such as AD (Gong et al., 2014;Yuan et al., 2016), multiple sclerosis (Yoshida et al., 2013), stroke (Weber et al., 2015), prostate cancer (Roethke et al., 2015), Parkinsons disease (Giannelli et al., 2012) and traumatic brain injury (Zhuo et al., 2012). Those studies generally support the hypothesis that DKI has greater potential in abnormality detection than DTI with non-Gaussian measurement (Lazar et al., 2008;Lu et al., 2006;Wu and Cheung, 2010). DKI provides kurtosis tensor and diffusion tensor simultaneously, and the kurtosis tensor is assumed to supplement the diffusion tensor in describing the microstructure (Roethke et al., 2015;Weber et al., 2015;Yoshida et al., 2013;Yuan et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the advantages of DKI, including measuring kurtosis and diffusivity, have not been directly clarified. Most research in DKI has performed analyses or comparisons of the diffusivity and kurtosis indices separately. Although a complementary relationship between diffusivity and kurtosis information has been proposed, no direct evidence has demonstrated it clearly and properly. Considering the complementarity, we think that the combination or fusion of these two types of measurements would markedly promote and uncover the potential advantages of DKI from a novel viewpoint.\nMachine Learning (ML)-based approaches have been widely used in the detection of AD based on neuroimaging data. ML can capture and uncover the multivariate relationships or patterns among high-dimensional features. ML is also a powerful tool for computational automatic diagnosis (CAD) that can improve prediction accuracy by complementing the neuropsychological assessments performed by expert clinicians (Alves et al., 2015;Blockx et al., 2012;Nakaaki et al., 2013). Furthermore, ML is particularly sensitive to the distribution of disease-specific changes hidden within image data, which are difficult to identify using conventional single index statistics (Blockx et al., 2012). Thus, an ML-based approach can be used to combine diffusivity and kurtosis in pathologic detection. Additionally, to our knowledge, there is no DKI research underway using an ML-based approach in the diagnosis of any nervous system disease.\nThe following hypothesis is addressed in this paper: the fusion or combination of diffusivity and kurtosis information in DKI improves the sensitivity and specificity of detecting AD compared with diffusivity or kurtosis alone. There were 53 subjects (27 Alzheimers patients and 26 normal healthy controls) and 23 manually defined regions of interest (ROIs) involved in this study. To investigate how multiple indices of diffusivity or kurtosis can be used in conjunction, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ML approach was adopted for the classification of control and AD subjects. Several aspects of the classifier were considered to access reliability and pathological relevance, including classification accuracies, permutation tests, receiver operator characteristic curves and regression analyses. We first compared the performance of diffusivity indices derived from DTI and DKI. Second, we analyzed the difference in pathological detection between diffusivity and kurtosis alone. Third, we expected that the combination of diffusivity and kurtosis with an SVM-based approach would reach a dramatic performance in pathological detection.",

      "text": "A total of 56 participants, 29 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 27 age-matched normal controls (NCs), were recruited. The approval to carry out the study was obtained from the ethics committee of Tianjin First Central Hospital, China. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Human Research Committee guidelines, and all AD patients were informed and provided their consent with the help of their families or guardians. The examination of every participant included an informative interview, medical history, structural MRI and neuropsychological assessment test, consisting of the cognitive behavioral assessment scale of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, Chinese version, education corrected), Montreal Cognitive (MOCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The cognitive profiles of the AD patients were assessed using a battery of validated neuropsychological tests. The inclusion criteria for the AD group were as follows: (i) the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD; and (ii) cognitive assessment scales with MMSE23, MOCA  26, 1CDR2. The inclusion criteria for the normal control group were as follows: (i) no evidence of dementia or MCI; and (ii) MMSE 26, MOCA26, CDR0. All the participants were additionally examined for the absence of vascular and mixed dementia, depression and anxiety using the Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS)  4, Hamilton Depression Scale  7 and Hamilton Anxiety Scale  6. Two AD patients were excluded because of incompatibility with the inclusion criteria. One of the normal controls was removed because of subject head motion. Finally, 27 AD and 26 normal control cases were included. The demographic and neuropsychological information of the AD and NC groups in this paper is shown in Table 1.",

      "text": "For strict control of the image quality, several examinations were conducted. First, a visual quality assurance (QA) check (2 years of experience) on all data was conducted to check for gross image artifacts, such as Venetian blinds and severe slice dropouts covering more than half of a slice. After the visual check, an automated QA was also performed by running a slice-wise correlation check within the software DTIPrep (Oguz et al., 2014). This test detects intensity abnormalities andor motion between different gradients and interleaved parts within one gradient image volume (Oguz et al., 2014). One normal control sample was rejected in this automated QA procedure. Subsequently, eddy current and motion correction were performed using FSL-eddy (FMRIB Software Library v5.0, Oxford, UK, http: www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl) (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2015;Jenkinson et al., 2012). The quality of the eddy-current and motioncorrected images was considered satisfactory if the residual motion was below 2 mm for translation and 0.5 degrees for rotation between consecutive DWIs (Liu et al., 2010). In the eddy procedure of FSL, the b-matrix was reoriented after motion correction to match the affine registration for more accurate tensor estimations (Leemans and Jones, 2009). Then, DKE (diffusion kurtosis estimation, http: academicdepartments.musc.educbidkidke.html) software was used for DKI indices calculation. As reported in Van Hecke et al. (2010), the Gaussian kernel-smoothing filter can maintain specificity. All images were smoothed with an FWHM of 2.25 mm (1.25 times the voxel size).\nAccording to previous methods (Cheung et al., 2009;Hui et al., 2008), DKI-derived kurtosis parameters (mean kurtosis, MK; axial kurtosis, AK; and radial kurtosis, RK) and diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, MD; axial diffusivity, AxD; radial diffusivity, RD; and fractional anisotropy, FA) (Fig. 1) were calculated (Cheung et al., 2009;Hui et al., 2008) with the 61 volumes in the DKE software (diffusion kurtosis estimation, http:academicdepartments.musc.edu cbidkidke.html) using the CLLS-QP (constrained linear least squaresconvex quadratic programming) algorithm (Lazar et al., 2008). Addi- tionally, DTI indices (MD, AxD, RD and FA) were estimated with the B0 and 30 b1000 smm 2 images in FSL.",

    "Defining regions of interest": {
      "text": "With extensive reviewing of the previous literature for AD based on DTI or DKI, 23 typical ROIs were selected and manually defined. All ROIs were drawn on the 3D-T1, color-encoded FA and MD images. All ROIs were drawn twice, with more than two months apart for each drawing, by one experienced neuroradiologist with five years of MRI experience and supervised by another two neuroradiologists with seven years of experience.\nThe drawing incorporated the anatomical regions, including the white matter of the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe and temporal lobe (Stěpán-Buksakowska et al., 2012), the corpus callosum (body, splenium, and genu) (Hong et al., 2013), the white matter of the cingulum bundle (anterior, central, and posterior) (Hong et al., 2013;Zhuang et al., 2012) and the posterior limb of the bilateral internal capsule (Nakaaki et al., 2013), the hippocampus (Hong et al., 2013;Selnes and Aarsland, 2013) and the thalamus (Niida et al., 2013;van Bruggen et al., 2012). The exact locations for each ROI were referenced to these corresponding previous studies. As the morphological differences and the severe brain atrophy in the elderly would lead to errors or variation in spatial normalization across subjects (Battaglini et al., 2011), manually drawn ROIs in the native space helped obtain more precise measurements for the specific regions and avoided the impact of spatial misregistration. All 23 anatomically defined regions were placed in TrackVis (http:trackvis.org) and delineated in three sequential slices. Fig. 2 shows these ROIs drawn in the background of 3D-T1 images weighted by FA values. Observers were blinded for group labels while drawing and verifying ROIs. The mean ROI signals for each index of all subjects were extracted. Observer variation was evaluated by paired T-tests and the interclass correlation between the ROI size and the extracted FA value across 23 ROIs. No significant difference was found with all paired T-tests, and the interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (McGraw and Wong, 1996) of 23 ROIs were 0.889  0.054 for ROI size and 0.907  0.036 for FA, which were both high. Agreement plots were drawn to determine the reliability of the ROI drawings (Fig. 3).",

      "text": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are algorithms that learn how to assign labels to objects (Burges, 1998) and have been successfully used in the field of neuroscience (Mwangi et al., 2015;Orru et al., 2012;Wee et al., 2011). Linear models were used to implement nonlinear class boundaries via transforming the input data into a new higher dimensional space (Fig. 4a). Following transformation, a linear model called the maximum margin hyperplane is created to obtain the greatest separation between the classes. The hyperplane describes a straight line in a high dimensional space to separate the classes (Fig. 4b). The instances that are closest to the maximum margin hyperplane are called support vectors. The maximum margin hyperplane is relatively stable, as it only moves if the training instances that are added or deleted are support vectors.\nTwo types of supervised feature ranking techniques (Mwangi et al., 2014) were utilized: SVM-based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) (Calderoni et al., 2012;Castro et al., 2011;Davatzikos et al., 2008;Marquand et al., 2011) and correlation coefficients with MMSE scores (CORR-MMSE) (Chu et al., 2012;Davatzikos et al., 2008;Graña et al., 2011;Wee et al., 2011). SVM-RFE ranks features by the contribution of each feature for classification. A high contribution is defined by a large difference in the accuracy before and after each features elimination. The CORR-MMSE ranks features by the absolute value of Pearsons correlation coefficient between each feature and MMSE scores. Top features, regardless of the method, indicate the features greater relevance in discriminating between classes.\nIn this paper, SVM-based machine learning analysis was undertaken using the LIBSVM toolbox (MATLAB version 3.21, http:www.csie.ntu. edu.twcjlinlibsvm) (Chang and Lin, 2011) The entire classification procedure was nested cross-validation (CV) (Huang et al., 2007), primarily including an outer CV and an inner CV loop. For each well-prepared feature dataset, the same procedure was conducted (Fig. 5). During the outer leave-one-out CV procedure, the training and testing procedures were repeated until each subject was tested as testing data. During each of these repeated procedures, all features were ranked by the two methods mentioned above. Then, the performance for each subset was calculated: the top M0 features were successively selected to train a classifier until that M0 had a value from one to the dimension of all features. An inner CV loop was conducted on each subset for optimal model parameters. The criterion that the classifier or feature subset with the highest performance was considered the best and the subset with the least number of features was selected when more than one subset achieved the highest performance was followed. Then, this best classifier was tested on the fresh testing data.\nA multivariate SVM (Zhang et al., 2006) classifier was used with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The RBF kernel used two parameters: C and γ. C represented the errortrade-off parameter that adjusts the importance of the separation error in the creation of the separation surface. γ represented the width of the radial basis function.\nTo estimate suitable values for C and γ, we used a grid search in the range of C2 -3 , 2 -2 , , 2 8 and γ 2 -12 , 2 -11 , , 2 -1 performed for each feature subset separately. For fitting the best model, a series of leave-one-out CVs of the training subset were conducted as an inner CV in the grid search loops. The parameters that gave the classifiers the highest performance in the grid search loops were used to build models on the feature subset.",

A p-value was calculated as the probability when the accuracy with randomized labels was higher than that of the optimized classifier within the 1000 randomizations. In addition, for diagnosis and pathological evaluating, the decision values of the testing data were further examined with Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROCs) and linearly correlated with the MMSE scores with Pearsons correlation coefficient. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated in the ROC analysis, with values between 0.5 and 1, where a higher AUC meant a higher performance in the diagnosis.",

    "The higher performance of DKI-derived diffusivity indices": {
      "text": "It is important to note that the DKI-based estimation of the diffusion tensor can be similarly employed as DTI estimates. Lanzafame and colleagues (Lanzafame et al., 2016) recently provided a quantification of the model-dependent effect (differences in the diffusivity indices estimation by employing the DKI vs. DTI models) by using a high quality, gold standard discovery dataset (HCP), and successively demonstrated that confusing true conventional DTI with diffusion tensor invariants estimated by fitting the DKI model to multi-shell DW data is not merely a theoretical concern. They also concluded that model-dependent differences in the estimation of diffusivity indices can be well beyond commonly seen disease-related alterations and estimating diffusion tensor-derived indices using the DKI model may be advantageous in terms of mitigating b-value dependence of diffusivity estimates. Veraart et al. suggested that DKI models provide a more accurate parameterization of both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion components compared with DTI (Veraart et al., 2011). They also mentioned that the DKI model provided a b-value-independent estimation of the widely used diffusion tensor parameters. This model- The practical results indicated a significant difference between them, which was also observed in previous applications (Giannelli et al., 2012;Roethke et al., 2015;Weber et al., 2015;Yoshida et al., 2013). To place the results in perspective, one of the most frequently used criteria for AD classification, the NINCDS-ARDA guidelines, had a sensitivity of 81 and a specificity of 70 (Knopman et al., 2001). Much research has focused on improving the automatic classification performance using various methods (Aguilar et al., 2013;Graña et al., 2011;ODwyer et al., 2012;Wee et al., 2011). Graña reported classification accuracy in the range of 97-100 for FA and 92-98 for MD based on a DTI dataset of 45 subjects with a voxel approach covering the entire brain (Graña et al., 2011). With the limited brain coverage, the performance of diffusivity indices datasets in this study was notable.\nIn this paper, Diff-DKI had a higher sensitivity to AD-related abnormities than Diff-DTI in automatic detection. The detected abnormal regions of the two diffusivity indices included the hippocampus and the posterior cingulum bundle, which are important damaged and highly reported regions in AD (Hong et al., 2013). Diff-DKI showed more regions such as the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum and the anterior cingulum bundle than Diff-DTI, as shown in Fig. 6. The effect size map in Fig. 8 also supported that Diff-DKI had a higher ES in the corpus callosum. These Alzheimers related regions were also widely reported in previous studies (Graña et al., 2011;ODwyer et al., 2012;Wee et al., 2011). The abnormities shown by the diffusivity indices could be explained by the demyelination of axons, the loss of neurons and the increase in the activity of water channels, thus reducing the bonding of water to the membrane during diffusion. Increases in diffusivity indices revealing less diffusion restriction were highly sensitive to the microstructural changes in AD (Hsu et al., 2015;Keihaninejad et al., 2013;Stebbins and Murphy, 2010). The higher performance of Diff-DKI at the dataset level suggested a more accurate prediction of diffusion tensors for the changed microstructures.",

    "Complementary information from kurtosis": {
      "text": "Although the classification results for the kurtosis indices were close to those of Diff-DTI and lower than those of Diff-DKI, sufficient clues suggested that kurtosis was more predictive for abnormalities than diffusivity indices. First, a higher ES for kurtosis indices than diffusivity indices in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the thalamus were clearly observed in Fig. 6. Second, there were obvious regions selected by the ROI tally of kurtosis indices alone that were missed in the scoring of diffusivity indices. In Fig. 6, the scores with SVM-RFE ranking provided high scores in the occipital white matter and the scores with CORR-MMSE ranking selected the splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule, which were missed in the scoring of diffusivity indices. We concluded that different regions are more predictive of the condition in different parametric maps and this presented a different sensitivity effect of matrices in pathological detection. Previous research reported similar results, that kurtosis could provide some important abnormal regions, such as the cingulum, the hippocampus, and the corpus callosum and limb of the internal capsule (Roethke et al., 2015;Weber et al., 2015;Wu and Cheung, 2010;Yoshida et al., 2013). However, the hippocampus was missed in the scoring of kurtosis but not in the diffusivity matrices. Possible reasons were that the serious deposition of amyloid may increase the microstructure complexity, which can be represented by the level of kurtosis (Kitamura et al., 2013;Vanhoutte et al., 2013;Yuan et al., 2016). The exact meaning or pathological basis of kurtosis remains unclear because of its higher order effects beyond common physical intuition, which is unlike the explicit pathologic meanings revealed by diffusivity. To date, the complexity of the microstructure has generally been considered as a general interpretation of kurtosis (Zhuo et al., 2012). Tissues, such as gray matter or neural fibers, contain various types of biological structures comprising complex microenvironments for water diffusion. When damage, such as degeneration or deposition of amyloid plaques occurred, the well-organized and complex microstructures changed as well as the relevant kurtosis value. However, this abnormally changing direction was not determinate because the deposition of amyloid and tissue degradation could both occur in the Alzheimers brain, leading to two opposite effects for kurtosis: increasing values of kurtosis (Giannelli et al., 2012;Roethke et al., 2015;Szczepankiewicz et al., 2013) and possibly decreasing values (Weber et al., 2015;Yoshida et al., 2013). In Fig. 9, both pathological trends of kurtosis with MMSE are clearly observed. The degeneration in the corpus callosum decreased its kurtosis, but the accumulation of amyloid plaques was related to increasing kurtosis (Kitamura et al., 2013;Vanhoutte et al., 2013). Both the increase and the decrease of kurtosis contained underlying changes depending on the diseases or micro-structures and suggested that abundant information about the microstructure can be provided by kurtosis. From these considerations, this wide range of pathological detection of kurtosis could probably provide more information than diffusivity.",

    "Combination of diffusivity and kurtosis": {
      "text": "DKI provided both diffusivity and kurtosis data, which were combined using ML approaches that then obtained the highest performance in this study. The selected ROIs from All-DKI absolutely included all high scorers from the other three methods: Diff-DTI, Diff-DKI, and Kur-DKI. The higher performance of All-DKI indices was also reflected by a higher selection of abnormal ROIs combining the results of kurtosis and diffusivity. Previous clinical applications also supported the advantages of DKI, wherein DKI could find more abnormal regions than DTI (Gong et al., 2014;Roethke et al., 2015;Weber et al., 2015;Wu and Cheung, 2010;Yoshida et al., 2013;Yuan et al., 2016), but without using a multiple indices mixed dataset-based classification analysis.\nSeveral elements contributed to the high performance of the combination of kurtosis and diffusivity. The previous two discussion sections explained the basic two elements: accurate estimated diffusivity and additional information from kurtosis, which were also mentioned in previous studies (Graña et al., 2011;Veraart et al., 2011). DKI provided both Gaussian and non-Gaussian measurements in the modeling estimation, whereas DTI measured tissue properties that confused them. For the properties of diffusion, the diffusivity provides a description of the Gaussian component and kurtosis describes the non-Gaussian component (Palombo et al., 2015;Szczepankiewicz et al., 2013). The additional high b-value in DKI, 2000 smm 2 , added more specific microstructural information and sensitivity to pathological damage. High b-value diffusion weighted imaging has high sensitivity to the real diffusion or the microstructure (Meng et al., 2013;Veraart et al., 2011). Multi-shell acquisition with multi b-values could also obtain precise reconstruction of nerve microstructure (Meng et al., 2013;Szczepankiewicz et al., 2013). Palombo suggested the concomitant and complementary existence of a multi-compartmentalized diffusion process and magnetic susceptibility (quantified by T2-star) in DKI contrast that might explain why the kurtosis contrast is more sensitive than DTI in discriminating between different tissues (Palombo et al., 2015). By fitting the non-Gaussian and Gaussian process in one model, kurtosis and diffusivity matrices from DKI provided two perspectives on microstructures (Lee et al., 2013). Only by combining both of them could the whole picture of the microstructure be presented.\nThe signal-to-noise-ratio is an important factor that can strongly influence the accuracy of estimated indices, especially in the DKI model. This phenomenon has been shown both experimentally (Giannelli et al., 2011;Meng et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2015) and theoretically (André et al., 2014;Giannelli and Toschi, 2016). Several preprocessing methods and algorithms have also been promoted to avoid the noise effect on the indices estimation (André et al., 2014;Giannelli et al., 2011;Zhou et al., 2015). Rather than introducing new processing methods as well as additional biases, treating the comparison between DTI and DKI with the traditional and commonly used preprocessing steps would be better for interpreting the differences. Even so, we processed the images with great caution by a strict two-step pre-examination and the most recommended workflow. In addition, with the ICC as high as approximately 0.9, this guaranteed the reliability of ROI measurements, which reduced spatial mistakes such as atrophy. With this considerate and careful processing, we feel that the noise effect in metric estimation has been properly treated.\nThis study is limited in sample size. In addition, subjects with prodromal Alzheimers disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were not included to assess the performance of DKI for early detection of the disease or prediction of conversion from MCI to dementia. We think that DKI has promising potential in the early diagnosis of disease and more clinical research will add more interpretations for DKI. Approaches such as voxel-based analysis based on large data samples or multi-modal neuroimaging data will be helpful to obtain a deeper understanding of DKI in pathological representation. Additionally, many machine learning studies of DTI have been performed on multicenter datasets, which have not been performed for DKI; this aspect was important for the DKI clinical application.",

      "text": "In this paper, an SVM-based machine learning approach was used for the pathological detection of Alzheimers disease by combining diffusivity and kurtosis measurements. Unlike previous research on DKI applications focusing on a single analysis of indices or some multiple regressions, the SVM-based machine approaches conducted analysis at the dataset level, which explored the high capacity of DKI in Alzheimers automated detection. The combination of diffusivity and kurtosis measurements from DKI significantly yielded high performance in the pathological automatic detection of Alzheimers disease. In particular, the more precise diffusivity and complementary kurtosis data were examined to contribute to the high performance of their fusion, and the white matter abnormalities were properly identified for Alzheimers research.",

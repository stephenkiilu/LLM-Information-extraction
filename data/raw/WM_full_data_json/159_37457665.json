    "abstract": "Median and peak height of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) markers used to quantify white matter microstructure changes. We examine the association of DTI histogram-derived measures in global normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and cognitive decline in patients with normal cognition and cognitive impairment no dementia from a memory clinic in Singapore. Methods: A total of 252 patients (mean age: 71.1  7.6 years, 53.2 women) were included. All patients underwent clinical assessments, a brain MRI scan at baseline, and neuropsychological assessments annually for 2 years. DTI scans were processed to obtain MD and FA histogram-derived measures. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Canadian Stroke Network harmonization neuropsychological battery were used to assess cognitive function. Linear regression models with generalised estimating equation (GEE) and logistic regression models were used to examine the association between DTI histogram measures and cognitive decline. Results: When compared to baseline, MD and FA measures at Year 2 were associated with an accelerated worsening in global cognition (all p for interaction 0.001; Year 0 vs 2, MD median: -0.29 (95CI: -0.49, -0.09) vs -0.45 (95CI: -0.65,-0.25); MD peak height: 0.22 (95CI: 0.07, 0.37) vs 0.37 (95CI: 0.21, 0.53); FA median: 0.11 (95CI: -0.05, 0.26) vs 0.22 (95CI: 0.07, 0.37); FA peak height: -0.14 (95CI: -0.28, 0.00) vs -0.24 (95 CI: -0.38, -0.10);). Similar findings were observed for executive function and visuomotor speed while only MD measures predicted worsening in memory domain. Interpretation: This study shows that DTI histogram measures are associated with accelerated cognitive decline suggesting the utility of DTI as a pre-clinical marker in predicting the worsening of cognition in clinical trials.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Memory clinic patients at risk for dementia often present with visible lesions, characteristic of late-stage brain injury 1. Vascular lesions measured using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers include white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes and microbleeds 2,3 which are recognized as an important contributor to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) 4,5 and increase the probability of developing clinical symptoms of dementia, including Alzheimers disease pathology 6. VCI is associated with modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that VCI could be preventable 7. Hence it is important to assess vascular imaging measures and their potential role as biomarkers.\nIt is difficult to directly assess brain vascular pathology, particularly small vessel disease (SVD), in vivo 8. Therefore, surrogate measures such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been utilised. DTI reveals disruption within brain networks by quantifying subtle changes in white matter (WM) microstructure 9 and is particularly sensitive to WM damage in small vessel disease 10. Normal appearing white matter (NAWM) microstructure could be investigated using DTI, with WMH displaying reduced NAWM integrity, depending on the proximity to WM lesions 11,12. There are several quantitative DTI markers. Median and peak height of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are DTI markers derived from histogram analysis of the NAWM, with FA and MD measuring the directionality and magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in tissue respectively 13. Axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) are also DTI markers correlated with axonal and myelin damage 14. MD and FA were found to be correlated to age-related cognitive decline, 15 and are more sensitive to WM damage than WMH lesions load 16. A greater understanding regarding the association between NAWM and cognitive decline is required.\nPrevious single and multi-center cross-sectional studies have reported associations between DTI measures and impaired cognitive function, not only in regions of WM abnormalities but also in NAWM regions, in populations such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and community-based cohorts 171819. DTI measures have also shown to be strongly associated with vascular-related cognitive deficits such as executive function and processing speed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, 20 supporting their use as pre-clinical markers in SVD. Additionally, even in shorter periods of 1-3 years, changes in DTI have been detected in SVD patients, 21,22 further reinforcing the potential utility of DTI measures even in smaller sample sizes as previously shown in the OPtimising mulTImodal MRI markers for use as surrogate markers in trials of Vascular Cognitive Impairment due to cerebrAl small vesseL disease (OPTIMAL) study 23 Despite these findings, there is limited longitudinal data analyzing the association of DTI measures in NAWM with individual cognitive trajectories 20. The study aims to fill this gap by examining the association between baseline DTI measures assessing NAWM tissue integrity and cognition in memory clinic patients consisting of normal cognition and cognitive impairment in longitudinal analysis. The focus on longitudinal analysis over a two-year follow-up period distinguishes this study from previous research. We hypothesize that baseline DTI measures predicts for cognitive decline, over two years of follow-up in a memory clinic cohort.",

Briefly, elderly patients were recruited into the cohort if they had one of the following diagnoses at baseline: 1) No Cognitive Impairment (NCI): patients with no functional loss and cognitive impairment on the formal neuropsychological testing; 2) Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (CIND): patients with no loss of daily functions and no neuroimaging evidence of cerebral infarction but impairment in at least one cognitive domain on formal neuropsychological testing; 3) Vascular CIND (VCIND): patients with neuroimaging evidence of cerebral infarction, a history of ischemic stroke within past 6-24 months and evidence of impairment on neuropsychological tests; 4) Dementia: patients who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for dementia.\nFrom 12 August 2010 till 27 December 2016, a total of 554 patients were recruited into the memory clinic cohort (Fig. 1). For this study, we excluded patients with dementia at baseline (n  211). Of these 343 NCI and (V)CIND patients, 265 had available DTI data, after excluding patients with incomplete MRI data (n  78). A further eight patients who had poor quality DTI images at baseline and five patients with missing neuropsychological data were excluded, leaving a final sample size of 252 patients for analysis.\nEthical approval was obtained from the National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Review Board and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained in the preferred language of the patients.",

Baseline MRI scans were visually graded by experienced researchers (BG and SH) who were blinded to the patients clinical history. Vascular lesions of cerebral small vessel disease were graded according to STRIVE (Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging) criteria. WMH were defined based on their hyperintensity in periventricular or deep WM regions on FLAIR images and categorised using the Fazekas scale (none, punctate (mild), beginning of confluence (moderate) or confluent areas (severe) areas) 25. As the sample size of patients without WMH was very small (less than five), WMH was dichotomised into either none-mild or moderate-severe. Lacunes were defined as hypointense lesions (3-15 mm diameter) with hyperintense rims on FLAIR images 26. Cerebral microbleeds were defined as hypointense lesions (10 mm diameter) with blooming effect on SWI 26",

High-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI was acquired using magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (192 continuous sagittal slices, TRTETI23001.9900 ms, flip angle9  , isotropic voxel size1.0 mm 3 ). NAWM histogram measures (i.e., MD median and peak height, FA median and peak height), were computed. The DTI analysis pipeline has been described previously 19. Briefly, the eddy correct software from the FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox, (http:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwikiFDT) was employed for DTI preprocessing. MD and FA maps were created with DTIFIT. FLAIR to T1-weighted and T1-weighted to b0 registrations were performed and the affine transformation matrices were concatenated to produce a FLAIR-to-DTI transformation. Tissue Probability Maps were registered into DTI space using these transformations. Hard segmentations were applied to generate maps of tissue classes, achieved by voxel-wise comparison of the gray matter, WM and cerebrospinal fluid Tissue Probability Maps, with each voxel being assigned to the highest probability tissue class. To identify NAWM, T1-weighed structural images and T2-weighed FLAIR images were registered to the b0 image using 12 parameter affine registration with a normalised mutual information cost function. These transformations were applied to WMH lesion masks. NAWM in DTI was classified as non-lesion voxels where the probability of WM was greater than gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid 16. Histogram analysis was conducted on the MD and FA maps in NAWM regions. Summary histogram measures were derived from normalized histograms with 1000 bins (bin width: 0.004mm 2 s -1 10 -3 ; range: 0-4 mm 2 s -1 10 -3 ) 30. The DTI histogram-derived measures were standardised to their mean and standard deviation (SD) for each DTI measure.",

GEE was performed for global cognition and the six cognitive domains as outcomes in all patients. The coefficient estimates and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.\nTo determine the frequency of patients with cognitive decline in each cognitive outcome, we calculated the change in z-score for each patient from Year 2 and Year 0. If the change in score was negative, cognitive decline was considered present else cognitive decline was considered absent. The mean and SD for change in z-score were provided for the study population and for a subset of patients with negative change in zscores in each cognitive outcome.\nTo further determine the association between baseline DTI measures and cognitive decline, we applied the logistic regression model and reported the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95 CIs. Cognitive decline was coded as 1 if there was a decrease in cognitive scores from baseline to Year 2, else 0.\nFor global cognitive scores, p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To account for family-wise error rate for the cognitive domains that made up the global cognition score and the combination of measures (median and peak height) for each DTI measure, the Bonferroni correction was applied. P-values of less than 0.05 (6  2)  0.0042 were deemed as statistically significant.\nThree models were built for each combination of DTI histogramderived measures and cognition scores. Model I was a univariable analysis unadjusted for any confounders. For Model II, we adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, and baseline diagnosis) and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking history). In Model III, we further adjusted the model for MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease (WMH, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and total brain volume). For the GEE analysis, all three models included adjustment for follow-up time. An additional analysis was conducted that included the interaction between follow-up time and each DTI measure to assess whether the effects of DTI measures were the same across time. For the interaction analysis, interaction Pvalues of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Using Model III, cognitive trajectories over time were presented visually by plotting the estimated marginal means of the cognition score at baseline, year 1 and year 2 with the baseline DTI measure specified at 1 SD and at the mean.\nTo calculate the ratio of the absolute mean difference in the cognitive z-scores between Year 2 and Year 0 of baseline DTI measures with significant time interaction, delta method was used. The ratios and their corresponding 95 CIs were reported. Similarly, ratios with P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using STATA (Stata Version17, StataCorp, College Station, TX).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this current study, NAWM microstructure using baseline DTI histogram-derived measures were significantly associated with worse cognition over time. Generally, the associations of MD and FA measures with cognitive score over time became more pronounced in global cognition, executive function and visuomotor speed, suggesting an accelerated worsening of cognition as time progresses even when time has no effect on cognition. Only MD measures predicted worsening of cognition in memory over time. All DTI measures were associated with visuospatial function, with the effect remaining the same over a 2-year follow-up.\nPrevious studies have shown that DTI measures are altered in MCI and dementia 343536. MCI subjects had lower peak height and higher median on the MD histogram, while having higher peak height and lower median on the FA histogram 36. These findings suggest that DTI histogram-derived measures could be used to predict cognitive decline progression in patients with suspected MCI. Although disruption of global WM integrity from normal aging contributes to cognitive decline, 37. WM injury is often presumed to be vascular due to their correlation to ischemia, increasing the likelihood of cognitive impairment 38. It has also been previously shown that brain amyloid β and SVD are independent processes in CIND individuals 39. NAWM have been strongly associated with cognitive decline in visuomotor speed and executive function in our study, but the relationship of NAWM with visuomotor speed is not well-understood. A recent study has found significant changes in NAWM with mobility, where a decrease in NAWM FA volume correlated to a slower gait, contributed by SVD 40. Ischemic damage may have the greatest impact in visuomotor speed domain but further research is warranted.\nCognitive domains known to be affected in VCI included executive function, processing speed and delayed recall of word lists and visual content 41. A study had showed that executive dysfunction was more prominent in early onset of VCI without loss of memory 42. In our study, NAWM microstructure was similarly associated with cognitive deficit in executive function and visuospatial function while cognitive deficit in memory was associated to a lesser extent (only MD measures). This suggests that DTI measures might be a sensitive marker for vascular damage, with ischemic changes causing NAWM tract abnormalities including increased diffusivity magnitude and possible loss of myelin. Network disruption in NAWM could be driven by ischemic processes in multiple cognitive domains prior to the development of visible vascular lesions. Even though there were a greater proportion of NCI and CIND than VCIND in our study population, similar associations of DTI with executive function and visuospatial function were also found in those with SVD in other studies 43,44. However, similar domains are also affected by WM atrophy, 45 which were not adjusted for in our current study.\nThe underlying pathology of DTI measures is not fully understood, but pathology studies have supported MD and FA measures as well as AD and RD to reflect breakdown in WM microstructure 46. The discrepancy in the associations between both measures (MD and FA) with memory and visuomotor speed found in our study suggests that the pathophysiology measured by MD and FA could be different, with similar findings in other studies as well 47. Our finding on memory lends strength to the smaller studies which found only MD to be primarily related to memory 48,49. One study on interstitial cerebral edema had proposed that MD measures, which reflect diffuse changes, could be reversible after treatment, while FA measures were considered irreversible 50. More research is needed on understanding the pathophysiology of MD measures, as it could reveal important targets that could potentially be reversible. Overall, our data suggests utility of DTI histogram-derived measures as a pre-clinical marker to predict the worsening of cognition, where ischemic changes is likely responsible for NAWM damage in MCI.\nOur study has several strengths. Firstly, longitudinal analyses allowed us to associate cognitive scores over time with baseline measurement of NAWM microstructure suggesting changes in NAWM potentially contributes to the worsening of cognition. Secondly, the use of a locally validated neuropsychological test battery provided comprehensive information in multiple cognitive domains. Thirdly, as DTI measures are statistically calculated from diffusion MRI images, its non-invasive and automated nature are major advantages of this technique. DTI histogram-derived measures have shown to be reproducible, with low variability on repeated imaging 51. Whole brain histogram analysis also lends strength in quantifying total disease burden. Lastly, the use of GEE in our analysis to account for repeated measurements of cognition scores, as well as adjustment for various confounders including demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease.\nA main limitation of histogram analysis is the loss of topographic information. Regional information can be recovered if the histogram calculation is led by segmentation using anatomic landmarks 13. In regards to methodological limitations, the findings of this study are restricted to elderly individuals with (V)CIND or NCI in memory clinic settings and may not be generalizable to older people in the general population. Though our study population consisted of individuals with cerebrovascular disease, we were unable to perform analysis separately for small and large vessel disease. This would be of interest for future studies to further delineate the effects of DTI on cognitive decline. There may have been selection bias introduced, whereby there might have been an underestimation of effects on cognition due to restricting analysis to NCI and CIND and excluding those with dementia. DTI measures should be interpreted as an indirect approximation to WM microstructural status 52. Markers should not be used independently, where more than one modality might improve prediction of future dementia. Future studies should include the analysis of other DTI measures and tract specific analysis to further determine their relationship with cognitive decline.\nFor potential clinical applications, individuals with cerebral SVD would benefit greatly from the information on DTI measures, to predict severe sporadic SVD progression, which would likely lead to an eventual conversion to dementia 23. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the potential utility of summary statistics from DTI histogram analysis to detect subtle ischemic changes of NAWM. Our findings provide evidence that baseline DTI measures are associated with cognitive decline, suggesting the potential use of DTI as a pre-clinical marker in predicting the worsening of cognition in clinical trials.\ne The beta-coefficients for baseline DTI measures at each time point (Baseline, Year 1, Year 2) with the interaction terms (DTI measure and time) in the model. : For these cognitive z-score and DTI measure combinations, their DTI effects for each timepoint was non-significant (i.e., p0.0512  0.004 for domainspecific cognitive z-score, and p0.05 for global z-score). Although some the combinations had wide 95CIs, all had p-values  0.05.\n-: For these cognitive z-score and DTI measure combinations, their p-value for interaction were non-significant.

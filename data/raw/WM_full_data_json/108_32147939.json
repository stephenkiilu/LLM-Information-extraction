    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "White matter alterations are common in Alzheimers disease (AD). 1 Although cortical neurodegeneration is a core feature of AD, several lines of research suggest that white matter impairment is part of the pathological cascade in AD. 2345 Brain autopsy studies showed partial loss of axons, reduced myelin, and increased astrogliosis in the white matter in patients with pathological diagnosis of AD. 2,6 White matter hyperintensity volume, a gross radiological marker of white matter 5-10 years before symptom onset. 13 Together these results suggest that white matter alterations occur in circumscribed brain regions at an early pre-symptomatic stage of AD. 14 The deposition of cortical amyloid 𝛽 (A𝛽; henceforth we refer only to cortical A𝛽) precedes the onset of Alzheimers disease (AD) symptoms by 20 years, 15,16 typically beginning within the fourth or fifth decade of life. 17,18 A𝛽 deposition has been associated previously with small vessel disease in the form of capillary cortical amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and arteriosclerosis, 6,19,20 which may entail white matter damage. 6,21,22 These observations suggest that the A𝛽 deposition occurring during middle and older age is associated with accelerated age-related white matter alterations, even though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Results from lifespan diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies suggest maturation of fiber tracts to continue until the fourth decade of life, 23 followed by decline in white matter integrity at a higher age. 232425 Few studies, however, have assessed the association between early accrual of A𝛽 deposition and white matter decline in asymptomatic middle-aged and older adults. 4,26272829 In elderly cognitively normal subjects, higher A𝛽 deposition (as assessed by amyloid PET) was associated with DTI alterations within the splenium 30 and cingulum bundle. 31 In late middle-aged cognitively normal subjects, abnormal levels of A𝛽 have only inconsistently been associated with DTI alterations, 12,27,32,33 probably because the small sample size hampered statistical power. 12,32,33 Therefore, the question remains whether microstructural white matter alterations are associated with early cerebral amyloid deposition. In addition, there are few studies of middle-aged adults and it is not clear at what age these associations can be observed. We addressed these questions using a large sample of participants from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS), including 282 cognitively normal adults from age 30-89, allowing us to examine the association between deposition of A𝛽 and white matter alterations across the adult life span. Based on our previous findings of predominantly posterior parietal alterations of MD in autosomal dominant AD 13 , 13 our primary hypothesis was that A𝛽 deposition is associated with a higher age-related increase of MD, particularly in posterior parietal and long-projecting frontoparietal fiber tracts.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The major results of the current adult life span study in cognitively normal subjects (30-89 years) showed abnormal global A𝛽 deposi-tion (global Florbetapir F-18 PET) to be associated with stronger age-related MD alterations, particularly within the posterior parietal white matter. A𝛽 status was also associated with stronger agerelated increase in global WMH volume, independent of hypertension.\nTogether, these results suggest that A𝛽 deposition is associated with white matter alterations throughout the adult life span in cognitively normal subjects.\nIncreased MD in the posterior parietal white matter included fiber tracts such as the forceps major, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. These fiber tracts connect among others regions of the default mode network (DMN), 47 that is, a major functional network impaired in both cognitively normal subjects with elevated A𝛽 levels 48,49 and patients with AD dementia. 50 White matter alterations in tracts connecting the DMN were shown previously to be associated with reduced functional connectivity in patients with AD, 44 suggesting that white matter The posterior parietal spatial distribution of MD alterations observed in the current study shows a spatial similarity to that previously found in mild AD 51,52 (for review see 53 ), and in subjects with autosomal dominant AD. 13 In autosomal dominant AD, we previously reported higher MD within the forceps major 10 years before symptom onset, with other major long-projecting fibers tracts such as the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and forceps minor affected subsequently. 13 Similarly, in the current study, we observed significant amyloid-related MD increase that was located primarily in temporal and posterior brain regions. It should be noted that the white matter alterations extended to frontal fiber tracts such as the anterior thalamic radiation. Alterations in the frontal white mat-ter, including among other regions the anterior thalamic radiation, have been reported previously in late-onset AD. 54,55 It is thus possible that due to the age difference between autosomal dominant Alzheimers disesae compared to late onset AD, 13 more frontal white matter alterations are present in late-onset AD. Whether regional differences in A𝛽 PET contribute to regionally matching differences in MD alterations was not possible to address in the current study, given that local A𝛽 PET values are highly intercorrelated and thus regional A𝛽 PET changes are difficult to disentangle from global A𝛽 PET changes.\nThe underlying mechanisms of A𝛽-related MD alterations remain unclear. One possibility is that the deposition of A𝛽 enhances small vessel disease, in the form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).\nWhite matter damage in AD might thus be related to vascular mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion (for reviews see 6,56 ). Cerebrovascular and its prevalence is also increased in cognitively normal subjects exhibiting neuritic amyloid plaques. 58 A𝛽 induces vasoconstriction and reduces functional hyperemia, as observed in mouse models of cerebral A𝛽 deposition. 56,59 Furthermore, higher parenchymal A𝛽 may enhance CAA and associated perfusion alterations. 60 Microstructural white matter alterations becoming visible as WMH have been associated\npreviously with small vessel disease changes including capillary CAA and hypoperfusion. 21,61 In the current study, we found higher agerelated increase in WMH volume in subjects with abnormal Florbetapir F-18 PET levels compared to those with normal Florbetapir F-18\nPET. Consistent with our results, relatively young patients with autosomal dominant AD showed an increase in WMH subsequent to amyloid deposition, 7 suggesting that amyloid pathology may entail white matter alterations. In humans, arterial spin labeling studies showed that lower tissue perfusion was associated not only with WMH volume but also DTI alterations in fiber tracts outside the WMH. 62 Together, these results suggest that A𝛽-related small vessel disease constitutes a potential pathomechanism underlying the microstructural fiber tract alterations observed in the current study.\nHypertension is an age-related cerebrovascular risk factor and may thus enhance the risk of white matter alterations. In addition, cerebrovascular disease has been suggested to enhance the development of AD, 63 and thus hypertension may not only be a vascular risk factor but also a risk factor for enhanced accumulation of A𝛽 in the brain. 18 In our study, the effects of A𝛽 on both MD alterations and WMH were, however, independent of the hypertension status, suggesting that hypertensive small vessel disease does not account for the observed effects on white matter. It is still possible that hypertension enhances the development of A𝛽 18 and exacerbates A𝛽-related small vessel disease, 64 but in the current study, hypertension was not the major determinant. We caution, however, that in the majority of cases hypertension was treated, and thus any effects of hypertension may have been attenuated by treatment. Multiple sources may synergisti-cally contribute to white matter alterations and cognitive decline, 656667 where future studies need to address the causative relationship and mechanistic pathways between these factors.\nFor the interpretation of the current study, some caveats should be considered. Although an increase in MD is commonly thought to reflect decreased fiber tract integrity, the exact sources of changes in DTI signal are not well understood. 68,69 Changes in MD may be influenced by changes in crossing fibers 10,68,69 or an increase in extracellular free water without pronounced alterations of fiber tract structure itself, 70 which complicates the attribution of MD differences to underlying changes in fiber tract integrity. Multishell acquisition protocols and free water elimination have been developed 717273 to alleviate such shortcomings; however, this work is ongoing. 74 Furthermore, we focused on MD only, and our results do not necessarily generalize to other DTI indices such as fractional anisotropy (FA), even though we found that MD and FA were highly correlated in our data set (data not shown). Another caveat is that the current study does not include longitudinal data, which would be instructive to establish the temporal sequence of age-related development of A𝛽 and white matter changes during the adult life span. 63,75 Reduced perfusion and impaired bloodbrain barrier function have been proposed to precede the development of A𝛽. 1,56,57 Furthermore, small vessel disease may interact with A𝛽 pathology, and thus exacerbate the development of AD pathology. 64,76 The current cross-sectional findings cannot disentangle the directionality of the effect that white matter alterations, possibly stemming from small vessel disease, and A𝛽 pathology may exert on each other.\nLastly, we note that while our results suggest A𝛽 to be associated with white matter alterations at higher age, one alternative possibility is that the association between A𝛽 and white matter alterations becomes better detectable at higher age, where white matter integrity is more variable. Biological factors that may enhance the association between A𝛽 and white matter alterations specifically at higher age remain still unclear. In conclusion, the current study shows that the occurrence of A𝛽 deposition is associated with an age-related increase in white matter alterations. Our results have clinical implications. Small vessel disease is treatable, and interventions enhancing vascular health at an early disease stage may thus alleviate disease progression in patients with increased levels of A𝛽. 77 Recently developed, clinically applicable neuroimaging markers of white matter damage 41 could help track white matter alterations and treatment effects, both in response to vascular or A𝛽-targeted intervention for secondary prevention.",

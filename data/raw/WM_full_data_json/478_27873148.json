    "abstract": "Purpose Descriptors extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be employed to locate and characterize a wide range of pathologies. Scalar measures are typically derived within a single-voxel unit, but neighborhood-based texture measures can also be applied. In this work, we propose a new set of descriptors to compute local texture characteristics from scalar measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), such as mean and radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy. Methods We employ weighted rotational invariant local operators, namely standard deviation, inter-quartile range, coefficient of variation, quartile coefficient of variation and skewness. Sensitivity and specificity of those texture descriptors were analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics of the white matter on a diffusion MRI group study of elderly healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild or moderate Alzheimers disease (AD). In addition, robustness against noise has been assessed with a realistic diffusion-weighted imaging phantom and the contamination of the local neighborhood with gray matter has been measured.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diffusion MRI is predominantly interpreted as a modality to estimate the spatial distribution of the diffusion of water molecules 2. One common diffusion MRI model is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which describes the tensor of the diffusion directions. DTI found numerous applications in the study of neurosurgery 19, psychiatric 18 and neurological disorders 32 and is most commonly applied on the white matter (WM) of the brain 12 where water tends to diffuse preferentially parallel to fiber tracts because the myelin sheath and cell membranes restrict the diffusion perpendicular to the direction of the axons. Given that the diffusion tensor is a mathematical entity whose comparison and interpretation are not straightforward, most DTI group studies rely on scalar measures which encode different rotationally invariant properties of the original diffusion tensor.\nThe most commonly employed measures are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) 29. Also useful for describing the diffusion are radial and axial diffusivity 6, linear measure, tensor mode 20, and others 3,8,22. The choice of suitable scalar measures is a critical step for DTI analyses, as their robustness to noise, or sensitivity and specificity to the pathological condition (i.e., ability to discriminate healthy from diseased patients, or between patients with different disease states) have a key role in the performance of the studies.\nMost of the literature related to the derivation of new DTI scalar measures has focused on the behavior of different anisotropy measures with respect to noise. It is worth noting that most of the recently proposed anisotropy indices have similar contrast-to-noise ratio than FA 7,15. Only few DTI methods, which incorporate a local neighborhood, have been described. The lattice index 26 measures the similarity of the predominant diffusion directions on a local weighted neighborhood in 2D. The inter-voxel local diffusion homogeneity 10 uses an unweighted 3D neighborhood. The local diffusion homogeneity might be sensitive to age-related changes in WM but less robust than MD or FA against motion artifacts in the MRI acquisition process 17. Neither of these methods is rotational invariant.\nThe aim of this work is to present new DTI descriptors to improve the identification of subtle differences of the integrity of the white matter architecture between healthy and diseased brains (dementia, multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, etc.). Our hypothesis is that well-defined texture operators, attached to existing scalar measures, can improve the identification of differences of the white matter architecture between patients with different levels of cognitive impairment. We propose a new set of image filtering methods directly on traditional scalar measures using rotationally invariant weighted local descriptors (average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, etc.) to improve the discriminative power and robustness against noise. These statistical descriptors are inter-voxel in nature and may extract additional texture information that was not revealed by the original scalar measures, allowing to localize formerly undetected areas and opening a door to new viewpoints for the analysis of neuronal pathologies.\nFor the evaluation of the texture operators, we directly analyze the performance with a real-world DTI group study, instead of indirectly assessing the sensitivity and specificity to disease by means of the ability to distinguish between different types of brain tissue. We choose an Alzheimers disease (AD) study with four distinct cohorts and restrict the final analysis to three input scalar measures MD, RD and FA, which were shown to differentiate well on AD 29. Tractbased spatial statistics (TBSS) are employed as they have Fig. 1 DTI scalar measures (MD, RD or FA) are filtered with weighted local texture operators (  ). Then, they are registered to atlas space and projected to the WM skeleton, allowing to derive statistical comparisons between patients become widely accepted for such analyses 30. In addition, we analyze the overlap of the neighborhood with gray matter and examine the performance of the local operators with respect to Rician noise.",

    "Local texture operators": {
      "text": "Linear and nonlinear local texture operators are computed. Both incorporate a Gaussian weighting mask N R and a binary volume of interest VOI. The weighting mask N R is rotationally invariant and monotonic decreasing from the center voxel and thus minimizes remote influences of potential gray matter voxels within the neighborhood. It reads:\nwhere -1 (0.99) is the evaluation of the probit function at p  0.99, r the 3D offset relative to voxel x,  the Euclidean norm and R the isotropic radius. To compute meaningful 3D information, the mask must contain at least three nontrivial voxels in each direction, but must be small enough not to contaminate the texture information with gray matter voxels. Formulas for the linear operators are based on weighted cumulants 27. First, the following parameters are defined:\nwhere VOI contains ones inside and zeros outside the brain, S is the input scalar measure,  is the point-wise multiplication,  is the convolution operator and i  1 is an integer number. Now, the weighted cumulants read\nThe nonlinear operators are computed from weighted quantiles. For each voxel x, let r 1 , . . . , r M be the labeling of all 3D offsets of N R which induces the ascending sorting of the values of S: i  1, . . . , M -1 : S(x  r i )  S(x  r i1 ). The weighted quantile at a given percentile Pr  0, 1 reads now:\nwith N  R the normalized weighting mask\nFrom the definitions above, six scalar measures are defined; the weighted average is only included for completeness, though not new in DTI imaging:\n-the weighted average\n-the weighted standard deviation\n-the weighted coefficient of variation\n-the weighted standardized skewness\n-the weighted inter-quartile range\n-and the weighted quartile coefficient of variation SD and CV. SD and IQR emphasize areas with a high local gradient similar to their scale invariant counterparts CV and QCV. The third moment SKW reveals different information than the other operators, which becomes visually apparent in the case of its application to MD and RD. However, in the case of FA, SKW equals to a certain extent CV and QCV. The weighted standardized kurtosis was derived in a similar manner to the other linear operators, but later excluded due to its weak sensitivity and specificity between the tested cohorts.",

    "Analysis of diagnostic performance": {
      "text": "No significant differences ( p  0.1) were found between HC versus MCI or between MCI versus Mild AD. Except for FA RAW and AVG, parameters between other cohorts increased with progressing dementia: HC  Mild AD  Mod AD and MCI  Mod AD. None of the parameters contained significantly increased and decreased areas at the same moment. The traditional measures (RAW or AVG) found significant differences only between healthy patients and those with AD, while the texture operators additionally located change at MCI  Mod AD and between the two AD cohorts (Mild AD  Mod AD), as shown in Fig. 3. Note that although MD and RD consistently increased with disease severity and FA decreased, less voxels with significant differences were found on the RAW and AVG operators in the comparison between HC versus Mod AD compared to HC versus Mild AD. This might have been caused by the limited statistical power of this comparison due to the small number of patients in Mod AD (N  7).\nThe application of the operators to MD and RD followed a widely similar pattern, both, in regard to the number and in regard to their spatial distribution. With regard to MD, SD, IQR, CV and QCV discriminated on four pairs, while the other operators only at two (SKW and AVG) or one pair of groups (RAW). MD SD and CV detected similar locations; however, MD CV revealed stronger indications of impairments between Mild AD and Mod AD on the sensory cortex 123 and parietal lobe, as shown in Fig. 4. The application of higher order moments (SD, CV, SKW) on FA did not improve the diagnostic performance of FA AVG.",

    "Analysis of robustness": {
      "text": "The most of the local operators had higher robustness against noise than the single-voxel RAW operator, as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe noise characteristics obtained on MD and RD were very similar. Applied to MD or RD, AVG increased the robustness against noise constantly by a factor of 1.8, while FA AVG increased the robustness depending on the SNR by up to factor of 4, compared to RAW. Also the local texture operators of MD and RD were more robust than RAW, with the exception of SD for high SNRs and SKW for low SNRs. The robustness against noise of MDRD CV, QCV and for high SNRs of SKW increased by a factor 1.8 to 2.2, exceeding also the robustness of MDRD AVG. If applied to FA, SD and CV were only robust for high SNRs (2.2 and, respectively, 1.6 times of RAW), while IQR, QCV and SKW were rather sensitive to noise.\nThe comparison of N 4mm with unweighted 333 neighborhoods N 27 , N 19 and N 7 is shown in Fig. 6. Although the spatial dimension of N 4mm exceeded the one of the unweighted neighborhoods, its contamination with gray matter was still low: approximately 92 of all neighborhoods were at least to 90 in WM. Furthermore, N 4mm contained more neighborhoods with a minimum white matter share of 93 (N 27 ), 80 (N 19 ) and 65 (N 7 ), respectively.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The experimental work performed here focused on the analysis of two important aspects: the ability to discrimi-nate between pathological conditions in a group study and the evolution with varying SNR. With regard to the first one, results showed that some of the proposed local texture operators highly increased the ability to differentiate between groups. Concerning the second one, most parameters obtained high robustness against noise, some texture operators even exceeded the robustness of AVG.\nA DTI data set with multiple stages of Alzheimers disease was selected as an experimental benchmark because it allowed to quantify the potential gain of the new operators. Indeed, new differences between groups arose when employing the proposed approach, which is a strong advantage over traditional measures. In particular, the texture parameters SD, CV, IQR and QCV, if applied on MD or RD, exceeded the performance of RAW and even AVG. For instance, CV and QCV obtained generally higher robustness to noise and higher discriminative potential than AVG. When considering noise and discriminative analysis together, local texture parameters of MD and RD were more adequate for the conducted AD group studies than those based on FA. AVG was the only neighborhood-based standard DTI operator among the proposed ones, since weighted averaging is commonly employed in voxel-based morphometry 1 and TBSS 30; it obtained high robustness to noise, but was, unlike other texture parameters, unable to reveal differences between MCI versus Mod AD or Mild AD versus Mod AD.\nIn general, also alternative statistical analyses could be performed, such as the general voxel-based (VBA) or atlasbased analysis (ABA), which do not require skeletonization of the WM 23. However, TBSS analysis was used in this work because of two reasons. First, as TBSS is a widely employed DTI analysis tool 38, it facilitates the interpretation and comparison of the results among other approaches. Second, since TBSS centers the neighborhoods on the WM skeleton, it minimizes any contamination with gray matter.\nStill, the mask size must be selected carefully according to the spatial resolution. If the mask exceeds noticeably the distance from the WM skeleton to gray matter voxels, local features become mainly dependent on changes in local morphometry, which decreases the discriminative power particularly at the boundaries of the WM. In terms of contamination with gray matter, N 4mm contained similar characteristics than the unweighted reference masks, while being advantageous in terms of sample size and isotropy: in contrast to N 4mm , the reference masks N 27 , N 19 and N 7 are anisotropic (3  3  9 mm 3 ) and thus favor longitudinal fiber tracts over transversal or sagittal ones.\nThe interpretation of the results may be difficult compared to traditional measures, which is a common issue of texture operators 10. Differences in traditional scalar measures, such as FA, have been often related to physiological changes in the WM tissue (demyelination, lower packing density or different membrane permeability, among others) 16. However, changes in FA, MD or RD can be caused by very different mechanisms within the tissue, which makes bold interpretations of changes in the WM integrity, although very common, possibly flawed 14. The use of the proposed local operators, on the other hand, can open a door to new viewpoints for the analysis of pathologies. For instance, MD CV discovered a progressing impairment from mild to moderate AD of brain areas, which are commonly related to sensations (sensory cortex), perception, spelling and arithmetic (parietal lobe). These impairments remained hidden on standard parameters (RAW and AVG).\nHead motion during diffusion MRI acquisition is a known source of image artifacts. As indicated in Analysis of diagnostic performance section, the DWIs were linearly registered to the baseline volume before tensor estimation, and image quality was individually checked on the tensor volumes using color by orientation maps. However, undesired attenuation in single DWI slices due to motion during the diffusion-encoding gradient pulse cannot be completely excluded. In principle, these motion effects could lead to artifacts in the scalar measures obtained from the diffusion tensor, such as an underestimation of anisotropy indices. Even though previous studies in the literature have reported possible false positive findings in group studies due to this effect and have even described how these artifacts can be more prominent in some neural pathways 39, there is no indication that the proposed measures could be more affected by motion artifacts than the original RAW measures. As these motion artifacts can be expected to behave in a somehow smooth manner across the brain, it is even possible that the measures based on local variability are more robust to motion artifacts than the original measures, but a detailed analysis of this effect would be needed to elucidate this.\nThe application of the proposed texture operators is not limited to DTI, but could be applied to any scalar measure. In particular, the application on Q-Ball scalar measures from high angular resolution diffusion imaging might be investigated, for instance the generalized anisotropy 25, generalized fractional anisotropy 35 or fractional multi-fiber index 9. Studies with higher spatial resolution than the one employed here could achieve improvements regarding the robustness and localization of the changed areas.

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "In this work, we presented new image processing methods for the identification and characterization of in the white matter of the brain based on DTI. Instead of deriving new scalar measures directly from DWI, we further processed existing DTI scalar measures such as FA, MD and RD with rotational invariant texture operators. Each combination of existing scalar measures and texture operators provided a novel measure with new and distinct properties, which was in many cases more suitable than the original single-voxel measure for particular discrimination problems of DTI studies. Compound sensitivity and specificity of the operators were compared with the one of the traditional measures on a group study of Alzheimers disease. Additionally, noise characteristics were measured with a synthetic DWI phantom and the overlap of the local operators with gray matter was analyzed.\nTexture parameters based on MD and RD yielded the highest discriminative power and robustness against noise and were able to identify formerly undetected changes even between previously insignificant pairs of groups Mild AD versus Mod AD. Thus, the results indicate that the methods are a promising extension in DTI studies. Future work might investigate the application of the proposed methods on group studies of different alterations of the brain (multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, etc.) to improve the detection and localization of the changes between groups.",

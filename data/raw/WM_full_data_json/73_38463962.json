    "abstract": "Age-related white matter (WM) microstructure maturation and decline occur throughout the human lifespan, complementing the process of gray matter development and degeneration. Here, we create normative lifespan reference curves for global and regional WM microstructure by harmonizing diffusion MRI (dMRI)-derived data from ten public datasets (N  40,898 subjects; age: 3-95 years; 47.6 male). We tested three harmonization methods on regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fractional anisotropy (FA), a metric of WM microstructure, extracted using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. ComBat-GAM harmonization provided multi-study trajectories most consistent with known WM maturation peaks. Lifespan FA reference curves were validated with test-retest data and used to assess the effect of the ApoE4 risk factor for dementia in WM across the lifespan. We found significant associations between ApoE4 and FA in WM regions associated with neurodegenerative disease even in healthy individuals across the lifespan, with regional age-by-genotype interactions. Our lifespan reference curves and tools to harmonize new dMRI data to the curves are publicly available as eHarmonize (https:github.comahzhueharmonize).",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Methodological variability and small sample sizes have contributed to poor reproducibility in population studies across many research fields, including neuroscience and brain imaging 1,2 . As brain MRI scanning is costly and time-intensive, large well-powered neuroimaging studies typically require pooling of data from smaller, existing studies or data collection across multiple sites. In either case, two primary sources of variance make it non-trivial to combine multi-site neuroimaging data. First, heterogeneous study design and subject inclusion criteria may yield results that are generalizable only to similar cohorts. Second, MRI scans and derived metrics vary considerably due to differences in scanner hardware and software, acquisition parameters such as spatial or angular resolution, and image processing pipelines 3 . Even when acquisition protocols are harmonized, inter-site differences still persist 4 .\nMulti-study consortia, such as the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium 5 , may account for study differences using a traditional two-stage (i.e., group-based) meta-analysis. Meta-analyses allow individual studies to account for study-specific covariates and population substructure, but if specific traits or conditions of interest have a low prevalence, e.g., rare copy number variants in the genome, meta-analysis may not be possible as single sites may lack sufficient samples to run statistical models. When small studies are conducted, model assumptions of normally distributed sampling and known variances may be violated 6 , and inflated effect sizes from smaller studies may contribute to the meta-analytic results 1 . Meta-analyses may also be unable to distinguish between site differences and confounding biological variables that are correlated with site 7 . Beyond this, in a lifespan study, age-dependent effects (e.g., specifically occurring in development or senescence) may be diluted using a meta-analysis approach.\nBrain imaging studies that analyze data from individuals across the lifespan may benefit instead from a mega-analysis approach, which pools data or derived imaging features for a single analysis based on all individual data points. Mega-analysis can accommodate a broader range of statistical models and better control of effect size estimation 8 . Growth charts have been established for anthropometric measurements, such as height and weight, but until recently, study differences and the lack of standardization have hindered pooling datasets of sufficiently large sample sizes and age ranges to establish normative models for brain MRI measures. The emergence of large public datasets and data harmonization techniques have made lifespan brain charts possible to create. Initial brain charts using structural MRI measures across the lifespan have combined multi-study data for mega-analyses with different approaches to account for site heterogeneity, including generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAM-LSS) to account for non-linear trajectories of global and regional volume, surface area, and thickness measurements 9 , linear and non-linear hierarchical Bayes models of subcortical volume and cortical thickness 10,11 , and fractional polynomial regression applied to harmonized cortical thickness measures 12 . Ge et al. compared methods for normative modeling of brain morphometry and chose multivariate fractional polynomial regression models to create sex-specific lifespan charts for subcortical volumes and cortical surface area and thickness measures, available through CentileBrain (www.centilebrain.org) 13 .\nComBat is a commonly used harmonization method, initially developed to correct for batch effects in gene expression arrays 14 , but later applied to derived neuroimaging measures 15,16 . ComBat expanded upon previous models, implementing an empirical Bayes framework that is robust to small sample sizes. Recent extensions of ComBat include ComBat-GAM 17 and CovBat 18 , which account for non-linear effects of covariates on the brain measures, and adjust for site differences in data covariance, respectively. Structural imaging studies have shown that ComBat and ComBat-GAM may improve the detection of case-control group differences in schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cohorts compared to unharmonized mixed-effects models that model study as a random effect 19,20 .\nThe initial application of ComBat in the neuroimaging literature was to data derived from diffusion-weighted MRI 16 . Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to white matter (WM) microstructure and is influenced by a greater number of acquisition parameters than T1-weighted MRI, including spatial and angular resolution, diffusion times, b-value, and the number of shells 21 . In general, greater angular resolution and number of b-shells (e.g., diffusion weightings) give more stable diffusion metrics 22,23 , and smaller voxel sizes are less susceptible to partial voluming but may have more noise 22,24 . The initial application of ComBat to dMRI-derived data was limited to pooling together only two studies that had similar age ranges and acquisition parameters 16 . While it has since been used more widely in studies of epilepsy 25 , traumatic brain injury 26 , and neurogenetic disorders 27 , harmonization of dMRI metrics across age ranges and acquisition protocols has not been explored in depth. Single-site dMRI studies have found lifespan trajectories of WM microstructure to be different to those of T1w-derived gray matter measures: peak WM maturation typically occurs over a decade later than corresponding peaks for gray matter metrics 28,29 , necessitating the development of dMRI-specific lifespan curves. Most prior dMRI studies have used measures extracted from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model. The DTI model has been widely adopted in clinical studies to understand WM microstructure because, compared to more advanced models, it can be reliably fit to lower resolution data which is more convenient and faster to collect. This widespread use is particularly advantageous when combining studies with different dMRI acquisitions.\nAlthough harmonization approaches such as ComBat are widely used, limitations remain. ComBat regularizes site-specific harmonization parameters differently depending on sample size, and is sensitive to the input data, such that if a new cohort were to join the study, the harmonization would need to be repeated. To avoid incorrectly modeling true biological variability as a scanner-related effect, datasets must have a sufficient overlap in all covariates, e.g., age ranges. Multi-site mega-analyses often need a centralized database, which may limit participation by sites that cannot share individual level data. Harmonizing data to a template or reference that can be distributed would overcome this limitation. ComBat and its variants typically adjust input data so that the residuals of a statistical model have the same mean and variance, but none provide a reference dataset to perform normalization consistently across studies. However, care is required when choosing the reference dataset, as harmonized results may be biased toward the selected data. An ideal reference for harmonization would include multiple populations across a wide age range, such as the NiChart Reference Dataset aggregating structural MRI data for the iSTAGING consortium 17 , and provide a means to account for differences in MRI acquisition protocols. A normative model could be created, incorporating heterogeneous datasets to represent the different sources of variance, and used as a reference for ComBat harmonization. Here, we created a framework that harmonizes input data to built-in lifespan reference curves, allowing for distributed harmonization, easy incorporation of new datasets, and version control of updatable lifespan reference curves.\nHere, we harmonized DTI data from ten public datasets, totaling 13,297 subjects (aged 3-95), to create lifespan reference curves for white matter regions extracted with the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline 30,31 . The ENIGMA-DTI pipeline is a well-established pipeline based on tract-based spatial statistics 32 with standardized outputs, which has been run on data from over a hundred cohorts worldwide, in studies of over ten disorders 33 . We evaluated lifespan curves computed using ComBat, ComBat-GAM, and CovBat to determine which methods would most effectively capture the expected non-linear trends 28,34,2928,34 . After creating an optimal set of lifespan reference curves, we harmonized an independent group of test datasets (2,161 subjects, aged 3-85), acquired with dMRI protocols previously unseen in our training data, to our newly established lifespan reference curves. We characterized the impact of acquisition parameters on harmonization parameters, the regional sex differences in our lifespan reference curves, and the performance of our framework on longitudinal data. Lastly, as the effect of genetic risk factors may vary across the lifespan, we evaluated our framework by assessing the effects of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype on white matter microstructure in a multi-study sample aged 3-85 (N  30,915). The E4 allele is the major risk haplotype for late-onset Alzheimers disease -compared to the most common genotype, E3 -whereas E2 is less common and may have a neuroprotective effect 35 . The overall framework -including the harmonization mechanism and our lifespan reference curves are freely available in an open source Python package called ENIGMA Harmonize (eHarmonize; https:github.comahzhueharmonize).",

      "text": "Data for Building Reference Curves. Public dMRI datasets collected from individuals across a variety of age ranges were combined to span 3 to 95 years of age (N  40,898 subjects; 47.6 male; Table 1). The pediatric and adolescent cohorts (age: 3-21) included the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) dataset 36 ; Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D) 37 ; and the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) 38 studies. As the ABCD study contains twin and sibling data, one sibling per family was randomly selected to create an unrelated subset. Participants in the ABCD study were recruited from a very narrow age range (9-10 years old), yet at the time of analysis, two-year follow up scans had also been released for most participants. We broadened the age range by including data from half the participants at baseline and an independent half at two year follow-up. No additional exclusion criteria were applied to the PING and HCP-D datasets for this work.\nThe young adult cohorts (age: 17-36) included baseline data from the Southwest University Longitudinal Imaging Multimodal (SLIM) brain data repository 39,40 and Human Connectome Project (HCP) 41 . Each study acquired MRI data on a single scanner. As with ABCD, HCP is family-based, so only one sibling per family was selected. The Cam-CAN dataset included younger, midlife, and older adults (18 to 87 years) 42 . Mid-adulthood to older adults (age: 30-95) were included from Tier 1 of the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) 43 , Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS3) dataset 44 , the population-based UK Biobank study 45 , and a subset of the third phase of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with single-shell diffusion imaging acquisition (ADNI3) 46 . In the PPMI, OASIS3, and ADNI3 studies, participants with a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia were excluded from the reference training cohort. Exclusion criteria applied to the UK Biobank included neurological and cerebrovascular disorders as well as incidental findings on brain MRI and head injuries. Evaluation Datasets. Seven datasets were held out to evaluate the reference curves made from the other datasets, as detailed in the Reference Curve Evaluation section (Table 1).\nChildren scanned as part of the NIH Pediatric MRI study with the extended diffusion MRI protocol were included as the pediatric test cohort 47 . Children younger than 3 years of age were excluded. Brain MRIs from the Teen Alcohol Outcomes Study (TAOS) and the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function (GOBS) study were acquired on the same scanner with the same acquisition protocol 48 . As a result, they were combined to provide a lifespan dataset including both children and adults. One child per family was selected for the TAOS dataset. As the GOBS study is composed of extensive pedigrees, selecting one member per family would have decreased the sample size considerably. Instead, a kinship filter was implemented, where only individuals with less than a first-degree cousin relationship were included (kinship  0.125). Older adults from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) study were also included 49,50 .\nTo further evaluate our template in handling test data with differences in scan parameters, we included two datasets with which we calculated DTI metrics for the same individuals in different ways. The first dataset, the Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM) study 51 , included individuals scanned with two protocols of differing angular and spatial resolution 52 . The second dataset we used was the subset of multi-shell diffusion MRI data from ADNI3, for which we calculated DTI metrics with both b-shells.",

In the training datasets with a multi-shell acquisition, the most appropriate shell for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was chosen for processing, usually b  1000 smm 2 53,54 . As with many large-scale multi-study initiatives in ENIGMA, preprocessing steps varied across studies as datasets were collected and processed over the past 15 years. Preprocessing followed guidelines provided by the ENIGMA-DTI team (on GitHub), which includes steps such as EPI distortion and eddy current distortion correction. FSLs dtifit was used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity maps. As ADNI3-S127 dMRI acquisitions were multi-shell, dtifit was run on volumes from the b1000 and b2000 smm 2 shells independently, for comparison.\nImages were then processed through the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline 31 . The FA maps were warped to the ENIGMA template and then skeletonized using tract-based spatial statistics 32 . The mean FA value was extracted from the full skeleton as well as each region of interest (ROI) defined by the JHU atlas 30 . Bilateral ROIs were combined by averaging the measures across hemispheres, and some subregion ROIs were combined to create a single measure for the entire structure, e.g., the three parts of the corpus callosum. In both cases, the combined average was weighted by the number of voxels in each ROI. A lifespan reference curve was created for all measures, lateralized and combined. In subsequent analyses, we report only the results for the combined measures (25 ROIs; Table 2).",

CovBat was run using the R package of the same name (https:github.comandy1764CovBat_Harmonization). Across all methods, age and sex were used as covariates, with the dataset modeled as the batch effect. As the outputs of the ComBat family harmonization methods are weighted by the sample size of each study, harmonization was run using iterative subsampling of all datasets to provide more equal weighting across datasets (25 iterations; 200 subjects per dataset where available; 13,297 subjects in total) as the UK Biobank greatly outnumbered the other datasets. The larger datasets (UK Biobank and ABCD) were sampled without replacement, while the smaller datasets were sampled with replacement.\nComBat 14 : ComBat is a location and scale adjustment model where, for site i and individual j, it assumes that the feature measurements are modeled as a linear combination of site effects and non-site effects, written as:\nwhere is the overall mean per feature , is the vector of corresponding coefficients to the covariate α",

      "text": "After the training datasets were subsampled and harmonized using the three ComBat methods, the outputs of each method were combined for evaluation. To create reference curves, GAM models were fit for each ROI and harmonization method, covarying for sex and smoothing across age using the mgcv package in R(basis function: 10 cubic splines). To evaluate the harmonization methods, we extracted the peak age, i.e., the age of maximum FA, from each region that exhibited a concave down trajectory. We compared our harmonized curves to previous single-site studies of the white matter microstructure that reported FA to peak between the ages of 20 and 40 years old 28,29 . We used these as our silver standard, i.e., a standard established by in vivo models rather than histological studies.\nOnce the optimal harmonization method was selected, GAM models were fit to each ROI, covarying for sex and smoothing across age. We used the qgam package in R (basis function: 10 cubic splines) to fit quantile regression GAM models for each centile (0.1-0.99) to generate normative lifespan reference curves for each sex.\nThe ComBat-GAM Python package (neuroHarmonize) does not allow the user to specify a reference site, so we adapted the code to allow for that functionality (available through neuroHarmonize fork: https:github.comahzhuneuroharmonize). Evaluation datasets were harmonized to the lifespan reference curves, i.e., the location and scale parameters ( and respectively) of each site was calculated in relation γ",

    "Train vs. Test Datasets.": {
      "text": "Using the adapted ComBat-GAM code, all available data from the training datasetsas well as the seven held-out datasets -were harmonized to the newly created lifespan reference curves. Using each subjects age and sex, the differences between reference-predicted and site-harmonized values were calculated, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated for each protocol and ROI. For each ROI, an unpaired t-test was used to compare the performance of our harmonization framework on training vs test datasets (FDR-corrected; 25 tests).\nAcquisition Effects on Model Parameters. Spatial resolution, number of diffusion directions, and choice of b-value are all known to affect DTI values. We tested for correlations between voxel volume and the ComBat output scale and shift parameters from both training and test datasets. We also analyzed the angular resolution and number of volumes (b0 and b-shells combined); other acquisition parameters such as b-value and scanner manufacturer, were highly homogeneous across studies, and we were not able to determine their effects on model parameters.\nLongitudinal Studies. To determine how our framework would perform for longitudinal studies, we harmonized longitudinal data in two ways: first, we calculated the scale and shift parameters from the baseline data and applied them to the follow-up data; second, we calculated the scale and shift parameters from the baseline and follow-up data separately. We then ran mixed-effects models to determine how the different methods impacted the modeled age effects on each ROI, covarying for sex, age-by-sex interaction, and age 2 and including subject ID as a random effect. The mixed-effects models were also run in the unharmonized data, which was used for comparison. We used data from the UK Biobank, which has a subset of subjects with follow-up imaging visits acquired approximately two years after baseline (N  1,384, baseline ages 47-80 years, mean time interval: 2.25 years).\nCase Studies. To examine the outcome of case-control analyses after harmonization, we chose to analyze the effects of ApoE across the lifespan as the data was available in most datasets and requires no harmonization of its own. Genetic data was collected in seven of the ten training datasets, and two of the evaluation datasets (Table 3). From datasets that released full genetic data, the ApoE SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 were extracted for analysis. Other datasets focusing on aging populations had only made ApoE genotypes available, and the provided data was used for this study. As genome-wide data was not available for all studies, subjects were filtered for European ancestry using self-provided race or ethnicity information. Only healthy controls as defined in Table 1 were included. Analyses were run separately for E2 and E4 allele counts, each using E3E3 homozygotes as controls and excluding carriers of the other allele. Linear regressions tested for effects of E2 or E4 count on harmonized regional FA, adjusting for age, sex, age-by-sex, and age 2 , and multiple comparisons corrected using FDR (25 tests). In secondary analyses, ApoE-by-age interactions were tested in nominally significant ROIs.\nTwo test sets ADNI3-S127 and QTIM had data available from different dMRI protocols on the same subjects, as described above. For both datasets, we ran the ApoE regressions pre-and post-harmonization with both sets of FA metrics. We then compared the effect sizes to determine how much of an impact the differences in protocol made on the statistical outputs, and if they were different, to determine if harmonization would result in a convergence of the results. In the QTIM study, we ran the ApoE4 analyses in both the low spatial and angular resolution scans and the high spatial and angular resolution scans. In the ADNI3-S127 dataset, we ran the same models in the different diffusion shells: b1000 vs b2000 smm 2 . eHarmonize Combining our modified ComBat-GAM code with the lifespan reference curves, we created the eHarmonize Python package (https:github.comahzhueharmonize), which comes equipped with command line tools to read in FA measures and harmonize them to the included centile reference curves while taking age and sex into account (Figure 6). The eHarmonize command line interface was written to harmonize data from a new site to the built-in lifespan reference curves and apply an existing harmonization model to new data from a known site. To account for dMRI acquisitions that do not cover a full field-of-view, eHarmonize detects which subset of ROIs are provided before calculating harmonization model parameters as the underlying neuroHarmonize does not handle missing data.",

Qualitatively, study FA trajectories across age were better aligned after harmonization, regardless of method. The performance of ComBat and CovBat appeared similar. The peak ages for white matter FA in these references were mostly before twenty years of age (Table 2). In the pediatric datasets, the steep increase in FA with age was maintained, but due to the larger age range and number of adult datasets, the linear model resulted in larger harmonized FA values than the outputs from the GAM model. The peak age of white matter FA in almost all of the ComBat-GAM references was between 20 and 40 years old, matching the expected values 2829 . As a result, we used the ComBat-GAM harmonized data to create the lifespan reference curves. Table 2. The age at which regional white matter skeleton FA trajectories peaked fell mostly below 20 years of age in the ComBat and CovBat reference curves.

With the exception of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), the age peaks of all lifespan reference curves fell between 20 and 40 years of age.

Across most regions, our reference curves show a steep increase in FA during development, peaking between the ages of 20 and 40, followed by a continuous and gradual decrease for the rest of the lifespan. One notable exception was the splenium of the corpus callosum. While the FA also increases steeply during development, it plateaus in the early 20s and then peaks later at 68 years. Previous studies have found the FA of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) to be relatively stable with age in adulthood 58 , possibly due to posterior-to-anterior development and anterior-to-posterior aging trends 59,60 . The widely diverging projections of the splenium may account for the late peak as the loss of diverging fibers increases FA followed by an overall decline 61 . Another outlier region is the fornix, which has the same overall trends, but a much sharper decline. Given its location, this likely reflects greater misregistration and partial voluming associated with age-related atrophy and nearby ventricular expansion 62 .\nWe found sex differences across the WM skeleton across the lifespan. Most regions showed higher FA in males than in females, and the opposite effect was found in six ROIs. Prior studies of sex differences in white matter microstructure have also reported regional variation 50,63,64 . These sex effects may be affected by covariates, such as intracranial volume (ICV). In a study using the HUNT dataset, analyses without an ICV covariate found regionally varying sex effects, but after including ICV, only females had regions with significantly higher FA 50 . We did not incorporate ICV as a covariate in our harmonization framework as it is not an output of the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline and is generally estimated from T1-weighted MRI, as opposed to dMRI.\nFor longitudinal studies, we showed that harmonization parameters modeled on baseline data can be applied to follow-up data or parameters can be modeled independently in each timepoint. Results from our comparisons to unharmonized data were largely consistent between the two methods. In the UK Biobank, which we used for the analyses, the time interval between visits was much smaller than the age range of the study population. In some studies, the follow-up age range may fall outside the modeled age range at baseline, and a separate follow-up model may be advisable. This may be particularly advantageous for data in the non-linear ranges of the lifespan reference curves.\nOne major benefit of a lifespan dMRI reference is that it can be used to study subtle effects, such as genetic influences, on brain WM microstructure throughout life. Here, we harmonized FA data from the healthy controls of ten datasets to our lifespan reference curves and found an effect of lower global FA in subjects with the ApoE4 genotype compared to E3E3 homozygotes. The same effect was found regionally in the hippocampal cingulum, the posterior thalamic radiation, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. As a genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), our findings overlap with regions previously implicated in DTI studies of dementia 65,66 . Previous studies of white matter microstructure in cognitively healthy controls have also found E4 carriers to have lower FA than non-carriers, though published results are inconsistent and some studies have also reported null findings 67 . Most previous studies were either limited by smaller sample sizes (N  200) or a limited age range with most focusing on individuals aged 60 years and above, and fewer than five studies incorporating younger individuals. Our study was conducted in over 30,000 subjects and across the lifespan.\nWe also found a significant age-by-E4 interaction in the fornix (crus)stria terminalis whereby the FA of the E4 carriers was higher than that of E3 homozygotes early in life until approximately age 55 years, after which E4 carriers showed lower FA than noncarriers. The fornix and the stria terminalis are major output tracts of the hippocampus and amygdala, respectively. In a longitudinal lifespan study of structural imaging measures, age-dependent associations were found between E4 and rates of volume change in the hippocampus and the amygdala 7 . In both structures, E4 was associated with prolonged growth into adulthood and faster atrophy later in life. This age-by-E4 interaction may reflect the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis that the ApoE4 genotype may be advantageous earlier in life 68 .\nAs part of our ApoE analyses, we further evaluated datasets that had subjects acquired with multiple dMRI protocols. Diffusion-weighted MRI, and FA in particular, is affected by many acquisition parameters 21 . We found that the use of our lifespan harmonization framework does not converge the statistical results of the same population acquired on different protocols. However, we note that differences in FA due to acquisition protocols may reflect different underlying anatomy or biological processes. We found that voxel size was negatively correlated with the harmonization shift parameter, i.e., sites with larger voxels generally have lower FA values. Larger voxels are more likely to contain crossing fibers, which would result in lower FA values. In such a case, convergence of FA values between protocols at the expense of biological interpretability may not be desired.\nWe combined our lifespan reference curves and harmonization mechanism into a Python package called eHarmonize. Dissemination of the package will allow collaborators to harmonize their data on-site and then share either the harmonized measures, or -in situations where raw data cannot be shared (e.g., genetics studies) -results of an agreed upon analysis. In addition, new sites will be free to join existing projects without requiring re-harmonization of the previously collected and harmonized data. We also created the package framework to be flexible and adaptable to update our existing reference curves and include reference curves for other measures, such as diffusivity measures or even those extracted from another modality. Version control ensures appropriate provenance for reproducibility.\nThe datasets we used to build our lifespan reference curves are public and therefore available to researchers for many applications. As such, researchers harmonizing multi-site data for machine learning studies may be concerned about data leakage with these datasets in the harmonization reference. After applying the eHarmonize framework to training and testing datasets, we found that there was no significant difference in MAE between training and testing datasets (p  0.09). Our iterative sampling approach likely limited the overfitting of large datasets, such as the UK Biobank, so harmonization is not driven by any single dataset. eHarmonize may be an important tool for large scale machine learning purposes, but we recommend interested researchers to formally evaluate this for data leakage when using one of the training datasets, as was done in the establishment of harmonizer 69 .\nOur lifespan reference curves have a few limitations that we plan to address in future versions. First, we had uneven sampling across the age range. In particular, children younger than 8 years old and adults in the range of 35 to 45 years old were underrepresented. We also acknowledge that the protocols of our training data were largely homogeneous, good quality data, and our test sets were similar. For the next iteration of lifespan curves, we aim to include more data from our underrepresented age ranges and acquisition protocols. To address the connection between acquisition protocol and biological interpretation between studies, we will also evaluate the added value of separate lifespan reference curves for different acquisition parameters.\nTo expand on eHarmonizes functionality, future steps will include modeling functions that can take into account population-based sources of variability or additional model parameters. For the current study, we took care to only include unrelated and cross-sectional subsets of all studies. In the future, it would be important to examine nested random effects that account for a covariance (kinship) structure of the study population. There is currently one nested-ComBat package that implements both nested and Gaussian mixture model versions of ComBat 70 ; however, the functions are currently hard-coded for bi-modal or binary data. With regard to model parameters, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends GAM-LSS for creating lifespan charts 71 . GAM-LSS models may fit the first four moments of a distribution, adding in skew and kurtosis parameters, which GAM does not. Fitting more parameters robustly requires more data, and as many studies have small sample sizes, we elected to start with GAM models. For future studies wishing to combine only larger datasets, we will examine the effect of incorporating the ability to fit a GAM-LSS model. Additional features we will test include combining ComBat-GAM with CovBat to account for covariance between measures as well as the non-linear age trend.\nOverall, we successfully created lifespan reference curves for regional FA measures and made progress in applying ComBat-GAM to these references. Our framework provides studies with the ability to standardize their dMRI measures. Collaborators from different sites can also harmonize their data to our lifespan reference curves without worrying about their covariate overlap or differences in sample size. The framework is now available as a Python package at https:github.comahzhueharmonize.",

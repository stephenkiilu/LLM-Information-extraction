    "abstract": "Objectives: Alzheimers disease (AD) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are both associated with cognitive decline and ventriculomegaly. While promising approach in differentiating between the two diseases, only a few diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies compared directly NPH and AD patients. The current study compares global whitematter (WM) alterations in AD and NPH addressing some of the methodological issues of previous studies. Patients and methods: Diffusion tensor images were obtained from 17 patients with NPH, 14 with AD, and 17 healthy controls. White matter integrity was quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial ( 1) and radial diffusivity (RD). The diffusion parameters were compared between the groups in skeletonised tracts representing the core of the fibre bundles. Results: Reduced FA was found in NPH patients throughout the corpus callosum, particularly in the splenium, along with increased RD. On the other hand, FA, MD and RD were higher in NPH in the cortico-fugal fibres arising from the frontal and parietal cortex. While no FA changes were detected in AD patients compared to controls, widespread increased RD was observed. When comparing NPH and AD patients, higher FA, MD and RD was observed in the corona radiata in the periventricular fibres arising from the frontal and parietal cortex in NPH patients. The ventricular volumes were correlated with diffusivity parameters in the tracts next to the ventricles in AD and NPH patients. Conclusion: Our analysis identified a pattern of WM diffusion alterations that can differentiate NPH patients from controls and AD patients.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical syndrome, first described by Adams et al. 1, manifested by the clinical triad are some longitudinal studies suggesting that the co-occurring moderate-to-severe AD-related pathology results in poor response to VP shunting 6. However, the issue of misdiagnosis cannot be excluded in some cases and it can be one of the possible explanations for poor response to shunting; hence some patients may present with AD ventriculomegaly ex-vacuo rather than due to NPH 7. NPH with cognitive impairment as a prominent and initial symptom is considered to have worse prognosis after shunting. On the other hand, there was improvement in gait and cognition after shunting seen in patients that priory demonstrated typical NPH syndrome regardless of the co-occurrence of AD pathology 8,11.\nNPH-associated dementia is considered to be multifactorial, related to both cortical and subcortical changes, pressure-induced ischaemia or even vascular disease 8,12. The classic symptomatic triad occurring in NPH (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and cognitive decline) is predominantly thought to be related to the compression of the subcortical white matter (WM) tracts around the enlarged lateral ventricles. Consistent with neuropathological studies 13,14, WM alterations occur mainly as a result of dilated temporal horns of the lateral ventricles 15. Whereas ventriculomegaly is a key diagnostic hallmark in radiological evaluation of NPH, the magnitude of ventricular enlargement and the extent of WM impairment often do not go along with the severity of NPH symptoms or response to shunting 16.\nIn the last decade, a number of studies supported a growing role for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tensor-derived parameters in examining microstructural WM integrity, particularly for differential diagnosis between dementias 17. DTI provides quantitative information about the direction and the magnitude of water diffusion within tissue. While numerous DTI studies reported widespread diminished WM integrity particularly in the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes in AD 18,19, several DTI studies detected regional microstructural WM alterations in NPH compared with controls 202122. The first report on the use of DTI for hydrocephalus was acute dementia 23. In recent years neuroimaging gained substantial role in differential diagnosis, though so far only a few studies have compared diffusion differences between AD and NPH 15,17,21,24,25.\nDespite the merits of these studies, methodological issues compromise the generalizability of the results. Former investigations restricted the analysis to certain brain regions 15,17,24,25, an approach that is reasonable, but highly hypothesis driven and the cross-study comparisons are difficult. Other studies extended the analysis to the whole brain by using voxel-based morphometric analysis 21. However, the analysis was compromised by the possible misalignment of FA Images 26. To overcome this registration issue, the authors recommended that analysis should be restricted to the core of the fibre bundles, represented by the local maxima of FA 26.\nSeveral studies have used Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis in NPH patients 20,22,27, however NPH-related WM alterations were compared only to healthy controls and no comparisons to other dementia types were carried out. Our study compares whole brain WM integrity in AD and NPH. We hypothesised that the two diseases have different spatial pattern of various white matter diffusion parameters that can differentiate them. The control subjects were recruited among the healthy volunteers (from family members of patients and from the group who responded to the advertisement), with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorder.",

Additional disorders occurred in patients groups: hypertonia, hyperlipidaemia, hypothyreosis, benign prostate hypertrophy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, cardiomyopathy, hyperuricaemia and diabetes mellitus.\nAll AD patients were recruited by a neurologist from Memory Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology (University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic). The clinical diagnosis was made according to NINCDS-ADRDA and respecting new EFNS guidelines 28. The study protocol was approved by local institutional ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all subjects (or their guardians).\nMR imaging was carried out on a 3T GE Signa HDx MR imaging system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) in the Central Military Hospital, Prague. All sequences were acquired using 8-channel head coil. The MRI protocol included T1W and high-resolution 3D BRAVO sequence (TR: 10.9, TE: 4.6 ms, matrix: 352  224, FOV: 24  24 cm, flip angle: 13  , in-plane resolution: 0.68  1.07 mm 2 , slice thickness: 1 mm).

      "text": "Raw diffusion data were visually inspected and data with major movement artefact were excluded from further analysis. Then DTI images were corrected for eddy currents and motion artefacts by 12 degree of freedom (12DOF) affine linear registration to the first nondiffusion-weighted reference Image 29. Diffusion tensors at each voxel were fitted using the FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT, FSL v. 4.0, www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and diffusivity parallel ( 1) and perpendicular (( 2  3)2) to the principal diffusion direction (RD) were computed for the whole brain. In order to reduce the possible errors arising from misalignment of the images, we used the Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) method 26. All subjects FA data were aligned into a common space that was chosen to be the best target from all FA images (an algorithm included in the TBSS package), using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (http: fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwikiFNIRT), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field. A mean FA skeleton was derived from the mean FA image that represents the centres of all tracts common to the group. Each subjects aligned FA data was then projected onto this skeleton and thresholded at 0.2 FA. The resulting data were fed into voxel-wise cross-subject statistics. Modelling and inference using standard general linear model (GLM) design set-up was accomplished using permutation-based cluster analysis (5000 permutation) 30 as implemented in FSL. The design encoded for group membership. For statistical inference Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancing (TFCE) approach was used 31.\nIn case of all Alzheimer and NPH patients the lateral ventricles, the 3rd ventricle and the Sylvian fissures were masked manually on the high-resolution T1-weighted images. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes estimated from these masks were fed into TBSS analysis to reveal voxel-wise correlation between the CSF volumes and diffusion metrics. A separate group-specific skeleton was used for each group.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We found that there are measurable differences in WM microstructure in NPH as compared to AD and normal controls. The most characteristic changes in NPH were the increased FA in the cortico-fugal tracts adjacent to the lateral ventricles, along with increased MD and 1. In contrast, posterior callosal WM pathways had reduced FA paralleled with increased RD. Furthermore, increased lateral ventricular volume negatively correlated with the FA of the frontal white matter in AD and 3rd ventricular volume positively correlated with the FA of the frontal and parietal periventricular white matter in NPH.\nOur results are in line with previous DTI studies in NPH patients. Hattori et al. 20 in a combined TBSS-and ROI-based investigation found increased FA in the internal capsule and in corticospinal tracts, along with decreased FA in the periventricular WM and posterior parts of the splenium. Also using the combined TBSS and ROI approach, Hattingen et al. 22 reported significantly lower FA and higher MD values in corpus callosum, along with higher FA and MD values in the periventricular corticospinal tract. Accordingly, Kanno et al. 21 in a VBM style analysis showed increased MD in the periventricular regions and lower FA in the corpus callosum and the subcortical regions. Recently, similar results were presented in NPH patients before VP-shunting 27. Moreover our results are also in line with a recent DTI study on a rodent model of hydrocephalus, regionally heterogonous diffusion alterations were detected in the WM in kaolin-induced hydrocephalus 32.\nThe reduction of FA in the corpus callosum and posterior periventricular WM fibres in NPH could be explained with mechanical pressure on the callosal and periventricular fibres that cause axonal degeneration 13. Furthermore, induced CSF effusion into the periventricular WM due to increased pressure, resulting in extracellular oedema also significantly contribute to the altered diffusion parameters 33. A further explanation could be that the stretching of the ventricles may cause predominantly anteroposterior stretching of the fibres in the body of corpus callosum and cranio-caudal stretching of the fibres in the splenium. In either case the stretching is perpendicular to the main fibre direction in the corpus callosum that could lead to reduced FA and increased RD 25.\nWe propose two alternative hypotheses for the increased FA that is mainly result of the increase of 1 in the periventricular cortico-fugal fibres. One possibility is that the increased mechanical pressure arising from the reduced CSF turnover may stretch the ventricles and compress the WM fibres, which in turn will reduce the winding of the fibres within a voxel, resulting in increased water diffusivity parallel to fibres. Alternatively, the degeneration of crossing fibres that are running through the corpus callosum (the region where reduced FA was found) will reduce the perpendicular diffusivity. However, since no reduction of the perpendicular diffusivity was measured here, this second hypothesis seems less likely.\nAD is the most important differential diagnosis for NPH and is sometimes described as NPH comorbidity. Our study reported higher MD in parieto-temporal WM in AD patients when compared to controls, consistently with the pattern known from previous DTI studies 34. High MD values indicate reduced axonal fibre calibre and increased amount of extracellular space, as a result of increased CSF diffusion into interstitial periventricular space, along with possibly increased intraparenchymal CSF production and decreased brain perfusion 25,35. Regional changes were more significant for the left hemisphere; however, they were displayed also on the right, when the statistical threshold has been lowered.\nIn our study, no significant change in FA was detected in AD patients. That is in contrast to former TBSS analyses on AD patients that reported FA reduction in various locations. Most of these studies however used a more liberal statistical threshold 36,37, or much higher gradient directions to define diffusion parameters 38. Whereas no significant FA differences were found between AD patients and normal controls, we reported an increase of 1 in the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes in AD patients. Increased 1 can be explained by increased extra-axonal space due to reduced axonal density and faster diffusion parallel to axons 39. According to Kim et al. 40, 1 changes may simply describe axonal damage occurring secondarily to Wallerian degeneration. In our recent study using a novel model free approach, the increased 1 was A few studies used diffusion parameters to differentiate NPH patients from other types of dementias. Kanno et al. 21 performed a VBM style comparative study between NPH, AD and Parkinson disease (PD) patients. It also showed that MD was significantly higher in the periventricular WM in NPH patients as compared to either AD or PD patients. In their investigation, in the left subcortical frontal WM MD was found to be higher in AD and PD patients as compared to NPH. The most significant reduction of FA was in the splenium corpus callosum in NPH as compared to AD or PD patients, which also very similar to our findings. Using the data of a control group in our analysis we also have been able to disentangle the direction of change in the different patient populations of the various diffusion parameters. Recently, Hattori et al. 25 in a tract specific ROI based analysis showed increased FA and 1 in the corticospinal tract in NPH patients. This feature was shown to have a sensitivity of 94 and specificity of 80 when differentiating from AD or Parkinsons disease patients 25. In another study, using tractspecific analysis Hattori implied different pathogeneses for fornix damage between NPH and AD patients, presenting significantly lower FA values in both NPH and AD, with differences concerning the length of the fornix (greater in NPH, but not altered in AD) 24.\nA further important finding of our study is the correlation between diffusion parameters and external and internal CSF volumes. In AD the enlargement of the ventricles is thought as an ex vacuo process, hence the reduction of FA that correlates with the ventricular enlargement might be seen as a signature of neurodegeneration. Contrary, the positive correlation between the periventricular FA and the size of the third ventricle points to a mechanical effect arising from the increased pressure in the ventricles. These findings might also call attention to the size of the third ventricle in the diagnosis of NPH between the various CSF volumes and indices 41.\nEarlier TBSS analyses compared NPH patients to controls 20,22,27, but comparison to other diseases with similar clinical and neuroradiological features is missing. We used TBSS analysis as there is no need for specific ROIs, which represents the limitation by selecting specific part of the WM fibres in the brain. TBSS represents a more uniform approach, as there is a presumption of the more general effect on the cerebral WM through dilated ventricular system. Furthermore, TBSS as compared to former voxel-wise morphometric analyses, has the advantage of reducing errors arising from the possible misalignments in the WM that has a key importance in our patients population where gross brain configuration is altered. Similar to our results, earlier TBSS studies using backprojection from the skeleton had confirmed successful registration in most of the brain. Although misalignment issues are resolved with TBSS approach to some extent, huge anatomical deformation due to ventricles enlargement are still problematic in NPH 20. In our study we further improved the registration by using a single image (an AD patients image) instead of the normal standard space template and visual inspection further ensured the result of registrations. Furthermore the regions where misregistration happened were excluded from the analysis.\nProbably the biggest drawback of the voxelwise intersubject analysis (one of which is TBSS) is that intersubject image registration, tissue segmentation, smoothing, and other postprocessing steps are required. Recently, parametric model fitting for the shape of a whole-brain MD histogram was developed 35 and presented as a useful approach for differential diagnosis for NPH and AD, omitting the need for intersubject registration. However, this method lacks the spatial information, which looking at our results, could be a key feature of diffusion parameter alterations. Also the combined use of various diffusion parameters such as FA, MD, 1 and RD enrich the information used to differentiate between various pathologies.\nOne problem with the DTI approach is its clinical feasibility. Diffusion-tensor images require time-consuming postprocessing and statistical steps before a diagnosis can be considered. This makes clinical application challenging. Nevertheless, diffusiontensor imaging is considered to be a very powerful approach to evaluate WM alterations. Furthermore, it would be important to do DTI in patients post-shunt to validate normalisation of DTI measures in those patients that responded.\nIn our study, TBSS analysis of diffusion data showed a specific patter of diffusion parameter changes in NPH that can differentiate it from AD and healthy controls. Our findings support the utility of non-invasive DTI in differential diagnosis of NPH and prediction of success of VP shunting. The challenge for future research is to perform a follow up study after VP shunt insertion and to assess the diffusion characteristics against the clinical course and other diagnostic markers of NPH.",

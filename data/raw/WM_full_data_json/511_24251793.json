    "abstract": "Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD). It is therefore important to identify biomarkers of conversion to AD. This study examined whether the integrity of white matter can predict this conversion. METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological features of aMCI subjects (n  41) were compared with normal controls (n  20) for 12-36 months. RESULTS Compared to controls, 22 aMCI subjects had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the cingulate fasciculus (CF) at baseline, and 19 of those converted to AD during followup. Only two of the other 19 aMCI patients converted to AD. Compared to baseline, AD converters showed lower FA values in the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, inferior fronto-occipital fascicles, corpus callosum genu and CF, and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS Those aMCI subjects with lower than normal FA values in the CF were more likely to convert to AD. The connectivity of the hippocampus and cingulate bundles may be affected in the early stage of AD. Impairment of white matter and fiber bundles was more severe at the AD stage than the aMCI stage.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a transitional stage between normal aging and early dementia. 1 Subjects with aMCI are at higher risk of developing AD. It is therefore important to identify predictive biomarkers of conversion to AD. Compared to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers, 2 a noninvasive imaging marker is more appealing for the screening of aMCI patients to establish those at greater risk of conversion to AD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that combines diffusion-weighted pulse\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. sequences with tensor mathematics to measure molecular diffusion in three dimensions. White matter tracking using DTI enables the noninvasive tracking of neuronal fiber bundles based on diffusion anisotropy of the water molecules in white matter. 3 Two complementary parameters obtained from DTI measurements are apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), which are influenced by changes in the tissue microenvironment and provide quantitative measures of directionally averaged diffusion. These parameters can be used to assess the degradation of white matter and fiber tracts in the brain, and have therefore been applied to the study of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. The integrity of the white Copyright  C 2013 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 343 matter has been shown to differ between patients with AD and controls in several brain regions. 4567 In addition, a small number of DTI studies have shown microscopic white matter changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 4,5,8910 A number of recent studies have examined different predictors of conversion from MCI to AD using neuropsychological tests, MRI, or CSF biomarkers. 1,9,111213 In the current longitudinal study, the microstructural damage (estimated by DTI) and the DTI indexes of microstructural damage were compared in patients at the aMCI and AD stage, using a group of healthy elderly volunteers as normal controls (NCs). The study aimed to test whether the integrity of the white matter fiber tracts in aMCI patients can predict conversion to AD.",

      "text": "Forty-one patients diagnosed with aMCI were consecutively recruited from a memory impairment clinic (Department of Neurology, Shanghai Sixth Peoples Hospital, which is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University) between June 2008 and June 2010. Twenty healthy NCs, who were rigorously matched with patients in terms of age, gender and education, were recruited from the same geographical area. For all participants, the clinical assessment consisted of the following: (1) a medical, psychiatric and neurological history; (2) a list of current medications; and (3) a physical and neurological examination. The neuropsychological examination included the minimental state examination (MMSE), 14 the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 15 the clinical dementia rating (CDR) 16 and the modified Hachinski ischemic scale (HIS). 17 Patient histories were collected from reliable individuals with knowledge of the patient, who were usually relatives. The demographic and clinical data of participants are listed in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the two NC and aMCI with respect to variables such as demographics and health characteristics.\nInclusion criteria for the NCs were (1) 5) MMSE score between 24 and 27, and MoCA score between 15 and 24, or a CDR score of .5. Exclusion criteria were as follows: age  80 years, a history of overt depression or other psychiatric diseases; significant cerebrovascular disease; a modified HIS score of 4; or a lack of any daily living activity.\nAs part of an ongoing study, neuropsychological assessments were performed four times over the course of a year: at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. For NCs and nonconverters, MRI scans were investigated twice: at the start of the study and at the end of follow-up period. An additional MRI scan was performed on aMCI converters, after the AD diagnosis had been made. The median number of months between the initial diagnosis of aMCI and the subsequent diagnosis of AD in converters was 21.00 (interquartile range p25-p75 values  12.00-27.00).\nThe study procedures were undertaken according to the guidelines of the hospital research ethics committee. All participants signed written informed consent forms.",

      "text": "None of the subjects had any metal implants in the body or any other contraindication to MRI. All 41 participants underwent the same imaging protocol using a 3.0 Tesla Allegra MR scanner (3.0T Achieva, Philips Medical System, Best, The Netherlands) with an eight-channel phased array head coil. This protocol included whole-brain T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), diffusionweighted scanning, and standard clinical sequences (T2, fluidattenuated inversion recovery FLAIR) Patients with small The various association tracts were identified based on standard atlases. Post-processing FiberTrak software (Philips Medical System) 21,22 was used to measure FA and ADC values in different layers of B0 map and color-coded map of the axial and coronal images. In the color-coded maps, red represents left and right, green represents before and after, and blue represents top and bottom. Regions of interest (ROIs) of 15-25 pixels (48-80 mm 2 ) were placed into the following white matter regions: the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, hippocampus (Fig. 1). For most regions, we used the ROI designations described by Fellgiebel et al. 23 (Fig. 2). These ROIs included: the inferior fronto-occipital fascicles (IFOF), genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (GCC, SCC), superior longitudinal fasciculus II (SLF-II), and the cingulate fasciculus (CF). The size of the ROIs was dependent on the anatomical region studied. The nonmidline regions were measured on both sides. The rater, an experienced neuroradiologist who was blinded to the clinical diagnosis of all the participants, defined the placements of ROIs for FA and ADC measurements.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In addition to clinical features and neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging studies play an important role in the early diagnosis of aMCI and AD. In this longitudinal study, DTI data from aMCI patients were examined in order to detect the white matter abnormalities between AD converters and nonconverters. Two main findings were noted. First, compared to aging controls, disturbances were found in cingulum fibers in aMCI patients. Second, compared to aMCI nonconverters, widespread regions of the brain were found to have a lower FA values in aMCI converters. In addition, increased ADC values were found in the temporal lobe and hippocampus of aMCI converters. Overall, the findings of this investigation indicate that microstructural damage of multiple association fiber tracts may occur at different times in the course of AD thus may be differentially sensitive.\nIn line with previous studies, 3,232425262728 reduced FA values were found in the cingulum fibers of aMCI patients. However, most of these studies indicated that DTI of the posterior cingulate region was able to discriminate MCI from cognitively normal individuals, but our results showed no differences between groups in the symmetric regions. The discrepancy between these finding and the results of the current study might be due to differences in the study group or technical differences. The cingulum fibers, which connect the hippocampus and the posterior of the cingulum bundle, are related to the pathological process of AD. Abnormal FA in the cingulum bundle reflects the greater susceptibility of the cortical cognitive system, which is related to impairment of the cholinergic conductional pathway. It has been suggested that the basal forebrain cholinergic system is associated with learning and memory, and is the first region to be impaired in aMCI patients. Nineteen of the 22 (86.36) aMCI patients with lower FA values clinically converted to a diagnosis of AD during the follow-up period. Thus, abnormal FA observed in the cingulum may be a sensitive parameter by which to predict the conversion from aMCI to AD. Compared to aMCI nonconverters, aMCI converters had reduced FA in multiple areas. The decrease of prefrontal lobe and temporal lobe white matter anisotropy may be due to early temporal-to-frontal disconnections. The IFOF represent the only direct connection between the occipital and frontal lobes, and the CF is adjacent to the parahippocampal cortex and provides connections to prefrontal cortical areas. 29 Those changes indicate that there is regional specificity to the degradation of axon integrity and loss of cortical connections. Alternative explanations include small vessel alterations, demyelination of axonal structures, loss of axonal structure and possibly gliosis, which reduce directional diffusion and may contribute to reduced FA. 3,30 The above results are in line with some other studies 8,29 and suggest that the progression of AD initially implicates the medial temporal structures (the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus), followed by the temporal cortex, then the posterior parietal lobe, and finally the different levels of the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex are involved.\nIn the current study, aMCI converters showed increased ADC values in the temporal lobe and hippocampus compared with aMCI nonconverters. This may indicate that involvement of the hippocampus and temporal lobe occurs early on during the pathological progression of AD. ADC is derived from diffusion-weighted MR images and describes the basic diffusion properties of the tissue. The pathological disruption of cell membranes, and the loss of myelin (affecting axonal processes), reduces the restrictions on the movement of water, and therefore the diffusivity expressed as the ADC would be expected to increase. 31,32 In order to eliminate subjective errors, an experienced neuroradiologist who was blind to the clinical diagnosis of all participants defined ROIs following strict criteria. However, our study had some limitations. First, we used anisotropic voxels in the DTI, which might have caused a bias in the calculation of FA. Second, the fact that patients with T2 hyperintensities were excluded may have introduced some bias into the results. Third, the sample size of the study was small, and future studies should use larger groups of patients.\nIn summary, DTI could (in addition to traditional imaging and neuropsychological testing), serve as a sensitive technique for the early detection of white matter changes in aMCI and AD patients. Moreover, depending on which parts of the white matter and fiber tracts are involved, DTI scans may provide a sensitive index of the likelihood of clinical conversion to AD for aMCI patients.",

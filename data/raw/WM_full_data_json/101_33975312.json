Using high-resolution ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated microstructural changes in the white and grey matter in the P301L mouse model of human tauopathy at 8.5 months of age.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration and frontotemporal dementia including frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and Picks disease are characterized by the progressive formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 1,2. NFTs are intracellular neuronal lesions composed of insoluble, conformationally abnormal, hyperphosphorylated accumulations of tau in neurons and glia 2. The presence of NFTs in the brain triggers a complex cascade of biochemical and cellular processes that result in neurodegeneration and neuronal loss 2. The occurrence of NFTs correlates well with spatial patterns of neuronal loss and is related to the degree of cognitive deficits 3,4.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to non-invasively characterize tissue changes in the brain associated with tau pathology. Structural MRI studies have shown that NFT deposition is associated with grey matter atrophy that results from neurodegeneration and that different tauopathies display distinctive regional patterns of grey matter atrophy 5678. In addition, white matter changes such as white matter atrophy and the occurrence of white matter hyperintensities have been reported 9. Such observations are indicative of white matter damage and demyelination caused by axonal tau pathology 10. Despite their usefulness, structural MRI provides little information about the underlying neurodegenerative changes in the brain.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging is a MRI technique that probes the directional diffusivity of water molecules and can, thus, yield information about the microstructural properties of brain tissue 111213. Diffusion imaging data are commonly analysed using a tensor model, that is, by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 14. DTI shows sensitivity to axon and myelin pathology, where breakdown of white matter integrity results in measurable differences in diffusion of water molecules 15,16. DTI has been widely used to assess white matter abnormalities related to tau pathologies 17181920212223. A few DTI studies have also reported changes in diffusivity in the grey matter 24,25. Importantly, DTI microstructural changes seem to precede gross anatomical changes seen on structural MRI 24.\nGenetic studies show that the development of neurodegenerative tauopathies is associated with missense mutations in the microtubule-associated tau protein (MAPT) 26. Based on this finding, transgenic mouse lines with MAPT mutations gene including P301S 27 and P301L 28293031 have been developed. Some models have the advantage of tetracycline-controlled transcriptional suppression of tau 31. Histological studies have demonstrated deposition of NFTs pathology, in particular, in the cortex (CRX) and hippocampus and marked atrophy of these areas 272829303132. Behavioural analysis revealed cognitive deficits in learning and motor tasks 30,31.\nTransgenic mouse models of tauopathy have been used in MRI studies 333435363738. Previous DTI studies assessing microstructural changes in rTg4510 mice, which express transgenic tau P301L mutations driven by a Ca 2  calmodulin kinase II promoter system 30,31 in the white and grey matter produced conflicting results 33343536. Thus, we wished to determine DTI metrics in transgenic P301L mice, which express tau under the control of the murine Thy 1.2 promoter 28,29. In the present study, we used ex vivo DTI to assess microstructural changes in 8.5-month-old P301L mice in both white and grey matter regions. We leveraged the ability of long data acquisitions that are possible in ex vivo DTI to achieve a high spatial resolution, without suffering from image corruption due to motion or breathing that are common in in vivo DTI 12,13. We implemented a pipeline for voxel-based analysis (VBA) and atlas-based analysis (ABA) for unbiased computational analysis of DTI mouse brain data. To test for gene-dose-dependent effects, we assessed both hemizygous and homozygous P301L mice and compared them with non-transgenic littermates. We hypothesized that effects on DTI microstructural parameters would be stronger in homozygotes than in hemizygotes because of the stronger tau transgene expression in homozygous P301L mice.",

To normalize images to an atlas space, SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, UK) together with the SPM Mouse toolbox (University of Oxford, UK) were used. For each scan, the b0 image was normalized to the mouse atlas space using the SPM normalize and segment tool. Further, the Allen mouse brain atlas (http:mouse.brain-map.org staticatlas) was also non-linearly registered to the atlas space to enable the VBA and ABA. Maximization of the mutual information was used for image registration. Mutual information or relative entropy is a widely used similarity measure in medical image registration 41. As we maximize the mutual information, the information from the combined images is minimized compared to 2 separate images. All considered microstructural maps (FA, MD, RD, and AD) were finally warped to atlas space for VBA and ABA. To evaluate if the registration was done properly, we visually inspected images after registration with SPM, overlaying one image on the top of another. Registration for VBA and ABA was found to be done properly.",

      "text": "DTI has been previously used in patient studies to assess microstructural changes related to tau pathologies 171819202122232425. Application of DTI to animal models of tauopa-thy may be useful for validation and mechanistic studies and monitoring of tau-targeted therapies. Previously, DTI has been applied to characterize brain tissue changes in the rTg4510 strain 33343536 but produced varied results. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of tau pathology on DTI metrics in the P301L models of human tauopathy.\nWe acquired ex vivo DTI data in 8.5-month-old hemizygous and homozygous P301L mice and age-matched non-transgenic littermates. VBA revealed microstructural changes in both white and grey matter regions in homozygotes but not in hemizygotes P301L mice. ABA showed that decreased FA in most brain regions, while MD, RD, and AD were increased in homozygous P301L mice compared to hemizygous and non-transgenic littermates.\nIn contrast to previous studies where DTI in mice was performed in vivo 33343536, we performed ex vivo DTI. Compared to the in vivo setting, ex vivo DTI has the advantage that it is not hampered by motion artefacts, for example, breathing. It also allows for prolonged scanning times. We acquired 3D data with 100 μm isotropic resolution in 9 h 45 min. We measured complete head samples, which preserve the structural integrity of the brains 35 in a high-field small-bore magnet with radiofrequency coils 42 to obtain diffusion data with suffi- Mean  SD; AD, RD, and MD values are in units of 10 -3 mm 2 s.

Nevertheless, ex vivo DTI requires chemical fixation with formaldehyde to preserve the tissue and the procedure alters the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the tissue. For example, a study by Ma et al. 43 has shown that most of the white structures demonstrated significantly larger ex vivo volumes after fixation than in vivo volumes (i.e., internal capsule and fimbria) except for the smallest white matter structure (e.g., AC), which was significantly smaller ex vivo. Conversely, grey matter structures (e.g., neocortex, TH, and hippocampus) decreased in volume. Fixation does alter the magnitude of water diffusion in the tissue, but measures of the directionality of diffusion are less affected 444546. The subsequent placement of samples in PBS removed excess fixative and, while it does not reverse the chemical effects of fixation, it has been shown to partially restore diffusivity of the tissue 46. As samples are equally treated, the volume changes induced by fixation do not hamper advanced, unbiased computational approaches and allow detection of anatomical phenotypes in transgenic animals. The reduced diffusivity of fixed tissue requires strong gradients for strong diffusion weighting. These are commonly available in small-bore animal scanners. We used a b-value of 4,000 smm 2 , as recommended for ex vivo DTI 47.\nPrevious studies have used ROI analysis 33343536, while we opted for VBA and ABA for statistical analysis of DTI data. For ROI analysis, selected areas are manually drawn, which is more time consuming, requires a priori anatomical localization, and is prone to bias 48. Moreover, in many neurodegenerative diseases, microstructural changes occur across the whole brain, and conventional ROI analysis may miss to detect changes in areas that are not selected 49. VBA has been widely used in structural MRI as an unbiased approach to assess morphological changes of tissue 43,50. Voxel-by-voxel statistical comparison is performed once all brain images are normalized to a template space, with the assumption that each individual voxel represents the same anatomical location of the brain 49,51,52.\nThe spatial normalization of the brains in VBA was based on scalar image-based registration, incorporating 12-parameter affine transformation and diffeomorphic mapping, which is essentially done to match internal brain structures to the template. One may apply a lowpass filter to smooth normalized images; however, the fact, if the particular location is the same voxel in other images, is still questionable due to the potential atrophy in the brain 51. Smoothing in DTI is also challenging due to thin tracts of white matter and heterogeneity of the FA maps. Nevertheless, this method is still in use in biomedical imaging due to its simplicity 50. Besides, its statistical power is poor due to the high level of noise.\nWith VBA, we found marked changes when comparing homozygous P301L mice with non-transgenic littermates, while we did not observe differences between hemizygous transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates. The comparisons demonstrated that changes in DTI metrics are gene-dose dependent, where mice with the stronger tau transgene expression (i.e., homozygous P301L mice) show the phenotype. This finding is in line with the results of the ABA where differences in DTI metrics were found between homozygous P301L mice and homozygous and non-transgenic littermates. It may be speculated that use of larger group sizes or animals of older ages might have also revealed differences between hemizygous P301L and non-transgenic animals, as the hemizygous mice also have tau pathology.\nWhile the VBA revealed areas of significant changes in DTI metrics, it does not inform about the direction of the changes. Thus, we used ABA to obtain regional values of FA, MD, RD, and AD. ABA analysis is based on automatic segmentation of brain regions defined in the atlas after normalization 51525354. This provides high sensitivity to small and widely distributed changes, but it fails when the regions are not within the anatomical boundaries of the predefined atlas 54. Results from ABA revealed a decrease in FA and increased MD, RD, and AD values in the CC compared to non-transgenic littermates, while other white matter regions were unchanged. An earlier study by Sahara et al. reported age-dependent changes in DTI metrics in rTg4510 mice 33. A decrease in FA values was noted in the CC, AC, internal capsule, splenium, and fimbria of 8-month-old rTg4510 mice. RD was found increased in the CC, splenium, and fimbria, while MD and AD were unchanged. A study by Colgan et al. 36 found lower FA values and higher MD in the CC of 8.5-month-old rTg4510 mice than in non-transgenic littermates. A study by Wells et al. reported increased RD values in the CC in rTg4510, while FA, MD, and AD were not different from non-transgenic littermates 34.\nDTI is also increasingly used to assess microstructural changes in the grey matter 55. In our study, we found decreased FA values and increased MD, RD, and AD values in the HPRs, CRX, and TH in homozygous P301L mice compared to non-transgenic controls. A previous study by Wells et al. 34 reported increased FA and MD in the CRX and hippocampus of rTg4510 mice. In the TH, the MD was found increased, while the FA was un- 35 reported increased FA and MD in the CRX and hippocampus of rTg4510 mice. In the TH, FA was increased, while MD was not different. In a study by Colgan et al. 36, MD was increased in the hippocampus and CRX. FA was higher in the hippocampus but was not different in the CRX. No change in FA and MD has been observed in the TH.\nDifferences in DTI metrics in cross-sectional studies in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy based on MAPT mutations may arise due to the use of different strains, that is, the type of tau mutation, promoter of transgene expression, transgene expression levels, genetic background, and housing conditions 56, which are known to affect the phenotype. Furthermore, methodological differences in DTI data acquisition (in vivo vs. ex vivo and sequence parameters) and different analysis methods (ROI, VBA, ABA etc.) may contribute to the observed differences in studies. We made FA, MD, RD, and AD maps and analysis code publicly available, which enable other groups to perform an independent analysis with our data, to validate the code, and to enable of image-based meta-analysis. Finding converging patterns of microstructural changes or identifying different phenotypes between different tau mouse models compared to clinical studies would increase the translational value of preclinical DTI studies. In this regard, the observed pattern of decreased FA and increased MD, RD, and AD values in P301L mice in the current study are in good agreement with DTI changes observed in human tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy 21, frontotemporal dementia 22, mild cognitive impairment 24, and Alzheimers disease 18,25.\nEffects of tauopathy on DTI metrics in the grey and white matter are complex and may involve axonal damage, myelin injury, neuronal degeneration, and gliosis, which all have been found in tauopathies 17,18,23,25,28,29,33,38,57. The interpretation of changes in the measured diffusion tensor is thus awaiting histological determination. Furthermore, future studies may seek to examine microstructural changes in vivo in a longitudinally designed study. For example, it would be important to determine the onset of changes in DTI and how this is related to gross anatomical changes and cognitive function. Studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment have shown that changes in DTI metrics in the hippocampus, a region involved in working memory formation can predict cognitive decline and constitute a more sensitive predictor than changes in hippocampal volume 24. Given the limitations of DTI, more advanced models for reconstruction diffusion MRI data may be explored 12,36,58.\nIn summary, ex vivo DTI demonstrated brain-wide and gene-dose-dependent microstructural changes in the P301L mouse model of human tauopathy, similar to what has been observed in patients with tauopathies. The DTI analysis pipeline may serve for the phenotyping of models of tauopathy and other brain diseases.",

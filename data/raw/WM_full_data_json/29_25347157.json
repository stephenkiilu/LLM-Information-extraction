    "abstract": "Importance-Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to loss of white matter (WM) integrity and the temporal positioning of biomarkers of WM integrity relative to the biomarkers of gray matter (GM) neurodegeneration and amyloid load in the course of AD are poorly understood. Objective-To investigate the effects of Alzheimers disease (AD)-related GM neurodegeneration and high β-amyloid on white matter (WM) microstructure in non-demented older adults. Design-Longitudinal cohort study Setting -Population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Participants-Participants (n701) with MRIDTI and PET studies diagnosed as cognitively normal (CN; n570) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n131) were included. CN and MCI subjects were divided into biomarker-negative, amyloid-positive only, neurodegenerationpositive only, and amyloid plus neurodegeneration-positive groups based on their amyloid load on 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B PET, AD hypometabolic pattern on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET andor hippocampal atrophy on MRI. Main Outcome Measure-Fractional anisotrophy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) Results-No FA alterations were observed in biomarker-negative MCI, and amyloid-positive only CN and MCI groups. Conversely, neurodegeneration-positive only and amyloid plus neurodegeneration-positive CN and MCI groups consistently had decreased FA in the fornix, which correlated with cognitive performance (Rho0.38; p0.001). Patients with MCI had more extensive WM involvement than CN subjects, and greatest FA decreases were observed in the amyloid plus neurodegeneration-positive MCI group. Conclusions and Relevance-High amyloid load does not influence DTI-based measures of WM integrity in the absence of co-existent GM neurodegeneration in non-demented older adults.",

      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows the profound loss of WM integrity in Alzheimers disease (AD) starting from the prodromal stages 1234567 . Decrease in the directionality of water diffusion measured with fractional anisotropy (FA) on DTI has been linked to loss of myelin and axons in the white matter (WM). 8 According to the biomarker model of AD, 9 and the pre-clinical staging of AD derived from this model, 10 alterations in biomarkers of gray matter (GM) neurodegeneration follow biomarkers of amyloid deposition during the course of disease progression from pre-clinical to clinical dementia. However, the AD-related pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to loss of WM integrity and the temporal positioning of biomarkers of WM integrity relative to the biomarkers of GM neurodegeneration and amyloid load in the course of AD are unknown.\nIn this study, we investigated the FA alterations in cognitively normal older adults (CN) and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from a population-based study on non-demented older adults, who were classified as neurodegeneration andor amyloid-positive or -negative. Our objective was to determine the effects of Alzheimers disease (AD)-related GM neurodegeneration and high β-amyloid on white matter (WM) microstructure in nondemented older adults.",

The MCSA is a prospective population-based study of non-demented older adults in Olmsted County Minnesota 11 . To be included in the current study, non-demented subjects should have participated in MRI, amyloid PET with 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET studies during the same cycle of clinical evaluation. The neuropsychological test scores were scaled such that they had a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0 among all MCSA full participants and averaged to obtain a global cognitive z-score. 11 The diagnosis of MCI was based on the published criteria: cognitive complaint, cognitive function not normal for age, decline in cognition, essentially normal functional activities, and not demented 12 . Diagnosis of dementia was based on the DSM-IV criteria 13 , and patients with dementia were excluded. Diagnosis was determined by a consensus committee including the neurologist, neuropsychologist and the nurse who evaluated each participant, shielded from prior diagnosis. Subjects who had a contraindication for MRI such as a pacemaker, or who were unable to participate in imaging studies because of severe illness were excluded. However, subjects were not excluded due to neurological, psychiatric, or systemic illnesses to preserve the representativeness of the study sample as much as possible.",

A 3D high resolution MPRAGE acquisition was performed for hippocampal volume measurements and for anatomic segmentation and labeling of the DTI and PET scans. Hippocampal volume was measured with FreeSurfer software (version 5.3). 14 We calculated an adjusted hippocampal volume as the residual from a linear regression of hippocampal volume versus total intracranial volume. 15 PET images were acquired using a PETCT scanner (DRX; GE Healthcare) operating in 3D mode. After a 40-min uptake period, a 20-min PiB scan was obtained. The amyloid PET acquisition consisted of four 5-min dynamic frames, acquired from 40 to 60 min after injection. FDG PET images were obtained 1 hour after the PIB scan. PiB PET quantitative analysis was performed using the fully automated image processing pipeline which was previously described in detail 16 . Briefly, a cortical global amyloid PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was obtained by combining the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulateprecuneus ROI values normalized by the cerebellar GM ROI of an atlas 17 modified in-house. FDG PET scans were analyzed in a similar manner using angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal cortical ROIs to define an Alzheimer signature composite by Landau et al. 18 normalized to pons and vermis.\nHippocampal atrophy on MRI andor hypometabolism in the Alzheimer signature composite on FDG PET was used to classify subjects into the neurodegeneration-positive group, and high amyloid load on PET was used to classify subjects into the amyloid-positive group. Cut-points for amyloid positivity, hippocampal atrophy and Alzheimer signature hypometabolism were determined from the 10 th percentile of the measurement distributions in clinically diagnosed AD patients as previously described. 15",

The DTI volumes consisted of 41 diffusion-encoding gradient directions and five volumes of non-diffusion T2-weighted images. The slice thickness was 2.7mm, corresponding to 2.7 mm. isotropic resolution. We used a previously tested and validated method to process DTI scans. 19 Briefly, DTI images were corrected for subject motion and residual eddy current distortion by affine-registering each volumes to the first image volume, which had no diffusion-weighting. Diffusion tensors were fit for extracted voxels using linear least squares optimization and FA images were calculated from the eigenvalues of the tensors using FSL version 4. Advanced normalization tools-Symmetric Normalization (ANTS-SyN) version 1.9.y 20 algorithm was used for generating a study-specific template from all FA images and for non-linear registration of a subjects FA images to the template, and smoothed with a 8mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. All CN and MCI biomarker groups were compared to the biomarker-negative CN group using voxel-based analysis (VBA) on SPM5. 21 A secondary quantitative analysis was performed with the single-subject Johns Hopkins University (JHU) DTI atlas 22 by registering the WM ROIs to the study-specific template using ANTS-SyN and displayed on a rendered single-subject transparent brain for visualization using the MRIcroGL program (http:www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edumricrogl).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In a cohort of non-demented older adults from the community, classified according to the status of neurodegeneration and amyloid biomarkers, loss of WM microstructural integrity on DTI was associated with biomarkers of GM neurodegeneration but not with amyloid biomarker positivity. As expected, MCI subjects had more extensive WM involvement compared to CN subjects. We found consistent decreases in fornix FA both in CN and MCI neurodegeneration-positive groups, which correlated with cognitive performance in the entire cohort.\nHigh amyloid load by itself did not have an effect on the microstructural integrity of the WM in the absence of GM neurodegeneration both in the CN and MCI subjects. Evidence from prospective cohort studies indicate that brain amyloidosis is not a benign process. Those with high amyloid load are at an increased risk for cognitive decline, MCI or dementia 2324252627 . However the effects of β-amyloid on WM appear to be associated with GM neurodegeneration. We found more extensive WM FA decreases in neurodegenerationpositive MCI compared to neurodegeneration-positive CN subjects. In addition, MCI subjects with GM neurodegeneration and amyloid biomarker positivity had more widespread WM FA decreases than MCI subjects with GM neurodegeneration alone. The interaction between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and β-amyloid load and their association with adverse cognitive outcomes in the course of AD have been observed and discussed 28293031 , and are consistent with our observations. There was more WM involvement with high β-amyloid load only in neurodegeneration -positive subjects with MCI compared to the biomarker-negative CN group. However, in the absence of cognitive impairment, high β-amyloid load did not have any additional effect on WM integrity. In preclinical AD, integrity of WM is associated with GM neurodegeneration rather than β-amyloid, however β-amyloid appears to be related to WM integrity as the disease progresses and individuals develop cognitive impairment.\nFornix FA was consistently decreased in the neurodegeneration-positive CN and MCI groups compared to the biomarker-negative CN group. Decreased fornix FA is one of the earliest MRI abnormalities observed in cognitively normal individuals who are at an increased risk for AD. Decreases in fornix FA have been observed in pre-symptomatic carriers of familial AD mutations 32 and in patients with MCI 5,33,34 , which predicted the decline in memory function 5 . Fornix carries the efferent projections from the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and subiculum, connecting these structures to the septal nuclei, anterior thalamic nucleus, mammillary bodies and medial hypothalamus. Fornix also carries the afferent cholinergic and GABAergic projections from the medial septal nuclei and the adjacent diagonal band back to the medial temporal lobe, interconnecting the core limbic structures 35 . FA measurements from the body of fornix are further protected from the noise of crossing fibers, which makes fornix an ideal anatomic structure for assessing microstructural changes with DTI. Because fornix carries the axons projecting from the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, integrity of the fornix is in-part linked to the integrity of the hippocampus 36 . In keeping with that, we found significantly reduced fornix FA in subjects with hippocampal atrophy. But in addition, fornix FA was decreased in subjects with reduced metabolism in the AD signature composite regions on FDG PET, even in the absence of hippocampal atrophy. The association of DTI-based WM integrity biomarkers with GM neurodegeneration biomarkers is consistent with previous reports on the association of decreased WM FA with GM hypometabolism and atrophy. 37,38,39 We found correlations between lower fornix FA and lower cognitive performance in the entire cohort and in the CN subjects, but this relationship was weaker in MCI subjects. The neuropathology underlying MCI is heterogeneous. While the most common etiology underlying MCI is AD, vascular and Lewy body disease pathologies in addition to AD are common. 404142 These additional pathologies may have a significant impact on cognitive performance in MCI independent of AD-related neurodegeneration. Thus, the weaker relationship between fornix FA and cognitive performance that we observed in MCI compared to CN subjects may be related to a greater pathologic heterogeneity in MCI that impacts cognitive performance. 42,43 Similarly, WM integrity may be affected by other pathologies commonly found in older adults such as Lewy body disease, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP43, and argyrophilic grain disease along with ADrelated pathology. The interaction of these other pathologies with AD-related pathology and their influence on WM integrity requires further investigation.\nWe did not analyze the data on mean diffusivity, which is significantly effected by partial volume averaging of CSF especially in the fornix that is surrounded by CSF. Although the influence of partial volume averaging of CSF is less on FA, up to 16 of the difference in fornix FA among MCI and CN subjects has been attributed to macrostructural changes in the fornix and associated partial volume averaging of CSF. 44 Therefore a small percentage of the differences in fornix FA we observed among the biomarker groups may be attributed to macrostructural changes. Although we used an optimized DTI sequence for clinical applications, 45 higher angular and spatial resolution that allows effective partial volume correction within clinically applicable time frames may potentially improve DTIs sensitivity to alterations in WM microstructure in pre-clinical AD and MCI.\nData from this study indicate that loss of WM integrity measured with DTI accompanies GM neurodegeneration biomarker abnormalities and not amyloid biomarker positivity in the course of preclinical AD. Putting our findings into context with the preclinical staging of AD, loss of WM integrity on DTI should be observed at Stage 2 along with GM degeneration and amyloid biomarker positivity. However, 21 of the CN subjects did not fit into the preclinical stages of AD because they were classified as neurodegeneration-positive but amyloid-negative, and had FA reductions mostly confined to the fornix. Whether these CN subjects have non-AD related pathology, which we labeled as suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) 15 or a neurodegeneration-first pathway to AD 46 requires further investigation with pathologic confirmation. The scatter plot displays the relationship between Fractional anisotropy of the fornix and global cognitive Z-scores.

The least squares fit for the entire group is shown with a black line.

    "abstract": "Background: Essential tremor (ET) is disease with both motor and non-motor features. Notable among the non-motor features is cognitive impairment. While this impairment has been attributed to cortico-thalamo-cerebellar pathway pathology, it is likely that a more complicated involvement of brain structures underlies cognitive function in ET. Objective: To evaluate the brain microstructural changes of both white matter and grey matter in ET using region of interest based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and to correlate these changes with cognitive function assessed during detailed neuropsychological testing. Method: Thirty-five non-demented ET patients with a range of cognitive function (Clinical Dementia Rating ¼ 0-0.5, mean age ¼ 57.5  16.7 years, age range ¼ 23-76 years) underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging, including DTI. DTI findings were reported as fractional anisotropy, average diffusion coefficient, these values were evaluated for 32 ROIs. Cognitive domains included attention, visuospatial functions, executive function, verbal memory, visual memory, and language. Domain Z-scores were calculated each cognitive domain and compared for each brain region. Results: Microstructural changes in prefrontal cortical areas (dorsolateral, ventrolateral), paralimbic and limbic structures (posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, hippocampus), basal ganglia (substantia nigra, putamen, caudate nucleus) and white matter bundles (corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, longitudinal fasciculus, frontooccipital fasciculus, etc.) correlated with specific domains of cognitive function in ET patients. Conclusion: These data suggest that not only the cerebello thalamocortical pathway, but numerous other brain structures are related to level of cognitive performance and possibly underlie cognitive dysfunction in ET.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in adults, yet it is still one of the least understood 1. In the past two decades, a growing number of studies has increased our understanding of the non-motor symptoms (NMS) of ET 2,3. Notable among these non-motor symptoms is cognitive impairment (CI) 456789. Studies of CI in ET have reported a mild attentional and executive dysfunction accompanying this disorder. Considering the increasing evidence linking ET to a disordered cerebellum 101112, these cognitive deficits have been attributed to (1) a deficit in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (cerebello-thalamo-frontal network), and (2) the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) 6. Further support for this notion comes from neuroimaging studies. Single-photon emission tomography studies in ET have demonstrated a correlation between neuropsychological test scores that are sensitive to frontal lobe function and bilateral frontal hypoperfusion 13. Impairment of working memory has been associated with altered connectivity between the cerebellum and the DLPFC 14. Yet there is a growing sense that the cerebellum by itself and the cerebellothalamo-cortical network might explain only a portion of ET-related CI 6 that which is on the milder end of the spectrum 15,16. ET has also been associated with broader cognitive deficits involving numerous domainsattention, executive functions, several types of memory (working memory, immediate, short term, delayed), visuospatial functions and language, which can advance to the level of dementia 17,18.\nNeuroimaging studies have mainly focused on the underlying neuroanatomical basis of motor symptoms in ET 192021, and fewer than a handful have touched on the issue of CI in ET. In a study that evaluated cortical volume loss and cognitive decline in 25 ET patients vs. 25 healthy controls, grey matter volume (GMV) loss was observed in ET with CI vs. controls in the cerebellum (anterior and posterior lobes) and medial frontal gyrus. The researchers, however, also found that performance on neuropsychological tests was significantly correlated with GMV of the medial frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, occipital lobe, lentiform nucleus, insular and cingulate cortices and cerebellar posterior lobe in ET patients with CI compared to ET patients without CI 22. Another brain volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed that the degree of cognitive decline in ET was proportional to the severity of thalamic, cerebellar cortex, and white matter volume reduction 23. One drawback of volumetric MRI studies is that the damage cannot be detected until the macro level is reached. Functional MRI has also been used to examine the relationship between brain changes and cognitive decline. Functional connectivity changes within the cerebellar network and between the cerebellar network and the anterior and posterior default mode networks were found to be correlated with cognitive behavior in ET patients 24.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the detection of microstructural brain changes, providing information about directional homogeneity of water diffusion (fractional anisotropy, FA) and average magnitude of molecular displacement by diffusion (average diffusion coefficient, ADC). In the setting of neurodegeneration, FA values typically decrease and in the presence of neuroinflammation sometimes can have the opposite effect on FA. This technique is valuable in that it allows the detection of subtle changes in tissue even at the micro level 25.\nDTI methods were used to evaluate the relationship between white matter structures and CI in only two prior studies in ET. In the first study, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on DTI images was used to characterize the white matter microstructural correlates of cognitive performance in ET. The results revealed microstructural changes of the bilateral frontal-parietal white matter 26 (Table 1). However, they did not report any significant results included FA values. A second study also used TBSS and found correlations between cognitive scores and bilateral posterior corona radiata, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix (cres)stria terminalis, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, both internal capsules, and left posterior thalamic radiation DTI values. There was no statistically significant correlation between FA values and any of the cognitive domain scores 27 (Table 1). Both studies did not find any significant difference in any of the diffusion measures for comparisons between cognitively unimpaired ET patients and the healthy control (HC) group.\nUsing earlier neuroimaging studies as a foundation, we hypothesized that impairments of the cerebellum and its connections with paralimbic, limbic, basal ganglia, and frontal cortex structures, in addition to white matter bundles, would be associated with decline of cognitive domains in ETthat is, the brain degeneration in ET is not limited to the cerebellum but is more widespread. In our study of non-demented ET patients with a range of cognitive function, we used regions-of-interest (ROI) based DTI to evaluate the relationship between 32 predefined brain structures (Table 2) and five distinct cognitive domains (attention, visuospatial function, executive function, memory verbal memory and visual memory, and language). We aimed to evaluate the brain structural correlates of each cognitive domain. The current study differs from previous studies because it is methodologically different. (i.e. it is the first to use ROI based DTI, thereby allowing us to not only evaluate fiber tracts but numerous brain structures considering TBSS does not evaluate gray matter structures) and it is the first to evaluate both grey and white matter structures despite others examining cognitive function and DTI.",

      "text": "We recruited 81 consecutive patients with tremor between 18 and 76 years old who visited the general explained. Sociodemographic characteristics, family history (firstand second-degree), and duration of disease were recorded. We ruled out other possible causes of tremor using the following blood tests: thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, folate, other biochemical blood tests (e.g. liver and kidney functions), and hemogram. An ophthalmologist examined patients for Kayser-Fleischer rings in those younger than 45 years.\nWe excluded 46 of 81 patients. First, patients with dystonic features, parkinsonian signs, psychogenic tremor, enhanced physiological tremor, or features not commonly found in ET, such as marked tremor asymmetry, were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included the following: vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; anemia; hypo-or hyperthyroidism; history of end-stage liver or kidney disease or end-stage cancer; history of significant head trauma; history of brain surgery or stroke; history of mental disorders or dementia; clinical dementia rating (CDR) 28 scale score  0.5 (CDR administered to all subjects age 65 years or older); any other movement disorders (Parkinson disease, Parkinson plus syndromes, dystonia, etc.);use of tremor-causing medications; use of antipsychotics or any other cognitive function-impairing medications; refusal to participate; left-handedness; or being older than 80 years. Twenty-four patients were excluded for one or more of these reasons. Second, eleven additional patients with ET were unenrolled from the study either because they missed their neuropsychological evaluation appointments, could not be reached during the study period, or did not want to continue the study. Third, after the MRI procedure, eleven additional patients were excluded: two patients with leukoencephalopathy, one patient with a basal ganglia infarction, and eight patients due to motion or field of view issues. After excluding these 46 patients, there were 35 remaining patients who completed neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological evaluations, and these 35 were included in the study results.",

    "Neuropsychological evaluation": {
      "text": "A detailed neuropsychological test battery was designed to assess the different domains of cognition: attention, visuospatial function (VSF), executive function (EF), verbal memory (VeM: immediate recall, IR, and delayed recall, DR), visual memory (ViM: IR and DR), and language (Table 3). The evaluation was 31,32.\nVisuospatial function: The Benton Judgement of Line Orientation (JLO) Test 33 evaluates complex visual perception. Patients are asked to determine the angular positions of 30 pairs of target lines arranged in a semicircle and positioned above a reference number comprising 11 lines numbered 1-11. JLO consists of two forms (H and V) that present the same items in a different order. Both forms maintain an elements degree of difficulty; the easiest ones are at the beginning and the more difficult ones toward the end. Standardization of this test in Turkey was completed by Karakas et al. 34. The ability to recognize unfamiliar faces is evaluated using the Benton Face Recognition Test 35. The test consists of two parts. In part 1, first, a black-and-white photograph of a face is presented to the participant, then the participant is asked to select the matching face from among the 6 faces. In part II, a black and white photograph of the shaded face is presented and the participant has to select 3 matching photos from a series of faces presented in shade and silhouette. The WMS-R Visual Reproduction Test 32,36 consists of 4 cards and the figures on them. The first 3 cards can be viewed for 10 s, and the fourth card for 18 s. After looking at all 4 cards, the cards are closed and the subject is asked to draw these shapes. The WMS-R visual reproduction test evaluates the ability to recall the form, detail, location, or other important features of visual stimuli that have been previously seen. Clock Drawing Test:\nThe participant is asked to draw a clock, place the numbers, and mark the time. In this way researchers can evaluate planning and sorting skills 32.\nExecutive function: The Stroop Test aims to evaluate resistance to interference and capacity to suppress the response tendency. In the Stroop Test, the participant is required to say the color of the word, not what the word means. The Turkish Form 32, which is included in the BILNOT Battery of the Stroop Test, is composed of the original Stroop Test and the Victoria Form. Similarities (The similarities subtest of Wechsler adult intelligence scale-Revised-WAIS-R) 37 requires the participant to indicate the similarities between pairs of things. The test evaluates abstract verbal reasoning. The Verbal Fluency Tests 38 use the letters K, A, and S (English edition: FAS) as well as animal and fruit naming to test complex attention functions.\nMemory: Verbal memory immediate recall (VM-IR) was evaluated by Verbal Memory Processing Test and WMS Logical Memory Test (imm.). The Verbal Memory Processes Test 39 measures verbal learning assessing parameters as follows: the persons instant memory, the process of gaining knowledge, memory retention, recall, and recall processes. The WMS Logical Memory Testis made up of two stories, with the application step consisting of three stages. First, the story is read, and the participant is asked to recall its details. In the second stage, the aspects of the story that the participant does not remember spontaneously are identified through the asking of questions by the person administering the test. The last stage is a long-term recall, where the participant is asked to provide as many details as possible. There is a validated Turkish version of the story 39. Verbal memory delayed recall (VM-DR) was evaluated by the Verbal Memory Processing Test (spontaneous, recognition) and WMS Logical Memory Test (delayed) as is mentioned above 39.\nVisual memory was evaluated by WMS Visual Reproduction Subtest, which consists of two visual memory tests to evaluate immediate and delayed recall of visual memory (with the latter designed to evaluate delayed memory at least 30 min after the visual presentation of figures)(WMS I: immediate recall and WMS II: delayed recall) 32,36.\nLanguage, Boston Naming Test was used to evaluate language function. The test consists of 31 black and white line drawings. The participants are asked to name each item 40,41.",

Before performing DTI, first, routine brain imaging protocol included T1-weighted (T1W) spin echo (TRTE, 46014 ms; NSA, 1; slice thickness 5 mm), T1W with fat suppression (TRTE, 7157.5 ms; NSA, 1; slice thickness 5 mm) without contrast, T2weighted (T2W) turbo spin echo (TRTE, 250080 ms; NSA, 1; slice thickness 5 mm), FLAIR (TRTE, 8000 90 ms; NSA, 1; slice thickness 5 mm) sequences. Then the 3 D T1W volumetric sequences (TRTETI, 12.55 450 ms) without contrast were applied using a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) with an isotropic voxel resolution of 1 mm. Parallel imaging by using generalized auto calibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) with an integrated parallel acquisition technique (iPAT) factor of 2 was applied. The DTI protocol included a single-shot, spin-echo, echo-planar sequence with TR TE, 270089 ms; matrix, 128 Â 128; field of view, 230 mm and slice thickness 5 mm and 64 diffusionencoding directions were used at b ¼ 0 smm2 and b ¼ 1000smm 2 . Parallel imaging by using GRAPPA with an iPAT factor of 3 was applied. Total acquisition time for the DTI sequence is 4 min. FA and ADC maps were generated on a Leonardo console (software version 2.0; Siemens). A semi-automated system was used for region of interest (ROI) based DTI analysis. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were reconstructed on a Leonardo console (software version 2.0; Siemens) utilizing the DTI data. 3 D T1 and T2-weighted images were used as anatomic references at the placement of the ROIs. These images were then matched with the corresponding regions in ADC and FA maps at the same anatomic level. The ROIs were drawn manually on axial colourencoded FA maps in all subjects with simultaneous assessment of an experienced radiologist (H.O.) who identified the adaptation of the sizes and placement of the ROIs by dissecting white matter tracts: Interactive Diffusion tensor imaging teaching atlas 42 (Figure 1).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the last two decades, cognitive abnormalities have been repeatedly described in studies with ET patients, and these range from mild issues through to MCI and dementia. Despite the high prevalence and clinical importance of cognitive dysfunction 43, there is still a paucity of knowledge regarding the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive dysfunction in ET. In this current study, we performed a detailed neuropsychological evaluation on a group of non-demented ET patients with a range of cognitive function, investigating the associations between cognitive function and brain microstructural changes. Our results suggest that alterations in many brain regions including prefrontal cortex (PFC), limbic, paralimbic, basal ganglia and white matter structures are related with level of cognitive function in these ET patients regardless age, gender, and years of education.\nPrevious DTI studies revealed pathology of both motor and non-motor regions in ET patients 4445464748. Although many affected nonmotor regions were shown, there is a little knowledge about the association between these areas and non-motor symptoms of ET, only two previous studies using DTI have aimed to investigate the underlying neuroanatomic basis of cognitive function in ET. They observed an association between cognitive impairment and WM microstructures in ET conducting white matter changes might be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits 26,27 (Table 1). In our study, we assessed brain structures that have connections with the cerebellum, including prefrontal areas, limbic, paralimbic and basal ganglia structures and white matter bundles.\nThe PFC plays a vital role in the control of cognitive processes and lesions of the PFC result in impairments of executive function and certain types of attention 49,50. In addition to this, DLPFC is commonly associated with visual working memory function and control of memory-guided responses 515253. In agreement with previous studies, we found a relationship between impaired integrity of the DLPFC and visual memory. Another cortical structure which we assessed was insula. The role of insula in language has long been known, recently its role in executive functioning has also come to light. We also found correlations between these two cognitive domains and insula 54,55 The cerebellum is increasingly thought to be important in the pathogenesis of ET. This region is engaged in cognitive and affective functioning and has connections with limbic and paralimbic structures which are essential for the integration of cognition and emotion 56. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that cingulate cortex, precuneus, hippocampus and are all affected in the brains of ET patients and researchers have concluded that impairment of these areas might have cognitive and emotional consequences which could explain non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment and depression in the disease 19,20,57. In our study, we built on this previous research by uncovering the connection between cerebellar, limbic and paralimbic structures and impairment of many cognitive domains, including attention, verbal memory, visual memory, and language.\nThe basal ganglia (BG) and the cerebellum are anatomically and functionally linked to the cerebral cortex through a series of well-established circuits. Recent data have demonstrated that the BG and the cerebellum are interconnected at the subcortical level 58. Several studies have shown that BG may also be involved in ET neuropathogenesis 59,60. These structures have a role on motor functions especially motor sequencing, skills and complex actions, but also it is now well established that they contribute to cognition 61. In our study three BG structures; caudate nucleus, substantia nigra and putamen are found to be related to cognitive function.\nOur analysis also revealed changes in some white matter bundles such as anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), SFOF, IFOF, body of CC, splenium of CC. The ATR consists of fibers connecting the mediodorsal thalamus with the prefrontal cortex 62. Mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus has functional connectivity with hippocampus. These connections explain its role in attention, executive function and memory 63. In our study ATR has related with attention and verbal memory (both immediate recall and delayed recall) but not executive functions. We found SLF was related with executive function and verbal memory immediate recall, ILF was related with verbal memory delayed recall in our sample. The SLF is a large bundle which consists of association fibers and connects the frontal cortex with ipsilateral temporal lobe and also to parietal cortex. The SLF is associated with verbal working memory, attention, and visualspatial functions 64. The ILF is another associative white matter bundle that connects the occipital and temporal-occipital areas to the anterior temporal areas through around the lateral ventricle. Impaired microstructural integrity of ILF have shown in sematic dementia and the associations have been reported between ILF and semantic processing, including verbal comprehension 65. Our correlation analysis released an association between visuospatial function and SFOF which connects frontal lobe to ipsilateral parietal lobe and has function in spatial awareness and visuospatial cognition 66. The IFOF connects semantic cortical structures such as the posterior prefrontal cortex and the posterior temporal region to the occipital region for the visual input 67,68. We found a significant relationship between delayed recall of visual memory and IFOF. The CC splenium links regions in the temporo-parieto occipital junction. Visuospatial construction abilities are associated with the splenium 69,70. Benito -Leon et al. have demonstrated impairment of CC splenium in ET patients compared to healthy controls. They also found a relationship between visuospatial dysfunction and CCS as we found 27 (Table 1).\nDuration of tremor and severity of the disease are the important factors on both cognitive status and brain structural changes with the influence of age. Attention and language were the most affected cognitive domains by duration of tremor and severity of the disease. Age was found mostly related with the impairments of DLPC and fornix in ET patients as we observe normal aging brain 71,72. Changes of CC and basal ganglia structures were also affected by duration of tremor and severity of the disease.\nThis study, however, was not without limitations. This is cross-sectional data with no healthy control subjects. A prospective longitudinal study would enable us to better understand the timing of neuroanatomical changes relative to cognitive abnormalities. Comparison with age-matched controls without the disease would allow us to do a more detailed analysis of the disease-specific brain microstructural changes. Still, the current analysis demonstrates significant neuroanatomical changes are related to distinct cognitive domains, supporting the importance of each of the identified regions of interest with its respective cognitive domain 26,27.\nThe study has numerous strengths. First, a detailed neuropsychological test battery was administered in a standardized manner to all participants. Second, it is one of only three DTI studies of cognition in ET and the only to use ROI based DTI, thereby allowing us to not only evaluate fiber tracts but numerous brain structures.",

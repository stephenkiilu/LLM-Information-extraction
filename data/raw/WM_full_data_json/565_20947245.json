    "abstract": "This study performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) histogram analysis and voxel-based analysis (VBA) to detect white matter (WM) damage in patients with vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND) and to determine correlations between DTI histogram-derived measures and cognitive dysfunction in these patients. Materials and methods: Among patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease, 18 patients with VCIND were selected along with 18 age-and sex-matched cognitive-normal subjects. Both groups underwent magnetic resonance and DTI scans, and fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in VBA between the two groups were assessed. Further, mean diffusivity (MD) and FA histograms of WM and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) in each subject were evaluated. Results: Compared to control, the VCIND group showed lower FA values throughout the brain. FA and MD histogram patterns of WM and NAWM were significantly different between the groups. Significant differences were found in all DTI histogram-derived measures, except in the mean FA peak height of WM and mean MD peak location of NAWM. Neuropsychological results (z-scores) were found to be significantly correlated with mean FA peak location, average MD, mean MD peak location of WM, and mean FA peak height, average MD, mean MD peak location of NAWM. Conclusions: Results of VBA and diffusion tensor imaging-based histogram analysis suggest that VCIND patients have more severe damage in WM and NAWM than the control. Thus, the severity of damage in WM and NAWM may be related with cognitive dysfunction in VCIND patients, and DTI histogram analysis can help in further understanding VCIND.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is of interest to clinicians and scientists because of its high prevalence and high cost of treatment, and also because it is potentially preventable. Approximately 64 of patients who have experienced stroke have some degree of cognitive impairment 1,2, and up to a third of them develop frank dementia. A recent study on the lifetime risk of stroke showed that up to 30 of people will eventually experience stroke andor dementia unless preventive measures are taken 3. The current classification of VCI subtypes includes vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND), vascular dementia, and mixed primary neurodegenerative dementia (usually Alzheimers disease, AD) with vascular dementia 4. The term VCIND broadly encompasses cognitive deficits associated with vascular diseases that fall short of a dementia diagnosis to determine whether there is a preclinical state linked to a high risk of dementia progression within the context of VCIND 5. As VCIND is an early stage of VCI, its early detection is important in the potential treatment of vascular dementia 6,7.\nMagnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive in vivo method for characterizing the integrity of anatomical connections and for providing quantitative assessment of the microstructure of white matter (WM) in the brain. The most frequently used DTI measures include mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). However, to date, there is no characteristic manifestation of VCI in MRI images. 8 Thus, the present study performed voxel-based analysis (VBA) and DTI histogram analysis to determine whether there are differences in WM damage between VCIND and subjects with subcortical vascular disease with no cognitive impairment (control group). Further, the correlation between degree of WM damage and cognitive dysfunction in these patients was determined.\n0303-8467 -see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

    "Subjects": {
      "text": "Patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) were recruited from a stroketransient ischemic attack (TIA) clinic. SIVD was defined as subcortical white matter hyperintensity on FLAIR at Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with at least one lacunar infarct. Diagnosis was based on T2-weighted (T2W) images because the patients did not have FLAIR images. All participants received baseline evaluation, including complete sociodemographic and clinical (cognitive, behavioral, neurological, functional, and physical) data collection. Patient histories were collected from knowledgeable informants, usually from their spouses. All patients underwent laboratory examinations and conventional MR for routine investigation of dementia. Exclusion criteria were cerebral hemorrhages, cortical andor corticosubcortical non-lacunar territorial infarcts and watershed infarcts, specific causes of WM lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and brain irradiation), neurodegenerative diseases (including AD and Parkinsons disease), and signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus or alcoholic encephalopathy. Patients with low education level (6 years), severe depression (Hamilton depression rating scale, HDRS  18), other psychiatric co-morbidity or severe cognitive impairment (inability to perform neuropsychological tests), severe claustrophobia, and contraindications to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, metallic foreign bodies) were also excluded. Finally, the 36 patients recruited were subdivided based on cognitive status into a group with subcortical vascular disease with no cognitive impairment (n  18) and a group with vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND, n  18).\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Ren Ji Hospital. All subjects gave their informed, written consent. All procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines.",

    "Neuropsychological assessment": {
      "text": "Neuropsychological assessments were performed within two weeks of the MRI. All subjects did not suffer a new clinical stroke or TIA between MRI and assessment. A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was designed based on a review of relevant published reports. Trail making test A and B, Stroop color word test, verbal fluency (category) test, auditory verbal learning test (short delayed and long delayed free recall), Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (delayed recall), Boston naming test (30 words), Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (copy), Lawton and Brodys activities of daily living (ADL) scale test, Barthel Index (BI), HDRS, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were included.\nTo assess the cognitive status of subjects, the scores for each measure of normal-aged patients in Shanghai, China were used as normal baseline (norms). Cognitive dysfunction was defined as -1.5 SD in at least one neuropsychological test. VCIND diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) normal ADL, (2) does not meet criteria for dementia, and (3) mild quantifiable cognitive impairment within one or more domains (i.e., attention, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial function). Functional ability was assessed using BI and Lawtons ADL scales. However, because most patients with cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease had some degree of disability, the study carefully discriminated the part of disability due to cognitive damage and that due to motor sequelae using cognitive impairment history and clinical judgment. Patients were diagnosed as subjects with subcortical vascular disease with no cognitive impairment if scores in all neuropsychological tests were within normal range (less than -1.5 SD).",

    "z-Score calculation": {
      "text": "To allow direct comparison of different tests, z-scores were generated for the neuropsychological measures. A z-score defines where a score falls in the normal distribution of scores; a zscore of 1.0 corresponds to a score 1 SD above the mean score. Direct comparison of performance between tests was possible because z-scores for all tests were based on an identical control population. Raw scores for each of the neuropsychological tests were z-transformed. Thereafter, the z-score of each domain was generated by averaging z-scores of respective tests. Finally, composite z-scores, which stand for general intellect, were computed by averaging the z-scores of individual cognitive domains.\nThe present study focused on using DTI to distinguish VCIND from subjects with subcortical vascular disease with no cognitive impairment (control group). Mean age for VCIND (6 females, 12 males) was 67.07  7.81 years, and the mean education was 10.05  2.27 years. Eighteen subjects with subcortical vascular disease with no cognitive impairment (6 females, 12 males) were selected as controls. Their mean age was 66.22  7.68, while mean education was 11.61  2.93 years.",

For normalization, SPM5 routines (http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspmsoftwarespm5) were applied. First, the b0 image of each subject was normalized to the SPM EPI template. All images were resliced to 3 mm  3 mm  3 mm isotropic voxels, averaged, and then smoothed with a Gaussian Kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). This averaged image was used as template for normalizations. The b0 image of each individual was then normalized to the new template. These individual transformation parameters were subsequently applied to the FA maps of subjects. The structure maps (MPRAGE) of all participants were normalized to the T1 template of SPM5, and the average map was then overlaid on the results.",

      "text": "The diffusion tensor of each voxel was first calculated according to the linear least-square fitting algorithm 9. MD and FA were derived for each voxel 10. Based on normalized mutual information method by using SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK), b0 images of the DTI scans were coregistered with the T1-weighted images. Then the same transformation parameters were used to coregister the MD, FA and FLAIR images. Voxels containing extra-cerebral tissue were removed from the T1-weighted images using a semi-automated technique provided by MRIcro. Then, the corresponding voxels were removed from the MD and FA images. Lesions in the FLAIR sequences of every slice were manually marked, and the same voxels were removed from T1-weighted images using the semiautomated technique provided by MRIcro mentioned before. The margin of lesions was manually delineated in each slice of FLAIR images while avoiding partial volume effect by excluding all abnormal signal intensities and by referring to T1W and T2W images.\nBrain gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF were automatically segmented from T1-weighted images (with and without the lesions) using the segment function of SPM5.Each pixel was classified as GM, WM, or CSF. Therefore, the masks of the WM, normal appearing WM (NAWM) of all subjects were created, the resulting WM, NAWM masks were superimposed onto the MD, FA images. Then the corresponding MD and FA images of the WM, NAWM were created.\nMD and FA histograms (1000 bins) were created from each part of the MD and FA images. Each bin was normalized by the total number of voxels contributing to the histogram to compensate for variability in brain size. The average value, histogram peak height, and histogram peak location of each MD or FA histogram were used to characterize water motion.",

VBA data showed that the VCIND group had lower FA in the WM of their bilateral frontal lobes, occipital lobes, temporal lobes, and insulas compared with the control group. WM of right parietal lobe, brain stem, and corpus callosum were also found to have significantly lower FA values (Table 1). The locations of decreasing FA were widespread throughout the brain (Fig. 1).\nMean FA and MD histograms of WM and NAWM for the two groups are shown in Figs. 2 and3. The histogram-derived measurements of the two groups are shown in Table 2, and correlations between these measurements and the z-scores in the two groups are shown in Table 3. Relative to the control group, the mean FA histograms of NAWM and WM in the VCIND group shifted to the left with a higher peak height, while their mean MD histogram of NAWM and WM shifted to the right with a lower peak height. Further, average FA, mean FA peak location, and mean MD peak height of WM were significantly lower (P  0.001, P  0.002, P  0.006, respectively), whereas average MD and mean MD peak location of WM were significantly higher (P  0.001, P  0.01, respectively). For NAWM, average FA, mean FA peak location, and mean MD peak height were significantly lower (P  0.001, P  0.006, P  0.01, respectively), while mean FA peak height and average MD were significantly higher (P  0.008, P  0.001, respectively).\nIn all participants, z-scores correlated with mean FA peak location, average MD, and mean MD peak location of WM (r  0.437, P  0.008; r  -0.423, P  0.010; r  -0.469, P  0.004, respectively).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "An important consideration in the use of DTI to investigate clinical diseases with dementia is the type of image analysis required. Most prior studies use ROI analysis 11121314, an approach that focuses on a prior hypothesis regarding the location of tissue damage based on clinical and pathological knowledge. ROI analysis is suitable for studies focused on a particular region of the brain, and may provide FA and MD values at a definite location. However, anatomical sites chosen for ROI measurements may not be compre- hensive enough to study disease-related WM changes over diffuse areas of the brain. Further, ROI-based analysis is time-consuming and operator-dependent, and artifacts are related to the shape and size of ROIs used. Furthermore, the use of small-sized ROIs can reduce partial volume effects, while the use of large-sized ROIs can reduce noise 15. In the present study, VBA and histogram analyses were used to reduce some of the problems associated with ROI analysis. VBA and histogram analyses share the capability to examine the whole brain automatically, and are complementary to each other because of their different advantages and drawbacks. A histogram measures global brain damage and might better assess the effect of gluten sensitivity on the brain, whereas voxel-based methods are suitable for evaluation of focal abnormalities. VBA overcomes the operator dependence and the a priori knowledge bias limitations of the region-of-interest approach, while preserving regional information. The main drawback of this method is that it is suitable for analyzing groups of patients and not single subjects. On the other hand, the histogram approach provides an effective graphic representation of the distribution of the parameters under investigation, such as MD or FA. Histogram measurements along with evaluation of the brain reflect not only extent but also severity of damage. The main limitation of histogram analysis is the loss of topographic information, which can be regained if the histogram calculation is preceded by segmentation based on anatomic landmarks. Histograms are used to investigate WM changes in several pathologic conditions, such as multiple sclerosis 16, stroke 17, vascular cognitive impairment 18, and moyamoya disease 19.\nRecent articles about dementia using DTI were focused on Alzheimers disease and mild cognitive impairment 202122 using ROIs and VBA approaches, they suggested both vascular and Alzheimer disease degenerative process contribute to microstructural injury of cerebral white matter across the spectrum of cognitive ability and have different region-specific injury patterns. Subtle brain diffusivity changes occur from the prodromal stages of AD, mainly in posterior brain regions, and spread over the course of the disease to involve the frontal lobe. In MCI, the severity of microstructural damage within and beyond the medial temporal lobe is associated with an increased short-term risk to develop AD. As for VCI, researches suggested DTI histograms may be used as an adjunct outcome measure in future therapeutic trials. Moreover, DTI histogram metrics predict disease progression in Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopahy (CADASIL), a cerebral small vessel disease 23.\nResults of this study showed that VCIND patients have significantly different average MD and average FA histograms of the brain compared with control groups which were in line with our previous study 18. These differences could be attributed to ischemic lesions and subtle changes in NAWM, and suggest a net loss and disorganization of barriers restricting water molecular motion in the brain of patients with VCIND. Compared with the control the average FA histogram of WM and NAWM in the VCIND group shifted to the left with a higher peak height, indicating a decrease in FA value. The average MD histogram of WM and NAWM in the VCIND group shifted to the right with a lower peak height, indicating an increase in molecular water displacement, which is presumably related to the enlargement of extracellular space caused by demyelination and axon loss in VCIND patients. Elevated MD values reflect that cell loss caused by subcortical ischemic vascular disease lead to increased diffusion of water molecules. In contrast, the processes leading to disturbances in WM homogeneity were detected by decreased FA values, which indicate a disturbance of white matter integrity. Correlations between DTI histogramderived parameters and z-scores further supported the concept that the clinical severity of cognitive decline is closely related to the severity of microstructural tissue changes in the brain. SIVD has been shown to be associated with subtle declines in executive function in non-demented patients, with the executive measure correlating with the extent of the lesions but not with the number of lesions 15,24. Interestingly, mean FA was higher while mean MD was lower in WM than in NAWM. This may be explained by two factors. First, the term WM includes all WM in the brain, including both NAWM and lesion areas. The pathology of SIVD includes small lacunae in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or subcortical white matter regions, which can occur in different disease stages, thus producing complicated patterns of changes in FA and MD. Moreover, high signal intensity may reflect a wide spectrum of pathological changes ranging from complete axonal degeneration to relatively benign pathology with preserved fiber architecture 25,26. Second, tested NAWM had some insidious pathological lesions. Recent studies have shown a weak correlation between lesion burden and clinical characteristics, suggesting that changes in NAWM may also contribute to cognitive dysfunctions 8,12,13,23.\nIn summary, VCI is a progressive disease with repeated stroke infarctions in the basal ganglia or diffuse changes in WM 234; hence, DTI histograms can provide quantitative information on the degree of damage in both WM and NAWM, while the value derived from DTI histograms may correlate with clinical measures of cognitive decline 8,25262728. Results of diffusion tensor imaging-based histogram analysis suggest that VCIND patients have more severe damage in WM and NAWM than control group. Further, severity of WM and NAWM damage is related to cognitive dysfunction in VCIND patients. DTI histogram-derived measures may be useful in monitoring the severity of cognitive impairment in VCIND. This study constitutes a preliminary exploration because of the small sample size. To prove clinical value of DTI in patients with VCI, further studies should adopt larger samples with groups of patients with different vascular diseases.",

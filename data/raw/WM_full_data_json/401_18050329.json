    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate microstructural changes in cortical and white matter pathways in patients with Alzheimers disease using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and Methods: Measures of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared in the brains of 13 Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and a group of 13 aged-matched control participants employing an optimized DTI technique involving a fully automated, voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. Results: After rigorous control for anatomical variation and confounding partial volume effects, we found significantly elevated MD measures within the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe gray matter regions in the AD participants. The largest number of pixels with increased MD was localized bilaterally, within the posterior cingulate gyrus. The FA was significantly reduced within the thalamus, parietal white matter, and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, indicating significant involvement of corticothalamic and thalamocortical radiations. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that rigorous VBM analysis of DTI data can be used to investigate microstructural changes in cortical, subcortical, and white matter regions in AD.",

      "text": "A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT is currently being focused towards the development of novel neuroimaging strategies for the improved detection and monitoring of the neuropathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diffusivity indices, in conjunction with structural volumetric MRI measures, show great promise in improving our understanding and quantification of the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) (1)(2)(3)(4). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures the random motion of water in cerebral tissue. When the random motion of water is preferentially restricted to movement in one direction, such as occurs in white matter (WM), diffusion is referred to as being anisotropic. In contrast, water motion in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is equal in all directions and is termed isotropic. The fractional anisotropy (FA), a quantitative measure of the degree of anisotropy, can be used to probe the integrity of brain tissue (5). The mean diffusivity (MD) is a quantitative measure of the mean motion of water considered in all directions and is used to interrogate pathological changes in cerebral tissue, such as ischemia in stroke patients (6). Although the precise neural correlates of altered diffusivity measures are not known with respect to neurodegeneration, increased MD most likely results from loss of neurons, axons, and dendrites. This results in an increase in extracellular space and elevated water diffusivity within these regions (2,7). Reduced FA most likely results from a change in tissue cytoarchitecture due to subtle small vessel alterations, demyelination of axonal structures, and possibly gliosis (7)(8)(9). Changes in axons and oligodendrocytes have been implicated in neuropathological studies of AD (7).\nDiffusion-weighted and DTI-based neuroimaging studies of AD have reported mixed findings regarding altered MD measures in AD. When manual region-ofinterest (ROI) analyses were used, elevated MD measures have been reported within both the left and right hippocampus (1,10) or within the left alone (11); a number of studies have reported no significant difference in MD within the hippocampal formation when comparing AD participants with control subjects (12,13). Diverse findings have also been reported for FA measures in AD. However, studies have generally reported reduced FA within a number of temporal, frontal, and parietal lobe regions, especially within the internal capsule and association fibers of the limbic system (11,14 -22).\nA number of factors may contribute to the variability in these diffusivity findings. These include heterogeneity of the patient group, use of different DTI acquisition schemes, and variation in the anatomical location of ROIs used for analysis of FA indices. One approach to overcome problems associated with the manual placement of ROIs is to interrogate the entire brain using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. This method has been successfully used to investigate WM changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (4,17,19). Medina et al reported significant reduction in FA within the fasciculi of the corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections along with changes in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior cingulate bundle in AD (19). Clearly, the detection of changes in FA within the thalamic radiations would be very difficult using an ROI-based analytical approach.\nThe objective of this study was to expand the use of the VBM analysis technique, incorporating strategies to reduce confounding CSF partial volume effects, to investigate changes in MD and FA measures in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) regions in AD patients compared with a group of aged-matched control participants based on data acquired using an accurate, optimized DTI acquisition strategy (23). Such an approach allows interrogation of the microstructural changes in cortical and subcortical networks in unison with altered connectivity within WM pathways in AD. This strategy may provide new insights into the neuropathological changes associated with AD.",

The local ethics committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained for each subject. Participants were excluded from the study if there was evidence of head trauma, a primary psychiatric diagnosis, infectious or endocrine cause of cognitive dysfunction, a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scor Ͼ 1630, alcohol consumption Ͼ 30 gday in men and 20 gday in women, or a history of habituation to drugs such as benzodiazepines or narcotics. AD subjects were not administered any cognition-enhancing agents during the course of the study. As diffusivity indices would be affected by the presence of cerebrovascular disease (i.e., leukoaraiosis or lacunar infarcts), we were careful to exclude all participants with any visible sign of white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI examination.",

The imaging parameters were 18 axial slices, field of view (FOV) ϭ 24 cm, TRTE 6000 122 msec, 5-mm slice thickness with 1-mm gap, and 56 images acquired at each location consisting of 6 with low diffusion weighting (b ϭ 0) and 50 diffusion images (b ϭ1112 mm 2 s) with a reconstruction matrix of 128 ϫ 128 (23). The MD, a rotationally invariant measure of diffusion equal to one-third of the trace of the diffusion tensor, was used for analysis. FA images were calculated according to the method described by Basser and Jones (6). An isotropically weighted diffusion image (DWI), in which the intensity is a function of the trace of the tensor, was generated for each participant (26). All image analysis was performed off-line using software tools from the Montreal Neurological Institute (www-.bic.mni.mcgill.casoftware).",

      "text": "As all participants in this study had different brain sizes and varying degrees of cortical atrophy, it was imperative that the effects of anatomical variation be minimized to allow accurate voxel-by-voxel statistical comparison between the two subject groups. This was achieved by a rigorous nonlinear registration of all participants diffusion images to the same anatomical space. Conventional MRI studies are based upon the use of T1-weighted threedimensional volumetric scans for registration. In our case we chose to use the T2 images that are acquired as part of the DTI sequence. A number of such T2-weighted images without any diffusion encoding (b ϭ 0 images) are inherently acquired. These b ϭ 0 scans are implicitly in the same raw image space as the generated MD and FA maps and can be used to register individual data into standard anatomical space to allow voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of diffusivity indices between subject groups. Normalization of b ϭ 0 images was achieved by rescaling the pixel intensities between 0 and 100 using two histogram percent critical thresholds. All pixel values outside the lower and upper 0.1 percentile range were assigned values of 0 and 100, respectively.\nParticipants normalized b ϭ 0 images were nonlinearly registered in native space, and an average model for each diffusion index (b ϭ 0, DWI, MD, and FA) was generated. This was achieved in a number of steps. In the first instance all participants normalized b ϭ 0 images were linearly registered to a target image, i.e., a selected b ϭ 0 image from a representative AD subject. An lsq9 (three rotations, three translations, and three scales) linear registration was employed. A linear b ϭ 0 average model was generated from application of these initial transformations. To refine this model, all participants normalized b ϭ 0 images in raw image space were then nonlinearly registered to the linear model in a hierarchical fitting strategy using a step size of 8 mm (27). A new nonlinear b ϭ 0 average model was then generated using these initial nonlinear transformations. This procedure was repeated in an iterative manner using two smaller step sizes of 4 and 2 mm. In each case a new nonlinear model was generated, and partic-ipants b ϭ 0 images in raw image space were nonlinearly registered to the particular nonlinear average model. This procedure provided a mechanism of registering all participants data in native image space.\nTo generate GM, WM, and CSF masks for tissue segmentation, 3000 anatomic priors were manually placed on the diffusion average models to aid classification of tissue type. The anatomical priors, or reference tag points, were placed within known regions of the GM, WM, and CSF on b ϭ 0, FA, and DWI maps, respectively, to allow training of the artificial neural network classifier algorithm classify (28). To take advantage of the contrasting tissue intensities afforded by the three different diffusivity maps, spatial priors corresponding to CSF were placed on DWI maps, and those defining the WM were located on FA maps. GM priors were defined on a b ϭ 0 average model. GM, WM, and CSF tissue masks were then automatically generated using the tissue classifier classify www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca software (28) employing all three diffusion-based average models as input to the classifier.\nAlthough the GM mask represents predominantly parenchymal tissue, to reduce any confounding GM-CSF partial volume effects further, all pixels with an MD Ͼ 1300 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 mm 2 s were removed from this mask. A recent histogram analysis of MD measures has shown that CSF partial volume effects can be reduced by eliminating pixels that lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean MD measure for CSF (29). To reduce possible GM-CSF partial volume effects associated with the WM mask, all pixels with an FA value Ͻ 0.2 were thresholded from this mask. A two-sample t-test was performed to determine significant differences between the two subject groups for both GM and WM regions. Statistical significance on a voxel-by-voxel basis, corrected for multiple comparisons, was determined using Gaussian random field (GRF) theory employing a blurring kernel of 5 mm (fwhm) (30). A t Ͼ 3.45 was considered significant (P Ͻ 0.05) for a cluster-based GRF analysis of 30 pixels or more. ROIs from clusters (Ͼ30 pixels) with a t-value Ͼ 3.45 were automatically extracted from the MD and FA maps.\nTo determine the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space coordinates of anatomical locations with significantly altered diffusivity measure, the final b ϭ 0 nonlinear average model was nonlinearly registered using a hierarchical fitting strategy employing a step size of 2 mm (27) to the MNI T1 template known as the ICBM152 (31), and the resulting deformation field was applied to the other statistical maps. As the VBM-based approach relies on the diffusivity measures being normally distributed, we checked this assumption by analyzing MD and FA indices within anatomical locations with significantly altered diffusivity measures using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.",

    "RESULTS": {
      "text": "For the groups of AD and elderly control participants, there was no significant difference in age, gender ratio, education level, or extent of depressive symptoms (GDS scores). As expected, neuropsychological tests revealed significant differences in cognitive function (MMSE) be-tween the groups. Representative images of the three average models (b ϭ 0, MD, and FA) along with GM, WM, and CSF segmentation masks for the b ϭ 0 model are given in Fig. 1. After controlling for the majority of atrophic and anatomical variation by nonlinearly registering each control and AD subjects images to an average space, we found no statistically significant differences on the normalized T2-weighted MRI (b ϭ 0) between the two groups, indicating a high level of spatial registration.\nCompared with control subjects, we found a number of GM cortical regions within the AD group with significantly increased measures of MD. The coordinates and mean MD measures for each group are given in Table 1. Elevated MD measures were found within medial temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe regions, namely, the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate gyrus. Anatomical regions with significantly elevated MD, overlaid on the T1-weighted ICBM152 average model, are shown in Fig. 2. There were no GM pixels with reduced MD nor WM pixels with increased MD. In addition, regions of significantly elevated MD overlaid on standard deviation maps derived from the nonlinear b ϭ 0 average model at the level of the cingulate gyrus are given in Fig. 3. These maps highlight the fact that cortical regions with elevated MD correspond to locations with reduced anatomical variability, indicating minimal contribution from CSF partial volume effects. The relationship between MD threshold levels for reducing CSF partial volume effects within the GM mask is shown in Fig. 4.\nWith respect to anisotropy measures, for GM we found significantly decreased FA within the AD group in the thalamus compared with control participants. For WM, we found significantly reduced measures within the parietal white matter and posterior limbs of the internal capsule at the level of the corticothalamic and thalamocortical radiations (Fig. 5). The stereotaxic coordinates and mean FA measures for the AD and elderly control groups for both GM and WM regions are given in Table 2. There were no GM or WM regions with significantly elevated FA measures between the groups.\nThe results for the KS test for normality of data for three representative anatomical locations with significantly altered diffusivity measure, namely, the posterior cingulate (MD), thalamus, and posterior limbs of the internal capsule (FA) are given in Tables 1 and2.\nFor all pixels within these anatomical regions the diffusivity measures were found to be normally distributed.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Although the concept of investigating the integrity of white matter in MCI and AD using VBM techniques has been previously reported (4,17,19), in this study we have expanded these approaches to include the use of population-specific averages to investigate MD and FA changes in both gray and white matter structures. After controlling for variations in brain size due to atrophy, we found significantly elevated MD in brain regions known to be af- 33) a Units ϫ 10 Ϫ6 mm 2 s. b Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS) found that the MD measures within the left and right posterior cingulate were normally distributed and that the difference between MD measures between the control and AD subjects was significant, D 0.6923, P ϭ 0.002. fected in AD. The MD was significantly elevated in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal gyri, temporal gyri, medial frontal gyri, and posterior cingulate gyrus in the AD participants compared with the agedmatched control subjects. The largest numbers of voxels with increased MD were located within the posterior cingulate gyrus, bilaterally. Many of these anatomical regions have been previously reported to exhibit decreased gray matter density, derived using VBM analyses of T1weighted structural images (32)(33)(34).\nElevated measures of MD localized to the entorhinal cortex in amnestic MCI subjects has been previously reported using VBM-based analyses (4). Given this finding, our study suggests the presence of a pattern of increased MD measures expanding into other regions of the hippocampal formation in AD, namely, the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. Importantly, these new findings support previous reports of elevated MD measures within the hippocampus in AD using ROIbased analytical methods (1,11). The involvement of many other temporoparietal and frontal lobe structures, including the cingulate gyrus, gives evidence of a spreading pattern of altered cortical cytoarchitecture in AD. Although the precise neural correlates of elevated MD are unknown, the link between the brain regions with elevated MD and reduced GM density in AD (2,3) indicates that MD measures may be sensitive to AD neuropathology and, when used conjointly with structural MRI, may provide an additional strategy for monitoring the progression of AD.\nIn the WM, microstructural changes within the posterior limbs of the internal capsule were found in the AD participants compared with control subjects. As studies have shown preservation of WM corticospinal tracts that project into motor regions (14,20), we believe that these WM tracts with reduced FA most likely involve corticothalamic and thalamocortical radiations rather than pyramidal tract pathways. Reduced FA within thalamic radiations has been previously reported in AD patients (19); furthermore, care was taken to exclude any subject with cerebrovascular disease evident on T2-weighted MRI examination that might confound FA measures in the deep WM.\nIn this study we have shown for the first time reduced FA measures located within the thalamus. Interestingly, reduced GM density has also been reported to occur within thalamic structures in AD using VBM analysis of structural MRI data (32,34). In our study, the change in cytoarchitecture within the thalamus measured using FA also gives further evidence of possible involvement of perturbed corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in AD. Based on MRI structural and metabolic measures using fluodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, it was recently postulated that episodic memory impairment in AD could not be totally explained by neuronal damage to the medial temporal lobe alone, but most likely involved dysfunction of an integrated network involving the medial temporal lobe, thalamus, and posterior cingulate (35). Furthermore, within this network it was suggested that the posterior cingulate, which was found to be the most significantly hypometabolic cortical region, may be of greatest importance in generating this cognitive deficit (35). Our novel findings of reduced MD within hippocampal and medial temporal structures with increased involvement of the posterior cingulate in conjugation with reduced anisotropy measures within the thalamus and corticothalamic and thalamocortical WM pathways give strong evidence to support this concept regarding episodic memory impairment in AD.\nIn contrast to many other studies, the DTI-based findings in this study were derived using fully automated postprocessing and analytical methods. The potential problems associated with automated VBM analyses of DTI data have been recently outlined (36). These include accuracy of registration of diffusivity data, the use of standard space templates such as the ICBM152 for registration and tissue segmentation, and the application of smoothing kernels prior to statistical analysis of grouped data. In this study, we have attempted to address many of these issues. When interrogating MD changes in GM, nonoptimized image registration associated with anatomical variation and geometric distor- tion of diffusion images may result in elevated MD measures within the AD group due to CSF inclusion within various anatomical locations. To reduce potential sources of error of this nature, we employed a number of image processing steps. These included careful registration of all diffusion images to the same image space, segmentation of images using GM, WM, and CSF masks derived from the actual patient data, and subsequent thresholding of GM and WM masks to reduce partial volume effects further prior to VBM analysis.\nTo test the accuracy of our registration procedure, we evaluated the null hypothesis, i.e., whether there were any significant statistical differences between the normalized anatomical T2-weighted (b ϭ 0) images between the two subject groups. As this test revealed no significant statistical difference between the two groups for any brain region, we believe that altered measures of diffusivity detected in this study are due to microstructural changes in brain tissue and not indirect measures of regional brain atrophy due to registration error.\nAlthough for VBM analyses it is possible to normalize DTI data spatially to a standard template such as the T1-or T2-weighted ICBM152 template prior to segmentation based on the use of probabilistic WM masks (19), we carefully registered all data within the same native image space to reduce potential error associated with this registration step (36,37). Such use of a populationspecific average allows segmentation of diffusion images using the actual AD and elderly control data and not probabilistic masks derived from a non-agedmatched subject group. In this study, we also investigated the effect of additional thresholding of the GM mask to reduce CSF partial volume effects further.\nFigure 4 shows the effect of thresholding the GM mask at different MD levels on the number of pixels within the posterior cingulate with significantly elevated MD measures. The number of pixels with significantly elevated MD measure remains constant until an MD level of approximately 1600 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 mm 2 s, at which value the number of significant pixels is dramatically decreased. As a recent histogram analysis of MD measures has shown that CSF partial volume effects can be reduced by eliminating pixels that lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean MD measure for CSF (29), we selected a more ro-bust threshold value of 1300 ϫ 10 Ϫ6 mm 2 s so as to remove as many pixels as possible with some degree of CSF partial volume involvement and yet retain those with increased MD due to AD neuropathology. At this threshold level many of the cortical and subcortical regions with significantly elevated MD corresponded to very similar regions with reduced GM density (32). However, using this MD threshold value eliminated many of the pixels with elevated MD at the very cortical surface where one would expect more CSF partial volume effect.\nThis point is highlighted during investigation of the spatial relationship between cortical regions with significantly elevated MD measure and the b ϭ 0 nonlinear average model standard deviation maps. As shown in Fig. 3, significant cortical and ventricular variation exists even after careful registration of participants b ϭ 0 images. However, regions with significantly elevated MD were found to be localized primarily in locations of low anatomical variability, indicating minimal CSF partial volume effects. Detection of more widespread microstructural changes within the cortex in AD participants may be possible with higher resolution DTI data. To reduce possible GM-CSF partial volume effects associated with the WM mask, in this study all pixels with an FA value Ͻ 0.2 were also thresholded from this mask.\nIt should be noted that voxel-based morphological analyses of FA data can be affected by the size of the smoothing kernel used in the analysis (38). In our subject cohort, changing the size of the smoothing kernel (3-10 mm) or cluster size used in the GRF analysis had limited effect on the anatomical locations with significantly elevated MD or reduced FA measures. Analysis of MD measures using VBM techniques are less sensitive to filter size because the data are more normally distributed (38,39). However, to test whether the MD within the posterior cingulate and FA measure within the thalamus and posterior limbs of the internal capsule were normally distributed, we analyzed the diffusivity indices within these regions using a KS test. As shown in Tables 1 and2, the nonparametric KS analysis demonstrated that the MD and FA measures were normally distributed and that there was a significant difference between the diffusivity indices between the control and AD subjects for these regions. (KS) found that the FA measures within the left and right thalamus and white matter tracts were normally distributed and that the differences between FA measures between the control and AD subjects were significant at D 0.69, P ϭ 0.002 and D 0.85, P ϭ 0.001, respectively.\nThere are three main limitations to this current study: the modest number of subjects, uncertainty regarding the precise tissue correlates of altered diffusivity measures in AD, and the resolution of the DTI data. However, using a rigorous VBM approach we have shown significantly elevated measures of MD in AD subjects compared with age-matched control participants, indicating a pattern of altered cytoarchitectural cortical changes. Cortical areas with increased MD correlate with regions of known AD neuropathology and reduced gray matter density measured using structural MRI. Whether this pattern is specific for AD participants with minimal evidence of cerebrovascular disease in the deep WM requires much larger DTI-based dementia studies. This study has highlighted the additional information that can be obtained using VBM analytical approaches for investigating altered cortical and subcortical networks and WM neural pathways associated with AD neuropathology.",

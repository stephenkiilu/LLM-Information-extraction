    "Introduction": {
      "text": "While physiological changes in white matter (WM) microstructural integrity can be observed in healthy aging, neurodegeneration due to Alzheimers disease (AD) 1 and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) 2 are characterized by accelerated myelin disruption and axonal damage and loss. Both AD and cSVD affect oligodendrocyte function, acting through iron overload, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction pathways, ultimately resulting in demyelination and axonal loss. 3,4 Previous studies have investigated the interplay between AD and cSVD on white matter microstructural integrity, observing variable degrees of association when looking at different imaging biomarkers of cSVD, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), 5 and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). 6 Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding their possible interactive effects on neurodegeneration and white matter disruption, with studies supporting both a synergistic effect 7 and the independence 8 of AD from cSVD and cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, it is still unclear whether these associations are related to shared risk factors or to the mechanistic interplay between the underlying pathological alterations.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique sensitive to white matter (WM) microstructural changes. 9 By measuring the diffusion properties of water molecules, it is possible to assess metrics of WM integrity such as fractional anisotropy (FAthe fraction of diffusion along one preferential direction) and mean diffusivity (MD -the average of diffusion along three main axes). 10 Decrease in FA and increase in MD have been observed from the early stages of neurodegeneration due to both AD 1 and cSVD, 2 highlighting the potential of DTI metrics as early and non-invasive imaging biomarkers. Previous studies suggest that the susceptibility to WM alterations could present disease-specific spatial patterns. In particular, while the amyloid-b (Ab) pathological cascade of events has mostly been associated with reduction of temporal and parietal WM integrity, 11 cSVD typically relates to alterations at the level of the genu of corpus callosum (CC), 12 suggesting that these diseases could exert differential regional effects. However, although it has been shown that these pathologies often coexist, 3 whether and to what extent they interact with each other in determining WM microstructural disruption remains unclear.\nThe development of new targeted therapies for AD and cSVD 13,14 highlights the need for identifying the determinants of WM alterations and disentangling their individual contributions. 15 In recent years, intervention studies have been progressively focusing on the preclinical and prodromal stages of dementia, using mixed strategies to target the risk factors associated with AD 13 and cSVD. 16 As new primary and secondary prevention trials are starting, we need robust and possibly noninvasive biomarkers to properly define the enrollment criteria and serve as outcome measures of treatment efficacy in absence of cognitive decline. 13 This study aims to explore the differential impact and possible interactions of AD pathology and cSVD, along with their associated genetic (APOE-e4) and acquired (cardiovascular) risk factors, on WM microstructural alterations as assessed by DTI in a large sample of non-demented older adults from the European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia (EPAD) cohort.",

We created a FA skeleton mask that comprised the WM regions common to the group. Using the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 atlas, 24 FA and MD were extracted from 14 selected skeletonized tracts (Fig. 2), subdivided in commissural, associative, limbic (to distinguish them from other associative and commissural tracts, based on their involvement in AD pathophysiology) 25 and projections tracts. DTI scalars were site-harmonized using the Com-Bat Toolbox 26 and standardized. More details are given in supplementary material. We decided to not mask out WMHs from skeletonized tracts because we were interested in the effect of our putative determinants on the total WM, though their impact was negligible as the percentage of WMH voxels included in the skeletonized tracts was very low on average (1.5 AE 2.9).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We investigated the effect of AD biomarkers, cSVD burden, and cardiovascular risk factors on WM microstructural integrity in non-demented older adults in the multi-center EPAD cohort. AD pathology (Ab 1-42 and p-Tau 181 ) and APOE-e4 had prominent effects on limbic tracts, while cSVD and FRS mostly impacted commissural, associative, and projection tracts. We showed that AD biomarkers and cSVD are independently associated with WM disruption in the explored tracts.\nWM microstructural integrity of limbic tracts such as fornix (column body) and cingulum was found to be mostly impacted by AD biomarkers and APOE-e4. This is in line with previous studies highlighting the involvement of these tracts, starting from AD preclinical stages, 27,28 as key structures of the Papez circuit, responsible for episodic memory functioning. 25 Indeed, diffusivity alterations of these tracts have been shown to predict tau accumulation in amyloid-positive individuals. 29 The strongest association was between AT-status and fornix (column body) integrity, suggesting an early role of this structure. Similarly, decreases in fornix FA were previously shown to predict conversion from preserved cognition toward mild cognitive impairment and dementia, 27 further supporting its role in disease progression. The lack of association between AT status and fornix microstructure could be due to the relatively low number of AT participants. Nevertheless, evidence suggests a biphasic relationship between AD pathology and DTI scalars, as the inflammatory mechanisms linked to amyloid and tau accumulation (i.e., glial activation and cellular swelling) may cause changes opposing the typical neurodegeneration pattern. 1,30 We observed widespread changes in white matter integrity in commissural, associative, and projection fibers, and demonstrated the presence of disease-specific gradients of WM disruption, anterior regions being more susceptible to vascular compromise and posterior regions to AD-related factors. Specifically, WM integrity in the genu (anterior part) of CC was distinctively associated with cSVD and FRS, while both AD pathology and cSVD had a significant effect on body and splenium (middle and posterior parts). Moreover, while the posterior limb of the internal capsule was mainly impacted by AD-related factors, alterations of the anterior limb were more often observed in individuals with high cerebrovascular burden. This posterior-anterior gradient of WM deterioration is in line with the evidence of frontal WM being more sensitive to vascular health, and generally more susceptible to cerebrovascular insults. 31 Previous work has shown that global vascular health has a significant impact on white matter integrity, more strongly in the genu of the corpus callosum, 32 and several studies have shown the detrimental effect of single cardiovascular risk factors on commissural WM tracts, such as hypertension 33 and diabetes, 34 suggesting that this region is a proxy for cerebrovascular health. 32 Moreover, anterior patterns of WMHs have been shown to distinctively relate to cardiovascular etiologies. 35 Conversely, WM lesions in parietal and occipital regions have been observed in association with amyloid pathology, independently of cardiovascular risk factors. 11 In line with our results, previous studies have shown amyloid pathology in relationship with alterations in a group of regions including medial, temporal, and posterior white matter. 36 The specific mechanisms through which amyloid deposition could impact white matter integrity are still unclear. On one hand, previous evidence has shown spatial correspondence between cortical amyloid deposition and white matter demyelination, possibly due to local alteration of neuronal and axonal function, thereby regulating oligodendrocyte functions, or resulting from Ab-induced oxidative stress. 37 Conversely, Ab deposition may enhance capillary cortical amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and arteriosclerosis, 38 resulting in hypoperfusion, 39 which may eventually lead to white matter damage through secondary vascular events. 37 Given that AD pathology and cSVD often coexist from early stages of neurodegeneration, 40 questions have arisen regarding their impact on brain structure, 12,41,42 raising the need to determine whether they act separately or jointly in causing WM disruption. 15 Specifically, a recent ex vivo study has shown that the accumulation of WMHs is related to cSVD independently of AD pathology in non-demented older adults. 41 A fixel-based study has demonstrated that cSVD mainly impacts fiber density, while AD pathology has comparable effects on fiber density and cross-section, 42 leaving the question on their interaction unanswered. Here, we showed that they are both related to various degrees of disruption depending on the affected tracts, but seem to act largely independently. Only APOE-e4 (independently of Ab 1-42 and p-Tau 181 , both accounted for in the linear mixedeffects models) 43 showed interactions with FRS and cSVD in limbic and associative tracts. APOE-e4 is involved in many amyloid-independent pathways affecting synaptic plasticity, metabolism, and vascular homeostasis, 44 and therefore possibly synergizing with other cSVD-specific inherited and acquired risk factors. 45 In this light, our results suggest that although sharing common etiopathological mechanisms, AD pathology and cSVD exert independent effects on white matter microstructure in preclinical stages. They also provide context for the selection of DTI metrics as outcome measures in primary and secondary prevention clinical trials, possibly representing a noninvasive alternative to PET imaging and a more sensitive MRI biomarker compared to hippocampal atrophy. 46 In particular, our findings indicate that limbic tracts would be most relevant for therapeutic strategies targeting the AT pathway, whereas commissural, associative, or projection tracts might be better choices for interventions targeting cerebrovascular mechanisms.\nIn line with previous evidence, 47 lower integrity measures were associated with higher age and male sex, with men showing higher MD in most of the tracts. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, FA increased over time, possibly resulting from the relative sparing of the sensorimotor pathway in a crossing fibers region. 48 Similarly, in the anterior limb of internal capsule FA increased, due to the faster degradation of genu of CC fibers. 49 Some tracts showed a longitudinal MD decrease, supposedly due to the neuroinflammatory changes characterizing age-related neurodegeneration that may precede or overlap with microstructural disruption, causing temporary MD increases. 50 We were able to identify a greater number of significant longitudinal effects on MD compared to FA, supporting the evidence of MD being more sensitive than FA. 51 Our study relies on a relatively large sample size and on the advantage of longitudinal data, but has also some limitations. Firstly, we used an atlas-based approach. As DTI tractography yields subject-specific masks and connectomes, further studies are warranted to confirm and expand our results. Using a simpler and robust approach, we showed that TBSS is sensitive to AD and cSVD associated factors. Considering its less demanding computational time and power compared to connectome analysis, TBSS application to large datasets and in the context of clinical trials is favored. Secondly, since our acquisition protocol comprised 30 diffusion directions only, we were limited to classical tensor-based analyses, with the limitation of being unable to resolve crossing fibers. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm our findings, and possibly expand on them by exploring other DTI scalars, which we did not include to reduce the number of tests and increase our power to identify biological effects. Another limitation is the multicentric nature of the study, representing a confounding factor that could not be entirely removed using state-of-art harmonization methods. Nonetheless, this also implies the effects that we found must be robust as we were still able to observe them. Importantly, while our results provide information on the biological mechanisms underlying myelin disruption in healthy aging and disease, further studies are needed to translate our group findings to single subjects, which still represents one of the most demanding and still unsolved challenges of the entire field. While we decided to dichotomize Ab1-42 and p-Tau181 to adhere to the biological definition of AD and to the ATN framework, and subsequently we used gaussian mixture modeling to identify a cut-off to dichotomize cSVD and make it comparable to the ATN classification, further studies could explore the relationship between WM integrity and continuous measure of amyloid and tau accumulation or cSVD burden. Lastly, further research is needed to model the nonlinear relationship between amyloid and WM integrity. 1,30 In conclusion, we showed that AD pathology and cSVD are independently associated with myelin microstructural integrity within several tracts, with pathology-specific spatial patterns of WM vulnerability. This evidence supports the role of DTI for disease monitoring and subjects selection for early intervention targeting the factors associated with increased risk of developing dementia.",

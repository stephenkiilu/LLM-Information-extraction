    "abstract": "Introduction The objective of the study was to explore the impact of the background gradients on diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively normal (CN) aging. Methods Two DT-MRI sets with positive and negative polarities of the diffusion-sensitizing gradients were obtained in 15 AD patients, 18 MCI patients, and 16 CN control subjects. The maps of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were computed separately for positive (p: pMD and pFA) and negative (n: nMD and nFA) polarities, and we computed the geometric mean (gm) of the DT-MRI to obtain the gmFA and gmMD with reducing the background gradient effects. Regional variations were assessed across the groups using one-way analysis of variance. Results Increased regional gmMD values in the AD subjects, as compared to the regional gmMD values in the MCI and CN subjects, were found primarily in the frontal, limbic, and temporal lobe regions. We also found increased nMD and pMD values in the AD subjects compared to those values in the MCI and CN subjects, including in the temporal lobe and the left limbic parahippocampal gyrus white matter. Results of comparisons among the three methods showed that the left limbic parahippocampal gyrus and right temporal gyrus were the increased MD in the AD patients for all three methods. Conclusion Background gradients affect the DT-MRI measurements in AD patients. Geometric average diffusion measures can be useful to minimize the intrinsic local magnetic susceptibility variations in brain tissue.",

      "text": "Diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) is sensitive to the directionality of the random motion of water in tissue, and it involves the application of external diffusion-sensitizing magnetic field gradients along different orientations to quantify the properties of diffusion.\nNumerous DT-MRI studies of neurodegenerative diseases have reported abnormal diffusion values in the brain, including Alzheimers disease (AD), which is a devastating condition that leads to progressive memory loss and rapid cognitive decline. Although AD is generally considered to affect primarily the gray matter, several studies have found changes of the isotropic and anisotropic diffusion in white matter associated with AD progression by using DT-MRI 123456. The diffusion abnormalities in AD were predominantly found in the posterior regions of the brain such as the hippocampal gyrus, the temporal white matter, the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the posterior cingulum. In patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is considered to represent a transitional stage between normal aging and AD, the changes seem to parallel those in AD with similar posterior regions showing abnormalities. In contrast to AD and MCI, the diffusion abnormalities in subjects with age-associated changes (cognitively normal, CN) occur in the frontal regions, and specifically in the frontal white matter, the anterior cingulum, and the genu of the corpus callosum 7.\nAlthough the marked differences seen on DT-MRI between AD or MCI and normal aging have been considered as potential imaging markers 8910, the underlying mechanism of the DT-MRI changes remains largely unexplained. In particular, the local variations in cell density, oligodentrocytes, myelination, and also amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of AD 111213, can be the source of local magnetic susceptibility variations, which in turn can alter water diffusion. Furthermore, it has been shown in rat brain 14 that brain iron, which occurs in high concentrations in oligodentrocytes and plaques 151617, can modulate the diffusion measurements. These finding suggests that local magnetic susceptibility variations in brain tissue may contribute to the DT-MRI abnormalities seen in AD and MCI in the form of intrinsic susceptibilitydependent background gradients that add to the external diffusion weighting gradients. The previous DT-MRI studies did not take into account the local variations in brain.\nAll investigators may be interested in knowing where in the brain and for which patients these different diffusion effects are with and without considering the background gradients. So, the overall goal of this study was to investigate whether intrinsic background gradients contribute to the pattern of regional diffusion abnormalities in patients with AD, MCI, and CN, and this potentially reflects the underlying pathological processes associated with brain iron. Specifically, we hypothesized that AD patients show a systematic pattern of higher regional background gradients compared to the MCI and CN subjects.",

      "text": "The DT-MRI measurements were performed using a singleshot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with inversionprepared magnetization to suppress the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 21. CSF suppression was used to reduce errors in the diffusion measurements from the partial volume effects in the voxels that represent CSF. A double refocusing spinecho acquisition with bipolar external diffusion gradients 22 was employed to minimize the artifacts due to eddy currents. Six diffusion encoding directions 23 and five diffusion sensitivities (b values 0, 160, 360, 640, and 1,000 smm 2 ) were acquired to determine the apparent diffusion coefficients and the diffusion tensor for each voxel. Furthermore, two DT-MRI datasets were acquired with alternating polarities of the external diffusionsensitizing gradients (positive G d and negative -G d ) to investigate the effects of background gradients on the DT-MRI measures of the patients with AD. The other imaging parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)echo time (TE)inversion time (TI)5,0001003,000 ms with 2.4 2.4 mm 2 in-plane resolution and 19 slices of 5-mm slice thickness without a gap, which covered approximately 80 of the brain.\nIn addition to the DT-MRI scan, the sagittal structural volumetric T 1 -weighted (T1W) images were acquired as follows: TRTETI 104300 ms, flip angle 15and spatialresolution ¼ 1 Â 1 Â 1:5 mm resolution. The intermediate (or proton density)-weighted (PD) and T 2 -weighted (T2W) axial images were also acquired using a multislice double spin-echo (DSE) sequence. The imaging parameters for DSE were as follows: TRTE 1 5,0002080 ms with 1.251 mm in-plane resolution and a 3-mm thickness, and contiguous slices covering the entire brain. The structural images allowed registration between the structural data and the DT-MRI data and spatial normalization of the DT-MRI indices into a reference space (vide infra). In addition, a T 2weighted spin-echo EPI image (referred to below as a reference EPI image) was acquired at the same resolution and orientation as the diffusion scans, but with whole brain coverage and without inversion preparation to improve registering the DT-MRI data to the structural images. Acquisition of the reference EPI was necessary because the DT-MRI slices did not cover the whole brain and the EPI data without diffusion gradients (EPI at b0 smm 2 ) had limited structural information because of the inversion pulse.",

The MD and FA maps (pMD and pFA) were calculated by using only the positive polarity of the diffusion-encoding gradients, and these maps (nMD and nFA) were also calculated by using only the negative polarity of the diffusion-encoding gradients separately without taking into account a background gradient effect. In addition, the maps of the geometric means of MD and FA (gmMD and gmFA) were calculated to minimize the unknown cross-term effects of the background and the diffusion-encoding gradients. The geometric means of FA and MD were calculated by taking the inner product of the diffusion-encoding gradients with positive and negative polarities according to ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi S p  S n p , where S p and S n are the diffusion-weighted signals acquired with the positive (p) and negative (n) gradient polarities, respectively 18,19.

This assumption is reasonable because first, both datasets are subjected to similar geometrical distortions; second, additional distortions due to the eddy currents induced by the diffusion-encoding gradients are minimal since we used a double refocusing sequence; and third, the datasets were acquired in an interleaved fashion to reduce movement effects between the frames. The DT_b0 EPI data (TE100 ms and inversion-prepared and 19 slices) were coregistered to the reference EPI data (TE 100 ms without inversion, but with whole brain coverage) using an affine transformation available with Statistical Parameter Mapping software (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, England, UK). The reference EPI data were then further coregistered to the T2W images, which were in turn coregistered to the PD images (acquired together with the T2W using double spin-echo acquisition). Finally, the PD images, and thus the DT_b0 EPI data and the maps of the DT-MRI data were coregistered to the 3D T1W images.

In this analysis, we want to know where in the brain and for which patients were the gmMDs different from either the nMD or pMD.

Based on the results of the tests, we obtained common areas of the three MDs that were nMD, pMD, and gmMD to evaluate the advantages of the geometrical mean operation.\nIn addition to the voxel-based analyses, we also analyzed the data with defining a region-of-interest (ROI).

As expected, the MMSE scores were significantly lower for the AD patients as compared to those of the other groups (p0.05), but the MMSE scores did not significantly differ between the MCI and CN subjects (p0.05).\nFigure 1 shows the results of the voxel-wise comparisons of the pMD, nMD, and gmMD maps between the AD and MCI groups (Fig. 1a) and between the AD and CN groups (Fig. 1b) based on one-way ANOVA tests. Compared to the MCI patients, the AD patients had increased pMD values mainly in the temporal and frontal lobes. The AD patients also had increased nMD values (AD  MCI) mainly in the temporal lobe. Moreover, we found that the AD patients had increased gmMD values (AD  MCI) predominantly in the right superior temporal gyrus, the left limbic parahippocampal gyrus white matter, and the left superior and medial frontal gyrus. There were no significantly decreased MD values in the gmMD, pMD, and nMD maps from the patients with AD as compared with that of the MCI subjects. The detailed results are summarized in Table 2.\nCompared to the CN subjects, the AD patients had increased pMD values mainly in the temporal gyrus. The AD patients also had increased nMD values (AD  CN) mainly in the temporal gyrus. Moreover, we found that the AD patients had increased gmMD values (AD  CN, Fig. 1b) predominantly in the left limbic parahippocampal gyrus, the left limbic uncus, the left and right temporal subgyrus, and the right middle temporal gyrus. These detailed results are summarized in Table 3.\nFigure 2 shows the differences in the pFA maps between the MCI or CN and AD subjects. Compared to the MCI patients, the AD patients had increased pFA values (AD  MCI) mainly in the temporal and frontal gyrus and the posterior cingulate. The detailed results are also summarized in Table 4. Compared to the CN subjects, the AD patients also had increased pFA values (AD  CN) mainly in the left inferior and superior frontal gyrus. We did not find any significant differences in the pFA between the MCI and CN subjects. Similarly, we did not find any significant differences in the gmFA or nFA across the three groups. The results of the FA are summarized in Table 5.\nThe significant regions that overlap in all three DT-MRI sets (positive gradients, negative gradients, and geometric mean) as well as those regions that differ are listed in Table 6 for the MD (pMD, nMD, and gmMD) and in Table 7 for the FA measures. The overlapping regions of increased MD in the AD patients relative to the MCI subjects (AD  MCI) included the right superior temporal gyrus and left limbic parahippocampal gyrus.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "A new finding of this study is that in AD patients, the background gradients have a significantly greater effect on the MD than that in the MCI or CN subjects. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that the elevated iron-rich processes in AD patients, such as the accumulation of amyloid plaques, induce local variations in magnetic susceptibility, and these are detectable as regional changes in the background gradients. This finding suggests that the contributions to the background gradients are heterogeneous. Finally, our results from the regular DT-MRI maps using diffusion-sensitizing gradients with positive polarity alone are consistent with the results of the previous DT-MRI studies on AD, MCI, and CN subjects. AD was associated with a systematic pattern of diffusion alternations in the MD maps relative to MCI and CN even when the geometrical mean values of diffusivity (gmMD) were computed, which should in principle lead to diminished effects of the background gradients. The increased gmMD values in the AD subjects were found in the region of the right superior temporal gyrus. A previous DT-MRI study that used single polarity diffusion-encoding gradients reported elevated MD values in the AD subjects relative to that in the MCI subjects in the same region 5. In addition, we also found increased gmMD values in the AD subjects in the left superior frontal gyrus gray matter and left medial frontal gyrus white matter. Furthermore, compared to the CN subjects, we found increased gmMD values in the AD subjects in the limbic parahippocampal and right middle temporal gyrus, and the left and right temporal white matter. Those areas were also consistent with those of the previous single polarity DT-MRI studies in AD patients 1,3,4,27. Furthermore, we found increased gmMD values in the AD subjects involving the left limbic uncus gray matter, and this region has not been reported before in DT-MRI studies. The findings are consistent with our results of comparing the MD maps derived from Table 4 The significantly different regions when comparing between the AD and MCI groups (AD  MCI) using the FA maps with (gmFA) and without (nFA and pFA) minimizing the effects of the background gradients (corrected FDR (p0.01) as a cluster level; one-way ANOVA tests) the diffusion-sensitizing gradients with different polarity, and the findings further support our hypothesis that intrinsic susceptibility variations of the brain contribute to the regional diffusion abnormalities in AD patients. One of our findings was that the regional distribution of elevated gmMD values in the AD patients did not completely overlap with the corresponding pattern of nMD and pMD variations in the AD patients. The regional difference could reflect the heterogeneity of AD pathology or different stages of the disease, as well as the variations in the processes leading to local variations in magnetic susceptibility. For example, the regions where all three diffusion measurements (pMD, nMD, and gmMD) show significant alterations might be related to alterations primarily in the cell density that alter the MD, but they do not substantially alter the magnet susceptibility. On the other hand, the regions without a significant change in the gmMD, but that are with significant changes in the nMD and pMD, could mainly reflect the characteristic local magnetic susceptibility variations related to the paramagnetic effects from iron-rich processes involving the oligodentrocytes and amyloid plaques. The sensitivity differences between in the various MD maps cannot explain the regional discordance between the changes in the pMD and nMD. We cannot directly compare the sensitivity difference between the gmMD maps and the pMD or nMD maps because the gmMD map is derived by averaging two DT-MRI signals and generally has a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the individual pMD and nMD, which are based on a single DT-MRI signal. Therefore, the geometrically calculated MD (gmMD) in the AD or MCI patients may be better to differentiate accurately between the groups as compared to that obtained with the single polarity.\nWe tested our concepts in water phantom before we applied in human brain. The mean ADC value or average tensor components or mean eigenvalue is different about 0.00004 mm 2 s, and the FA value is different about 0.00188 between the positive and negative diffusion gradients. This means that our human results should be clearly shown reliable measurements of DTI data without absence of any 2 and3 for the mean diffusivity (MD) systematic bias due to the different gradient settings (positive vs negative).\nIn voxel-wise comparisons of human brain data, the results from geometric mean appear highly similar to those from negative gradients, while positive gradients show very different results. We may explain the reason as the following. The largest contribution of cross terms tends to be when the applied diffusion gradient and the intrinsic background magnetic field gradient are in the same direction and sign as the frequency-encoding direction. With the used TE value, this would mean that we would get more positive pixels for positive diffusion and read gradients than for negative diffusion and positive read gradients. This is supported by getting comparable diffusion rates for all gradient directions on an isotropic phantom experiment with the same acquisition parameters.\nOur DTI findings using diffusion-sensitizing gradients with the single positive polarity are largely consistent with the findings of the previous DT-MRI studies that used a single gradient polarity 1,34527. Specifically, our finding in AD patients of increased pMD values in the right middle temporal gyrus white matter and the left superior temporal gyrus white matter, as compared to that of the MCI patients, are consistent with a previous report The ROIs are listed in the table above. The significant level was used with p0.016 (p0.053 times repeated) because we repeated the same tasks three times among the three groups 5. Similarly, our results in AD patients of increased pMD values in the limbic parahippocampal gyrus white matter, the right temporal gyrus white matter, and the right occipital white matter are consistent with the results of the previous studies 1,3,4,27. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the background gradient effects in DT-MRI can be amplified due to an interaction (also known as the cross-term effect) between the external and background gradients. Several diffusion studies have reported significant cross-term effects on the measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) in phantoms 28, rat brain 14, and pig spinal cord 29. Indeed, several studies have shown that cross-term effects can also depend, at least in part, on the types of sequence and the external gradient patterns 30,31, and these effects can in principle be minimized by the combined use of a multispin-echo preparation and pulse gradients for diffusion encoding 32 or the combined use of asymmetric bipolar diffusion-encoding gradients and twice refocused spin-echo preparation 22. A further class of experimental strategies that also accounts for the presence of field inhomogeneities is based on the use of bipolar gradient pluses 22,33,34. However, some ADC studies have found no detectable cross-term effects 35, The ROIs are listed in the table above. The significant level was used with p0.016 (p0.053 times repeated) because we repeated the same tasks three times among the three groups including a DT-MRI study in normal young human brain 36. Our results generalize the cross-term findings by demonstrating that the effect can substantially vary between different brain conditions. Our results in AD patients that not all the variations in the pMD or nMD maps were also present in the gmMD maps emphasize the importance of accounting for the background gradients when comparing the DT-MRI data between groups with different brain conditions. In particular, the findings indicate that a bias toward increased MD variability can be introduced if the background gradients are not considered. For the FA index, there were no differences between the positive and negative acquisitions. This is not surprising because FA is derived by taking the ratios of the eigenvalues. The sensitivity to detect an effect on FA is substantially diminished as compared to that of MD, which is simply the average of the eigenvalues. Finally, although some previous investigators 2,37,38 have found significant differences of FA and MD between the MCI and CN patients, we did not find any significant differences for either FA or MD between these two groups. One explanation is that the MCI subjects in this study were only mildly impaired, as was reflected by their average MMSE score, which did not significantly differ from the score of the normal subjects. Another possibility is that our MCI group included only a few subjects with preclinical AD pathology as compared to that of the MCI groups in the other previous studies.\nIn general, the FA values in the white matter can be contaminated by signal from CSF spaces, which are more pronounced in AD than in CN subject. This will support increased MD and decreased FA values which showed several previous papers. However, in our study, we use the CSF-suppressed DTI method to minimize partial volume effect. Increased MD values in a voxel may be not directly related to CSF contamination. We think that this may be related to loss of integrity of neuronal structure. In this case, FA value can also decrease or increase dependent on the types of neuronal loss in the voxel. Previous findings of decreased FA in AD may be due to (1) neuronal loss in the voxel (microstructural changes) or (2) increased contributions of CSF signals caused by loss of cortical GM (atrophy; macroscopic changes) because many of previous studies did not use an inversion-recovery DTI sequence. A lot of CSF signals may be contributed to decreased FA values in AD in the previous findings. However, previous and our findings of increased FA in AD may be due to loss selectively in a certain direction rather than every neuron in the voxel (selective neuronal loss and microstructural changes). In addition, our finding of increased FA in AD may be additionally due to less contribution of CSF signals.\nIf brain atrophy is contributed to FA changes, then our finding may be unrelated to microstructural alternation. The recent paper has shown increased FA values in those patients, although they did not use any kinds of CSF suppression techniques. Teipel et al. found increased FA values in AD patients compared with elderly controls 39. This increased FA values in AD may be associated with a decrease in crossing fibers or other nonparallel organization 40. Teipel et al. 39 also found decreased FA values in AD patients compared with elderly control, but not in the present study. The largest difference between two studies is the selection of a statistical threshold. Teipel et al. 39 used uncorrected p value0.01, but we used FDR-corrected p value0.01 to consider multiple comparisons to reduce the false-positive findings. When we reinvestigated the results with the uncorrected p value0.01, then we also found decreased FA values in AD patients compared with elderly control in the temporal and frontal lobes which were similar findings from Teipel et al. 39. In addition, there is usually more gray matter loss in AD than in elderly normal subjects. Within a voxel which composes both gray matter and white matter, FA in our study can also be increased when there is gray matter loss without changing white matter volume because we acquired DTI data with suppressing signals from the brain atrophy. In this case, the relative contribution of white matter in the voxel can be increased. In general, people have been found increased MD and decreased FA in AD compared with normal. This decreased FA may only represent increased atrophy in a certain voxel because people have analyzed their FA data without correcting the atrophy contribution. In this study, we used an inversion-recovery DT-MRI sequence, which minimize the CSF contamination in a voxel. During FA analysis, we may find tissue alternations in the voxel, independent on the contributions of brain atrophy, which usually happens in gray matter. Therefore, it may be very important to correct the brain atrophy before analyzing FA maps, especially obtained FA maps in patients with AD.\nIn this study, MD values in some ROIs are higher in CN than in MCI. FA values in some ROIs are higher in MCI than in CN. We cannot clearly explain why this happens. However, we may think as the following: Although we divided the subject groups as MCI and CN based on the full neuropsychologic tests, the MMSE score does not significantly differ between two groups. In addition, although there is no significant difference of age between two groups, the MCI group is relatively younger than the CN group. As we found the results based on both the voxelwise and the ROI-based comparisons, there were no significant differences any indices between two groups. Although several previous studies found increased MD values and decreased FA values in AD compared with CN, some studies also did not found any differences between MCI and CN groups for both indices 40. In this case, the pathological changes in some areas in AD may not yet affect individuals with MCI. Furthermore, as we can see in Table 8, MD values in MCI are higher than those in CN in the right limbic parahippocampal gyrus, in the left middle temporal gyrus, and in the right and left limbic uncus, as expected. In addition, as we can see in Table 9, FA values in most ROIs are higher in CN than those in MCI, especially in the right and left superior temporal gyrus, as expected. The pathological changes in those areas may start to affect individuals with MCI. This may indicate regional variations of MD and FA values in patients with MCI compared with CN subjects.\nSeveral limitations of our study ought to be mentioned. Firstly, none of the AD patient had a definite diagnosis confirmed by autopsy. Therefore, the DTI alterations in the AD patients might not be related to AD at all. Another limitation is that we did not investigate the spatially variant background gradients for the higher order diffusion effects, such as kurtosis. Therefore, the contributions from these other effects might have biased our results. Another technical limitation is that the geometrical average maps, which are derived by averaging two signals, have a higher SNR than do the individual maps of diffusivity without averaging, and this leads to differences in sensitivity. Therefore, the findings of regional discrepancies between these maps are difficult to interpret. Finally, in this study, we mainly used a voxel-based analysis of the DTI indices of both MD and FA maps. Currently, the voxelbased analysis is still under investigating in optimization processing of DT-MRI data. Although the voxel-based analysis can be used a whole brain investigation without having a specific hypothesis, the results may be altered by several factors, such as a spatial normalization of DT-MRI data acquired with an EPI sequence, a coregistration between anatomic magnetic resonance images and maps of DTI indices, a filter size of smoothing kernel, andor registration of individual MD or FA maps onto a common space. Therefore, optimizations of the preprocessing and postprocessing steps are required to minimize any errors during processing 41,42.",

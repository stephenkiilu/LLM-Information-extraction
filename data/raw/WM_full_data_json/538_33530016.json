    "abstract": "Neurological and psychiatric illnesses are associated with regional brain deficit patterns that bear unique signatures and capture illness-specific characteristics. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) was developed to quantify brain similarity by comparing individual white matter microstructure, cortical gray matter thickness and subcortical gray matter structural volume measures with neuroanatomical deficit patterns derived from large-scale meta-analytic studies. We tested the specificity of the RVI approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) in a large epidemiological sample of UK Biobank (UKBB) participants (N  19,393; 9138 M10,255F; age  64.8  7.4 years). Compared to controls free of neuropsychiatric disorders, participants with MDD (N  2,248; 805 M1443F; age  63.4  7.4) had significantly higher RVI-MDD values (t  5.6, p  110 -8 ), but showed no detectable difference in RVI-AD (t  2.0, p  0.10). Subjects with dementia (N  7; 4 M3F; age  68.6  8.6 years) showed significant elevation in RVI-AD (t  4.2, p  310 -5 ) but not RVI-MDD (t  2.1, p  0.10) compared to controls. Even within affective illnesses, participants with bipolar disorder (N  54) and anxiety disorder (N  773) showed no significant elevation in whole-brain RVI-MDD. Participants with Parkinsons disease (N  37) showed elevation in RVI-AD (t  2.4, p  0.01) while subjects with stroke (N  247) showed no such elevation (t  1.1, p  0.3). In summary, we demonstrated elevation in RVI-MDD and RVI-AD measures in the respective illnesses with strong replicability that is relatively specific to the respective diagnoses. These neuroanatomic deviation patterns offer a useful biomarker for population-wide assessments of similarity to neuropsychiatric illnesses.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diagnosis of neuropsychiatric illnesses is based on meeting criteria for clinical symptoms, cognitive testing, behavioral observation, and neurological signs that may not be unique to any single illness. Many disorders show overlap: from genetic risk factors, to symptoms, to treatments, to deficit patterns. However, the disorder-oriented diagnosis system builds silos, or barriers, to understanding the degree of overlap and distinctions among diagnostic categories. We also lack robust brain imaging biomarkers to identify and separate among psychiatric disorders and neurological illnesses. Subject with neuropsychiatric disorders show deficits in the fractional anisotropy of white matter, cortical gray matter thickness and subcortical volume. These metrics are sensitive but not specific to any neuropsychiatric illness (Heresco-Levy et al., 2002;Hoffman et al., 2003;Kane et al., 1988;Kulkarni et al., 2015;Samara et al., 2016). Recently, epidemiological big data samples have become available that include neuroimaging across many individuals including people with psychiatric and neurological illnesses. These datasets allow identification of deficit patterns that are specific to the illnesses and can help re-define their unique and shared features (Kochunov et al., 2020a(Kochunov et al., , 2019b)). We present findings using the Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) to measure the similarity between an individual brain and the expected patterns derived from large scale meta-analyses using a representative psychiatric illness, major depressive disorder (MDD), and a representative neurological illness, Alzheimers disease (AD). We further evaluate the specificity of the RVI approach in related mood and neurodegenerative illnesses.\nLarge and inclusive meta-analytic studies conducted by big data consortia such as the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium (Thompson et al., 2017(Thompson et al., , 2020) and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Weiner et al., 2015(Weiner et al., , 2017) ) offer a principled way to define disease-related brain abnormalities. Several studies by ENIGMA and ADNI have reported patterns of patient-control group differences in the microstructural integrity of cerebral white matter tracts, cortical gray matter thickness and volumes of subcortical gray matter structures (Kelly et al., 2018;Kochunov et al., 2019c;Schmaal et al., 2017Schmaal et al., , 2016;;van Erp et al., 2016van Erp et al., , 2018;;van Velzen et al., 2019;Zavaliangos-Petropulu et al., 2019). These deficit patterns, expressed as regional effect sizes, are highly replicable (r  0.7-0.9) and predictive of deficit patterns in independent cohorts (Kochunov and Hong, 2014;Kochunov et al., 2019aKochunov et al., , 2016Kochunov et al., , 2019c) ) and cognitive impairment in people affected with these illnesses (Kochunov et al., 2020b). We proposed RVI as a simple measure of similarity between regionally derived metrics from an individuals brain MRI (e.g., regional volumes, thicknesses, microstructure measurements) and the expected pattern of those metrics with respect to the patient-control effect sizes derived from large-scale consortia.\nThe RVI approach assumes that the meta-analytic effect-sizes derived from such international consortia can serve as the ground truth for expected disorder-specific deficit patterns. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by showing that white matter RVI for schizophrenia predicted treatment resistance in schizophrenia better than any individual imaging measure (Kochunov et al., 2019a). We later demonstrated the similarity in white matter deficit patterns across psychiatric illnesses, suggesting that RVI serves as an important index for crossdisorder research (Kochunov et al., 2020a(Kochunov et al., , 2020b)). However, it is unknown if the RVI approach can be extended beyond schizophrenia. We calculated an RVI for MDD and AD in a large epidemiological sample of UK Biobank (UKBB) participants (N  19,393 with imaging data available at the time of this analysis). We evaluated the sensitivity of wholebrain RVI values and the RVIs for three types of neuroimaging measures: cortical gray matter thickness, subcortical volumes and white matter integrity; the three standard phenotypes indexed by ENIGMA workflows. The UKBB sample is composed of mainly healthy people. Approximately 10 of the sample are diagnosed with MDD but there are very few subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. Our primary aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of RVI-MDD and its specificity to other neighboring disorders that share mood symptoms. By using deficit patterns derived from ENIGMA (Thompson et al., 2017(Thompson et al., , 2020) ) and ADNI (Weiner et al., 2015(Weiner et al., , 2017) ) we tested the hypothesis that patterns of regional neuroanatomic deficits across neuropsychiatric illnesses -as captured by the RVI approach -are replicable and tested disease specificity.",

      "text": "We used the UKBB parser software (https:github.comUSC-IGCuk bb_parser) to identify N  4262 subjects with ICD codes corresponding to various neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Among participants with ICD codes for psychiatric illness, we identified N  2,248 (805 M1443F, age  63.4  7.4) subjects with a self-reported lifetime diagnosis of MDD. N  603 of MDD subjects also reported a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety disorder but were free from other neurological or psychiatric conditions. These subjects were kept in the analyses but post-hoc analyses were performed to test the main contrast while excluding these subjects. For psychiatric disorder comparisons, we identified subjects with mutually exclusive conditions. We identified N  773 subjects with lifetime self-reported anxiety disorder (385388F, age  65.3  7.2) and N  54 with bipolar disorder (21 M33F, age  63.2  5.7 years); who had no other reported neurological or psychiatric illnesses.\nAnxiety and BD are the two of the most common mood disorders and were selected to provide a stringent control that tested how well the RVI approach can differentiate among the different mood disorders.\nFor neurological illnesses, we identified N  7 subjects with Alzheimers Disease (4 M3F, age  68.6  8.6 years). To serve as our neurological comparison groups, we identified N  247 individuals with stroke (150 M97F, age  68.9  9.1 years) and N  37 with Parkinsons Disease (24 M14F, age  68.7  5.7 years). These subjects reported no other neurological illnesses. Parkinsons Disease and stroke were selected as neurological illness comparison groups because they are two of the most common age-related neurological disorders, and thus should provide a control to test the degree that RVI can separate neurological illnesses among those with shared clinical features. N  15,131 subjects (7530 M7601F, age  64.9  7.8 years.) who were free of ICD codes corresponding to neurological or psychiatric illnesses were treated as controls.",

The MDD-DTI effect size data were taken from the Table S4 (van Velzen et al., 2019). The MDD-Cortical effect sizes were taken from the Table S5 (Schmaal et al., 2017) and averaged for both hemispheres. Subcortical effect sizes were taken from the Table S4 (Schmaal et al., 2016). All MDD effect sizes were corrected for age, sex and their interaction and site effects; subcortical effect sizes were also corrected for medications.

      "text": "The ENIGMA consortium provided the meta-analytical ranks of the severity of regional deficits in gray matter thickness (33 cortical areas), subcortical volumes (8 structures) and fractional anisotropy (24 major white matter regions) in MDD compared to controls. These findings are presented as the MDD regional meta-analytical effect sizes reported as the Cohens d statistics after adjusting for age and sex (Table S1). Calculations for the tissue specific RVIs in UKBB subjects are as follows (using FA and MDD as an example): mean FA measures for each of the 24 major white matter regions were first converted to z values by (1) calculating the residual values by regressing out the effects of age, sex, their interaction and intracranial brain volume and (2) for each individual, subtracting the average value for a region and dividing it by the standard deviation calculated from the subjects who were free from neuropsychiatric disorders. This produced a vector of 24 normalized zvalues (35 values for gray matter thickness, 7 values for the subcortical volumes) for every individual in the sample. The regularization was performed once and for the entire sample. The individual white matter RVI for MDD and AD was then calculated as the correlation coefficient between 24 region-wise z values for the subject and their effect sizes for the MDD-control group differences in ENIGMA. The same procedure was used to generate a cortical thickness based RVI and a subcortical structural volume based RVI. The whole-brain RVI was calculated as the average of the three tissue-specific RVIs. The RVI calculator is distributed with the SOLAR-Eclipse software (www.solar-eclipse-genetics.org).",

Therefore, despite the large differences in sample sizes, the statistical doubledissociation data suggest some degree of disease specificity of the whole-brain, cross-tissue RVI approach for these two diagnoses.\nIn specific tissues, white matter (d  0.14, t  5.5, p  10 -7 ) and subcortical RVI-MDD (Cohens d  0.07, t  2.6, p  0.009) were significantly elevated in MDD patients compared to controls, while cortical RVI-MDD showed no significant differences (Cohens d  0.07, t  2.0, p  0.07) (Fig. 2B). None of the tissue specific RVI-MDD values showed significant difference in AD subjects when compared to controls (p  0.06-0.3) (Fig. 2D).\nPatients with AD showed significantly elevated RVI-AD for cortical thickness (Cohens d  1.28, t  3.8, p  10 -4 ), subcortical gray matter volume (Cohens d  0.81, t  2.4, p  0.01), and white matter (Cohens d  0.90, t  2.9, p  0.003) compared to controls (Fig. 2D). None of the tissue specific RVI-AD values showed significant differences in MDD patients when compared to controls (p  0.08-0.8) (Fig. 2D).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Using the largest available epidemiological dataset, we tested replication and sensitivity of the patterns of regional neuroanatomic deficits for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimers Disease. The whole-brain deficit patterns showed strong correlation between UKBB and ENIGMA for MDD and between UKBB and ADNI for AD. Tissue specific effect sizes were likewise correlated with an exception for cortical deficits for MDD, where the MDD-control differences were not significant in either the UKBB or ENIGMA samples. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) were significantly elevated in UKBB subjects with MDD and AD in the participants with these respective disorders. The effect sizes for the whole-brain and tissue specific RVI-MDD and AD in patient-control comparisons, were stronger than these for the wholebrain average white matter FA, gray matter thickness and individual subcortical measurements. This suggests that the patterns of similarity to a disorder may be a better predictor of vulnerability than absolute neuroimaging measurements. Testing across disorders showed evidence for specificity and suggested that disorder-specific deficit patterns is a useful biomarker for population-wide assessments of similarity to these neuropsychiatric illnesses.\nBig data studies have markedly improved the stability of neuroimaging findings and provided a strong rationale to use meta-analytic signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders as a measure of vulnerability at the individual level (Kochunov et al., 2020a(Kochunov et al., , 2019c)). The ENIGMA-MDD workgroup, in particular, has reported regional patterns of white matter, cortical and subcortical deficits in patients by assembling the largest and most inclusive samples to date (Schmaal et al., 2017(Schmaal et al., , 2016;;van Velzen et al., 2019). In this study, the MDD deficit patterns derived by these ENIGMA studies showed a strong correlation (r  0.76) with the patient-control regional effect sizes in the UKBB sample at the wholebrain level. The high effect sizes for white matter, cortical and subcortical deficit patterns observed in ADNI population were like the effect sizes observed in UKBB subjects despite a very small sample (N  7). The alignment of the whole-brain deficit patterns supports whole-brain RVI for combining measures to assess individual similarity to a disease in terms of its expected neuroanatomical deficit patterns.\nThe patient-control effect size for whole-brain RVI were stronger than the average effect sizes for whole-brain FA, whole-brain cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes. Similarly, tissue specific RVIs had higher effect sizes than those for individual neuroimaging measures for the respective domains. RVI is a correlation coefficient between the neuroanatomic regional deficit patterns in an individual and the deficit patterns of a disease. Therefore, RVI is complementary to the individuals regional deficit measurements. The deficit patterns were defined for a specific tissue type and whole-brain, cross-tissue imaging data. RVI is calculated based on regional effect sizes derived by comparing affected subjects with healthy controls. Whether the data generated can be used to compare RVI between two diseases is unclear and limits the statistical comparison of RVIs between two illnesses. Another limitation is that whole brain RVI calculations require the availability of the regional effect sizes across the three tissue types. Among the illnesses discussed in this study, only MDD in ENIGMA and AD from ADNI have such data presently available, which is one of the reasons that this study is focusing on these two illnesses. Using this approach, the whole-brain RVI-MDD and RVI-AD were significantly elevated only in patients with these respective illnesses when compared to controls free of neuropsychiatric disorders, supporting disease specificity.\nWe further examined whether the RVI approach can separate not just psychiatric and neurological diseases, but also other illnesses within psychiatric and neurological categories. We calculated RVI-MDD in subjects with bipolar and anxiety disorders, as these are affective disorders with overlapping clinical symptoms. Their diagnostic separation is based on clinical history and interviews and there are no biological metrics that can consistently separate among them. Specificity testing showed no significant elevation in the whole-brain RVI-MDD in patients with bipolar disorders or anxiety disorders. However, participants with bipolar disorder showed significant elevation in the white matter RVI-MDD. This was expected given a prior finding of some overlap (r  0.28) between white matter deficit patterns in these disorders (Kochunov et al., 2020a). There was no significant elevation in cortical or subcortical RVI-MDD in participants with bipolar disorder and no significant elevation of any tissue specific RVI-MDD in participants with anxiety disorders. This suggests that the regional deficit patterns in anxiety disorders, and to a lesser extent bipolar disorder, were not as closely aligned with MDD despite similarity in symptoms. This also supports the potential use of RVI or RVI-like approaches for crossdiagnostic research, objective diagnostic differentiation and unique and shared anatomic deficit patterns.\nEvaluation of RVI-AD in two other aging-related neurological disorders showed that participants with Parkinsons disease (PD) showed significant elevation in the whole-brain RVI-AD, although at about half of the effect size as in participants with AD. Participants with stroke did not show significantly elevated RVI-AD. Participants with AD showed highly significant elevation in all three tissue-specific RVI with the largest effects observed for subcortical RVI, followed by cortical and white matter RVI, in line with the significant structural alterations in brains of subjects with AD. Subjects with PD showed elevation in the whole brain RVI-AD as well as the RVI-AD values for the white matter and subcortical patterns. PD is the most common age-related neurodegenerative brain disorders with up to 80 of patients converging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD or other type of dementia, especially in the later, more fulminant stage (Aarsland et al., 2017). The risk of this conversion is higher for PD patients with cognitive deficits that show overlap with these for AD (Aarsland et al., 2017). The risks for developing cognitive deficits in patients with PD are linked to the subcortical volume changes including reduction in hippocampus and white matter atrophy (Lanskey et al., 2018). Therefore, we speculate that the higher RVI-AD indices in this disease may be driven by some of the brain changes in subjects with PD that coincided with changes in AD as captured by the RVI-AD.\nStroke is another aging-related neurological disorder associated with an elevated risk for AD (Garcia-Alloza et al., 2011;Honig et al., 2003;Kalaria et al., 2008;Luchsinger et al., 2005). We observed widespread regional deficits in cerebral white matter and significantly lower subcortical volumes in subjects with stroke (Table S1). However, there was no significant elevation in RVI-AD white matter or cortical values and only a slight elevation (Cohens d  0.16) in subcortical RVI-AD values in subjects with stroke. This shows the specificity of the RVI-AD construct even in subjects who otherwise had significantly reduced cerebral integrity. Stroke is characterized by the variability and heterogeneity of lesions due to the diversity of its risk factors, types, causes, and locations which leads to a significant reduction in overall cerebral integrity. While these patterns do not overlap with those observed in AD, cerebrovascular lesions are risk factors for cognitive deficits and eventual reduction in hippocampal volume (Garcia-Alloza et al., 2011), and is likely contributing to the elevated RVI-AD subcortical measurements. Similarly, AD pathophysiology harbors cerebrovascular damage as one of the hallmarks of the disease, particularly on the microvascular level that may be outside the range of standard detection parameters in clinical practice.\nThis study has several other limitations. The UKBB is a sample of mainly healthy individuals and has a very small number of subjects with AD and other neurodegenerative illnesses. Our primary aim was to evaluate the elevation of RVI-AD in the MDD sample as the test of specificity between the two disorders. However, given very large effect sizes of AD on cerebral integrity we were able to readily replicate AD patterns in this sample, however, these results lack statistical power. At present, we do not have data to calculate RVI for bipolar and anxiety disorders, PD, or stroke and cannot conduct reciprocal testing of these findings. N  603 of MDD subjects also reported a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Post-hoc analyses excluded these subjects and resulted in similar outcomes. The study is also limited as it is based on the existing UKBB sample which is cross-sectional and much of the UKBB diagnosis data is self-reported and not verified by independent clinical interviews (Bycroft et al., 2018). The UKBB sample is focused on subjects in the 5th to 8th decades of life and the interaction between the diagnosis and aging trajectories for different diagnoses may be reflected in RVI values. These limitations reduced our ability to test the predictive validity of the RVI constructs across the major psychiatric vs. neurological conditions. Expansion of these large data sets into different phases of life as well as different phases of disease would allow for improvement upon this validity. With longitudinal data of at-risk populations, development and testing of these findings can be more broadly applied with diagnostic and even causal linkages.",

      "text": "We used big data-derived deficit patterns to measure similarity between the brain structural and microstructural patterns in an individual and the expected patterns in MDD and AD as calculated by the regional vulnerability index (RVI) for each disease. We tested the utility of RVIbased phenotypes for assessing individual resemblance to distinct (AD vs. MDD) vs. similar mood psychiatric (bipolar disorder, anxiety) and aging-related neurological (PD, stroke) diseases. The results demonstrated that the RVI-derived disease markers may be replicable across big data samples and can reasonably differentiate across categories of diseases, especially when effects across different tissue types are considered. These findings encourage longitudinal studies, especially studies of prodromal subjects and across a broader range of diseases, to test the predictive validity to RVI as a vulnerability index.",

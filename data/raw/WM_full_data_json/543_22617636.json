      "text": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disease associated with cognitive, affective and functional impairment that, in clinical practice with elderly patients, may be difficult to differentiate from behavioral impairment disorders associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) 16. Moreover, BD has been considered as a risk factor for developing dementia 13.\nThe relationship between BD and AD has been established in some studies based on the overlapping symptoms, mood and cognition are considered the core problems in BD and AD, respectively, moreover, both diseases show response to some common treatments. For example, lithium treatment appears to prevent the development of AD in patients with BD 12,17,28, and mood stabilizers used to treat BD 16 are increasingly been utilized to control behavioral symptoms of AD.\nDespite these common points between both disorders, dementia syndrome arising as a result of bipolarity does not seem to correspond to the criteria of AD 11. Interestingly, to date no specific biomarker discriminating between BD and AD has been identified. Effort directed toward phenotyping BD and AD using neuroimaging measures in addition to other clinical information might yield important insights into the nature of illness. Therefore the aim of this study is the analysis of white matter integrity, which may help to discriminate among BD and AD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This new type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only non-invasive technology that can provide information about axonal tracts integrity, allowing to investigate neuropathological mechanism underlying white matter (WM) changes. Thus, this method is becoming an important research and clinical tool 14. Recent DTI studies 5,25 show microscopic WM pathology in both BD and AD patients. Based on geometry and the degree of anisotropy loss, WM pathology can be documented.\nTwo metrics of the diffusion properties are commonly employed as indices of tissue characteristics, mean diffusivity (MD) which measures the magnitude of water molecule diffusion, and fractional anisotropy (FA) which is an index of the degree of directionality of water diffusivity. Both have been used extensively as markers of WM integrity, including in normal aging, BD and in AD. Recent works show that CAD systems for AD can be built on MRI T1 weighted data 23, and either FA or MD data 9. In 9 FA was found a better source for discriminant features than MD.\nAlthough research has revealed a great deal about AD, the cause or causes of AD remain unknown 27 and the same holds true for BD. Early diagnosis is crucial to mitigate their negative effects. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been considered desirable in order to improve the prediction accuracy complementing the neuropsychological assessments performed by expert clinicians. Such CAD based on machine learning are increasingly applied in the neurosciences, and concretely in clinical diagnoses. For instance, 20 identified proteins related with the diagnosis of AD using predictive analysis of microarrays (PAM), with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.\nIn this letter, we discuss findings of affected brain connectivity supported by the validation of CAD system built on FA data. We report results of an on-going study using results of CAD discrimination between BD and AD based on FA data for the identification of effects in WM tracts. We report the localization in a probabilistic tractography atlas of the discriminant regions found by our feature selection approach and discuss the specific brain function mechanisms that can be affected.",

      "text": "Patients included in the present study with AD and BD were referred to the psychiatric unit at Alava University Hospital, Vitoria from the hospital catchment area for the investigation of memory complaints. All patients were living independently in the community. Healthy volunteers with an MMSE score of 26 were recruited from the community through advertisements, nonrelated members of the patients families or caregivers relatives. Selected subjects underwent a standard protocol including: clinical evaluation, a cognitive and a neuropsychological evaluation, and brain imaging (MRI). Cognitive status was screened in all groups with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Cambridge cognitive examination (CAMCOG).\nFifty-seven elderly subjects were included in the present study. The subjects were divided in three groups. The AD group included 20 subjects fulfilling the NINDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. The BD group included 12 subjects fulfilling DSM IVs criteria 16, all of them were bipolar I with a late onset of the disease. The healthy control group included 25 subjects without memory complaints. Subjects with psychiatric disorders (i.e. major depression) or other conditions (i.e. brain tumors) were not considered for this study. Demographic information for AD, BD, HC subjects is: age (mean (SD)) years: 78.65 (4.79), 69.55 (7.58), 71.65 (8.55); gender (malefemale): 812, 75, 1213. MMSE scores: 19 (14-24), 25 (22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28), 29 (27)(28)(29)(30); CAMCOG (mean (SD)): 58.68 (19.50), 75.36 (11.40), 92.88 (8.14); medications (n): lithium (0,0,0), risperidone (3,3,0), quetiapine (1,3,0), olanzapine (0,3,0).\nStructural MRI and DTI data were used to build and validate the CAD approach. MR scanning was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens). Study protocol consists of 3D T1-weighted acquisition (isometric 1 mm  1 mm  1 mm, 176 slices, TR  1900 ms, TE  337 ms and FOV  25676), a 3D Flair sequence (isometric 1 mm  1 mm  1 mm, 176 slices, TR  5000 ms, TE  333 ms and FOV  26087.5) and diffusion weighted sequence (slice thickness  5 mm, 19 slices, TR  2700 ms, TE  88 ms, matrix 120100, 3 averages, b  1000 and 30 gradient directions) allowing fast acquisition minimizing the risk movement artifacts due to the agitated nature of the subjects.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an MRI method that produces in vivo MR images of biological tissues weighted with the local characteristics of water diffusion, allowing to study the integrity of the WM fibers 3,19. The magnetic field homogeneity is varied linearly by a pulsed field gradient. Since precession is proportional to the magnet strength, the protons begin to precess at different rates, resulting in dispersion of the phase and signal loss. Wherever there are ordered structures such as axonal tracts in nervous tissues or protein filaments in muscle, water molecules tend to have anisotropic diffusion along such structures.\nDiffusion is a real-valued second order tensor that can be represented by six independent parameters: D  D ij ; i, j  x, y, z which can be estimated from the DWI signals obtained using six or more non-collinear gradient directions. DTI consists in the visualization of the diffusion tensor at each voxel site represented in its eigen-vector coordinate system e1, e2, e3 with eigen-values  1 , 2 , 3 . The scalar measure of water diffusion computed from DTI is the fractional anisotropy (FA), FA",

      "text": "We have realized three computational experiments (a) HC vs. AD, (b) HC vs. BD, and (c) AD vs. BD. Separate feature extraction and classification validation processes were carried out on the corresponding datasets. The classifier is a linear kernel SVM 8. Using age, gender and other demographic variables as features in the multivariate models did not have any effect on the predictive power of the models separating the group when all image variables were included. Therefore they are excluded from the analysis.\nThe discriminant voxels found by our procedure were localized on a probabilistic tractography atlas (The John Hopkins University (JHU) WM tractography atlas 15 provided by the FSL software distribution). We found significant percentage of localization in seven major WM tracts in each hemisphere (anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum-cingulate gyrus, cingulum-hippocampus gyrus, cortico-spinal tract, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus) and two commissural tracts (forceps minor and forceps major). Discriminative features were localized in different tracts when comparing AD vs. HC, BD vs. HC and AD vs. BD.\nThe average values of the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity classification performance measures obtained from leave one out cross-validation procedures for the feature vectors obtained with specific percentile values of the correlation empirical distribution are presented in Figs. 234. Classifications results are excellent. For AD vs. BD classification process, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 100 for all the feature vector sizes tested both for FA data. For BD vs. HC, results on FA data are 100 accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for most feature vectors considered. For AD vs. HC, results are also good but decreasing when the number of features is low.",

      "text": "Myelin plays a critical role in the complex connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that myelin breakdown can be a contributing factor to pathology of both aging and age-related brain disorders. This study uses DTI data for discrimination of BD from AD in an elderly sample of patients. We first found voxel-wise FA changes on the entire brain showing that features extracted from DTI data are discriminant of BD patients, AD patients and healthy control subjects, yielding highly accurate classification results of CAD systems for AD and BD. Previous studies found that microstructural WM damage associated with normal aging, BD or AD is not homogeneously distributed, but it rather involves selectively brain WM regions. Brain WM is often categorized into different tract groups including limbic, commissural association, and projection tracts. Therefore, this study uses an atlas-based automated approach to investigate the integrity of the principal WM tracts in BD and AD patients. To our best knowledge, this is the first study reporting changes in specific tracts that can be identified as biomarkers to differentiate BD from AD.\nIn this study, tract based spatial statistics show that forceps minor, superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus are particularly involved when the three groups (AD, BD and HC) are compared. Interestingly, we found that the tracts of interest (TOIs), allowing a greater discrimination among the diagnosis groups, are late-myelinating pathways. This finding is in accordance to the retrogenesis theory which posits that WM degeneration follows a pattern reversing myelogenesis presenting a heightened vulnerability of later myelinating pathways. This theory proposes that the processes of myelin development, maintenance, and repair underlie our species unique vulnerability to highly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders in late life such as BD or AD 2.\nThe identified discriminant tracts support cognitive functions known to be compromised in AD and BD: (a) Inferior longitudinal fasciculus connects occipital and temporal lobe structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. These structures have been implicated in a wide range of both cognitive and affective domains in AD and in BD 26. (b) Superior longitudinal fasciculus contains connections among the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. This network has been suggested to be involved in attention and language, motor behavior and somatosensory information. Some authors suggest that abnormalities in these tracts may therefore be related to some of the attentional and cognitive deficits found in BD 29 and with cognitive performance in AD 22. (c) The results of previous studies 7 the callosum suggest that impairment of the interhemispheric communication may be a common feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The presence of DTI data abnormalities in the corpus callosum in AD and in BD patients is consistent with previous reports 7. Concurrently, WM changes in forceps minor have been detected in early stages of AD 18, suggesting affection of the corpus callosums genu.\nOur findings also agree with the results of a previous DTI study which revealed significant connectivity disruptions within the association fiber tracts 10, contributing to understanding both mood disregulation and cognitive disturbances in these patients. Damage of WM tracts connecting cortical areas might hamper the connectivity between them and disregulate the brain networks involved in mood and cognition 6. Some limitations of our study need to be taken into account. Due to the variety of medication and the small number of patients taking each drug, analysis of medication effects is difficult to assess in the present study. Moreover, this is a cross-sectional study with a relatively small number of participants and the findings need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies with larger cohorts.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "This study finds that micro-structural parameters, measured by DTI, allow to discriminate among the diagnosis groups, yielding highly accurate classification results supporting the proposal of CAD systems for AD and BD. Best classification results are obtained on the feature vectors extracted applying a 99.95 percentile of the correlation distribution computed from the FA data, achieving accuracy  100, sensitivity  100 and specificity  100 in a leave-one-out cross-validation, improving reported CAD attempts based on functional MRI and SPECT images 24,21 for AD. Therefore, the proposed feature extraction from DTI data is very effective providing a good discrimination among AD patients, BD patients and HC that can be exploited by the classifier construction algorithms.\nMoreover, these classification results support the validity of effects on WM tracts identified by the localization of the discriminant voxels on a probabilistic tractography atlas. Interestingly in our sample the more severe changes were found in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the forceps minor. As there is not specific biomarker for the AD and BD diagnosis, using neuroimaging devices will considerably reduce diagnostic uncertainty. The recruitment of new patients and healthy controls data is under way to allow for a more extensive proof of the approach. Other DTI features such as radial diffusivity will be studied for comparison of effect findings.",

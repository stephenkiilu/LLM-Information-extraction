    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Older adults with lower intake and tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) have more brain white matter lesions (WMLs), an association suggesting that small-vessel ischemic disease, a major contributor to the development of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, may be preventable through ω-3 treatment. OBJECTIVE To determine whether ω-3 treatment reduces WML accumulation in older adults without dementia harboring WMLs and with suboptimal ω-3 status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with treatment stratification by apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOEE4) carrier status used linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean annual change between groups. The study was conducted at Oregon Health  Science University, a major academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest, from May 2014 to final participant visit in September 2019. Data analysis concluded in July 2022. Participants were adults without dementia aged 75 years and older with WMLs greater than or equal to 5 cm 3 and plasma ω-3 PUFA less than 5.5 weight percentage of total. INTERVENTION Three-year treatment with 1.65 g of ω-3 PUFA (975 mg of EPA and 650 mg of DHA) vs a soybean oil placebo matched for taste, smell, and appearance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was annual WML progression measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included diffusion tensor imaging of fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA), representing neuronal integrity breakdown. RESULTS A total of 102 participants (62 women 60.8; mean age, 81 years range, 75-96 years) were equally randomized, 51 per treatment group. Although the ω-3 group had less annual WML accumulation than the placebo group, the difference was not statistically significant (1.19 cm 3 95 CI, 0.64-1.74 cm 3  vs 1.34 cm 3 95 CI, 0.80-1.88 cm 3 ; P  .30). Similarly, the ω-3 group had less annual DTI-FA decline than the placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant (-0.0014 mm 2 s 95 CI, -0.0027 to 0.0002 mm 2 s vs -0.0027 mm 2 s 95 CI, -0.0041 to -0.0014 mm 2 s; P  .07). Among APOEE4 carriers, the annual DTI-FA decline was significantly lower in the group treated with ω-3 than the placebo group (-0.0016 mm 2 s 95 CI, -0.0032 to 0.0020 mm 2 s vs -0.0047 mm 2 s 95 CI, -0.0067 to -0.0025 mm 2 s; P  .04). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups. (continued) Key Points Question Does ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment reduce cerebral white matter lesion (WML) accumulation and neuronal integrity breakdown among older adults? Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 102 participants, ω-3 treatment failed to significantly reduce WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants; however, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOEE4) carriers who received ω-3 had significant reductions in neuronal integrity breakdown over 3 years. Meaning Although ω-3 treatment failed to reach significant reduction in WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants at risk for dementia, the findings suggest that APOEE4 carriers may benefit from ω-3 treatment.",

      "text": "Cerebral white matter lesion (WML) accumulation, identified as hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans, are thought to play a major role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD). 1,2 WMLs are associated with risk for cognitive decline and AD, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy and arteriosclerosis coexist among approximately 80 of probable AD cases examined at autopsy. 34567 The WML pathophysiological mechanisms involve endothelial cell activation and blood-brain barrier breakdown, cerebral hypoperfusion, and reduced regenerative capacity of oligodendrocytes. 891011 The confluent WMLs that abut the ventricles and span deeper into the subcortical tissue may be more representative of astrogliosis, axonal degeneration, and a progressive myelin loss, whereas isolated periventricular WMLs may be more indicative of microglial activation as a neuroinflammatory response to peripheral stimuli through a disturbed blood-brain barrier. 121314 Whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging of fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA) is an indicator of white matter microstructural integrity associated with cognitive function that declines with aging, particularly among apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOEE4) carriers. 151617 Diet-derived bioactive lipids, such as the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6), which are found in deep, cold-water fish, 18 and the plasma concentrations that manifest from their consumption are associated with reduced WML burden. 19,20 These ω-3 PUFAs are modifiable structural phospholipids that may alter cell signaling and metabolism toward a less inflammatory state by acting as substrate for synthesis of lipophilic inflammation-resolving metabolites 21 ; ω-3 has been shown to reduce microglial cytokine release (ie, tumor necrosis factor--α) and endothelial and immune cell surface protein CD54 expression. 22,23 CD54 protein encoding inferred by the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene locus can increase blood-brain barrier permeability. 24 Meta-analyses of ω-3 clinical trials have shown that it can downregulate soluble adhesion molecules, specifically ICAM-1, although other ω-3 trials have identified modest effects on cerebral perfusion and white matter integrity parameters. 22,25,26 Plasma ω-3 explains 24 of the WML variation, and higher levels are associated with a 40 reduction in probability for WML among older adults. 19,20 Plasma ω-3 concentrations above 11.0 mgdL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0355) are associated with less WML-mediated executive cognitive function decline in older adults without dementia, 27 and 1.65 g per day of ω-3 has been shown clinically to supersede this hypothetical neuroprotective threshold in mild-to-moderate AD. Consequently, we targeted enrollment to a population of older adults harboring WMLs and suboptimal ω-3 status to determine whether ω-3 treatment prevents WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown over 3 years vs a placebo.",

Mass-mailers and subsequent telephone screenings of 1100 people identified 299 candidates for invitation to an in-clinic assessment of general and neurological signs and symptoms, cognition, blood ω-3 status, and WMLs. The first clinic visit including ω-3 status yielded 233 candidates for WML MRI screening.

      "text": "The primary outcome was annual WML progression. Secondary outcomes were DTI-FA, medial temporal lobe gray matter (GM), and total brain GM. Treatment stratification by APOE genotype was prespecified. Baseline brain MRI was captured using a 3-T MRI instrument (Total Imaging Matrix Trio; Siemens) with phased array body transmit radiofrequency (RF) coil and a 32-channel head RF coil receiver housed in the OHSU Advanced Imaging Research Center. The Total Imaging Matrix Trio scanner was upgraded to a 3-T Prisma (Siemens) during the study. The RF receiver coil and sequence parameters were consistent across the upgrade, and the Prisma system was used for 32 of the 87 participants with a 1-year follow-up visit and each scan from there forward. Anatomical imaging sequences were similar to the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative protocols. 31 . Briefly, GM volume of the medial temporal lobe, total brain, and ventricular cerebral spinal fluid volumes were segmented with FreeSurfer software version 6.0 (Harvard University), visually inspected, and manually corrected for errors. For FLAIR-derived WMLs, a semiautomated intensity-based thresholding algorithm using resampled 1 mm isotropic resolution images was used. 28,32 FLAIR images were linearly coregistered to T1 images, and the mean FLAIR signal intensity in the WM was calculated. Voxel clusters at least 2.5 SD above the mean WM FLAIR signal intensity were used as seeds. The mean signal intensity of each cluster was calculated and compared with all surrounding voxels. Adjacent voxels of at least 95 of the cluster mean signal intensity were added to the cluster, and the process was repeated iteratively. The final WML mask was visually inspected and manually corrected before final volume calculation. After study completion, updated neuroimaging processing algorithms included analysis of higher resolution sequences (FLAIR, in-plane resolution 0.5 mm). Mean skeletal DTI-FA and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity were calculated using tract-based spatial statistics. 33 Cognitive changes were not powered adequately but collected rather comprehensively to power future efforts (eAppendix in Supplement 2).",

Statistical power and sample size were informed by the longstanding Oregon Brain Aging Study (OBAS) cohort of participants aged 80 years and older with CDR less than or equal to 0.5 and WML greater than or equal to 6 cm 3 , which was prevalent in 80 of the OBAS cohort. Simulation analysis estimated that the current trial placebo group should accumulate a mean (SD) of 7 (5) cm 3 of WML over 3 years. However, during recruitment efforts, the prevalence of WML greater than or equal to 6 cm 3 was 46.7 (109 of 233 participants), and documented protocol modifications were made to meet enrollment without sacrificing the primary hypotheses. Therefore, the threshold for WML inclusion was lowered to 5 cm 3 , age to 75 years or older, and sample size from 150 to 100 participants. Together, these modifications sustained 80 power to test the hypothesis that ω-3 attenuates annual WML progression by 50 compared with the placebo (ie, mean SD, 3.5 5.0 cm 3 over 3 years in ω-3 group vs 7.0 5.0 cm 3 in the placebo group). Considering 30 attrition over 3 years, a total of 94 individuals were required, with 33 completers per treatment group.\nDifferences in annual change among study outcomes by treatment group were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, as described elsewhere, 28 using R statistical software version 4.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing), 37 with lme4, 38 nlme, 39 and ggplot2 40 plot packages. 28 Treatment stratification by APOE genotype was prespecified. Interaction terms between treatment and time evaluated annualized change differences by group. Model covariates included baseline age, sex, history of vascular disease (yesno, indicating any one of the following: history of cardiac arrest, angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac bypass surgery, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation), history of hypertension (yesno), history of depression (yesno), and MRI system used. MRI system was included as a covariate for the volumetric and diffusion MRI outcomes to account for system upgrade during the trial and MRI volumes (eg, WML, total brain volume, medial temporal lobe volume, and ventricular volume) were adjusted for intracranial volume at each MRI visit. Estimates and 95 CIs for WML were calculated on the original scale of cubic centimeters using linear mixedeffects models (ie, using pretransformed WML as outcomes) to provide crude annual volume change and same covariate corrections. Adverse events were analyzed using Fisher exact test in all randomized participants who received treatment.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This randomized clinical trial in older adults with suboptimal ω-3 status and WMLs, the neurovascular pathology thought to be impacted by the intervention, examined whether ω-3 treatment can slow WML progression over 3 years. Although the treatment was safe and well tolerated, it failed to significantly reduce WML compared with the soybean oil placebo. However, some differential effects by APOE genotype were identified in a prespecified secondary outcome representing reduction in neuronal integrity breakdown with ω-3 intervention.\nOur enrollment of participants aged 75 years and older with WML burden (Ն5 cm 3 ) and suboptimal ω-3 status (11.0 mgdL or 5.5 weight percentage) was successful in that there was an accelerated rate of WML accumulation compared with previous studies. 41,42 However, preliminary data from the OBAS had a mean WML accumulation of 7 cm 3 over 3 years, whereas a total of 4 to 5 cm 3 of WML accumulation was observed in the current trial. 43 Less WML accumulation would dilute the statistical power and increase the number of individuals needed to see change and possibly affect the duration of treatment needed to observe efficacy. This may explain why the ITT analysis failed to reach statistical significance for the primary outcome of annual WML, secondary outcome of DTI-FA, and exploratory outcomes of DTI-radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity in the ω-3-treated group. Although ω-3 effects on WML progression in APOEE4 carriers did not reach significance, APOEE4 carriers treated with ω-3 had significantly less neuronal integrity breakdown (DTI-FA). The larger neuronal integrity breakdown seen in APOEE4 carriers that we (and others 44,45 ) have observed further supports sample size as a potential important limitation to our ability to detect universal effects of ω-3 on WML and DTI-FA among all participants. 46 This trial was not powered to detect differences between APOEE4 carriers and noncarriers and may contribute to the nonsignificant direct comparisons. Regardless, the differential effects of ω-3 we observed on neuronal integrity breakdown by APOE genotype has yet to be reported and requires further confirmation. 47 The ω-3 PUFA formula using both EPA and DHA combined but more concentrated with EPA was justified because both are brain penetrant lipids, 48 plasma EPA plus DHA explains 24 of the total WML volume in older adults, and EPA had the largest association with less WML (ie, largest loading coefficient from the in silico model). 19 EPA is also more abundant than DHA in the microglia and has a more profound ability to reduce microglial proinflammatory cytokine release and endothelial cell activation that permits peripheral immune cell entry to the brain. 24,495051 Clinical trials of 18 months and longer that have tested ω-3 at 1 g or more have either administered DHA solely or a DHA-dominant formula with small quantities of EPA. For example, the Multi-domain Alzheimer Prevention Trial randomized people to 3 years of a lifestyle intervention with and without DHA of 800 mg and EPA of 225 mg but failed to achieve cognitive benefit. 52 Another trial used DHA of 2 g daily for 18 months for individuals with mild-to-moderate AD and failed to achieve effects on AD progression and neuroimaging outcomes of whole brain and hippocampal volume atrophy. 30 However, DHA did reduce Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive progression in noncarriers of the APOEE4 allele. 30 The current trial of an EPA-dominant formula failed to significantly reduce WML progression in all participants, but neuronal integrity breakdown in APOEE4 carriers did appreciate benefit as early as 1 year after ω-3 treatment. Together these findings suggest that an EPA-dominant formula may provide some benefit in APOEE4 carriers with no dementia and WMLs, and DHA-dominant formulas may benefit noncarriers of APOEE4 with mild-to-moderate AD. Trial formula daily doses of DHA range from 0.650 to 2 g and from 0 to 0.975 g of EPA, and the treatment duration range is from 6 months to 3 years. The disease stage of each interventional trial has also varied from older, community-based, cognitively intact individuals to those with mild cognitive impairment to those with mild-to-moderate AD. All these trials thus far could be augmented with adherence biomarkers to ensure that the hypothesized neuroprotective blood thresholds observed in preliminary studies are achieved by each participant by trial study exit. 27,28 As a result of substantial heterogeneity in ω-3 dosages and formula and the duration of treatment and disease",

As further validation, assessment of participants who completed the study before and after the upgrade had no differences in WML and DTI-FA as a function of the MRI system. The ω-3 effects on whole-brain DTI-FA includes WML across voxels; therefore, the effects on DTI-FA independent of WMLs in APOEE4 carriers remains an open question. WML progression was less than anticipated, and, therefore, this trial may have been underpowered to reasonably detect WML effects under ITT. Similarly, this study was not powered to directly compare effects between APOEE4 carriers and noncarriers.",

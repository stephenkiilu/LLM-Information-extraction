    "abstract": "Gamma entrainment through sensory stimulation has the potential to reduce the pathology of Alzheimers disease in mouse models. However, clinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD) patients have yielded inconsistent results, necessitating further investigation. This single-center pre-post intervention study aims to explore the influence of white matter microstructural integrity on gamma rhythm propagation from the visual cortex to AD-affected regions in 31 cognitively normal volunteers aged  65. Gamma rhythm propagation induced by optimal FLS was measured. Diffusion tensor imaging was employed to assess the integrity of white matter tracts of interest. After excluding 5 participants with a deficit in steadystate visually evoked potentials, 26 participants were included in the final analysis. In the linear regression analyses, gamma entrainment was identified as a significant predictor of gamma propagation (p  0.001). Furthermore, the study identified white matter microstructural integrity as a significant predictor of gamma propagation by flickering light stimulation (p  0.05), which was specific to tracts that connect occipital and temporal or frontal regions. These findings indicate that, despite robust entrainment of gamma rhythms in Yeseung Park and Euisuk Yoon contributed equally to this work.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential of modulating brain activity by rhythmic sensory stimulation, in particular gamma rhythms, as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimers disease (AD) 123. Gamma rhythms, which are intrinsic oscillatory patterns in the 30-80 Hz frequency range, have been linked to various cognitive processes, including attention 4, memory retention 5, and sensory perception 6. It has been suggested that alterations in these rhythms may be linked to the cognitive deficits observed in AD, which could make them a focus for therapeutic intervention 123. Furthermore, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation such as 40 Hz flickering light stimulation (FLS) has been demonstrated to reduce brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau and to improve cognitive function in transgenic AD mice 789. Gamma entrainment is a process whereby brain activity is synchronized to external stimuli at gamma frequencies 10.\nWhile encouraging findings have been observed in preclinical studies 789, the clinical trials investigating the efficacy of gamma entrainment using 40 Hz combined visual and auditory stimulation in patients with AD have yielded inconsistent results 111213. Our previous work indicated that the discrepancy in the efficacy of gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation between mice and humans may be attributable to the potential differences in the optimal parameters of sensory stimulation for entraining gamma rhythms between mice and humans. For example, 32 Hz was more effective for gamma entrainment using FLS than 40 Hz in older adults in our previous work. The 32 Hz FLS entrained gamma rhythms 200 more strongly and 125 more widely in 137 more participants than the 40 Hz FLS 14. In addition, the intensity of visual stimulation used in previous clinical trials varied considerably, ranging widely from 192 to 1400 cd m 2 11-13, 15, 16. In our previous work in diurnal humans, we found that 700 cdm 2 FLS entrained gamma rhythms in the visual cortex 107 and 156 more than 400 cdm 2 and 100 cdm 2 , respectively, and propagated gamma rhythms 125 more to frontotemporal regions than 400 cdm 2 FLS 14. These results suggest that gamma entrainment and propagation may be considerably influenced by the light intensity of visual stimulation. Previous preclinical studies employed rather strong light stimulation for nocturnal mice. They used approximately 300 cdm 2 FLS, which is double the 150 cdm 2 that has been shown to induce retinal neurodegeneration in nocturnal mice 17,18.\nHowever, it is important to note that the lack of consistent observations of gamma entrainment in clinical trials cannot be attributed solely to inter-species differences in extrinsic factors such as frequency or intensity of external sensory stimulation. It is also due to interindividual differences in the intrinsic factors involved in the spread of gamma rhythms in humans. It is clear that if the gamma rhythms entrained in the sensory cortex by external sensory stimuli are not properly propagated to other brain regions where the pathology of AD occurs, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation may not have the desired therapeutic effect in patients with AD. Propagation refers to the spread of gamma rhythms, which are initially entrained in the sensory cortex synchronized to external stimuli, to other interconnected brain regions, facilitating coordinated neural activity and information processing 19. In propagating gamma rhythms entrained in the primary sensory cortex to other brain regions affected by AD including the temporal and frontal regions 202122232425, the microstructural integrity of white matter plays a pivotal role. However, the microstructural integrity of white matter differs considerably not only between patients with AD 26 but also between normal older adults without AD 272829.\nThis single-center, pre-post-intervention study aimed to determine whether the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts influences the spread of gamma rhythms induced by optimal FLS in cognitively normal older adults. It was hypothesized that the spread of gamma rhythms entrained in the sensory cortex to other brain regions will decrease as the white matter microstructural integrity connecting them decreases. By doing so, we sought to gain a clearer understanding of why gamma entrainment may benefit some individuals but not others, potentially leading to more targeted and effective therapeutics.",

      "text": "This study builds upon our previous work 14. Our previous study aimed to identify the optimal FLS parameters for entraining gamma rhythms in healthy older adults. In recent clinical trials, combined auditory and visual stimulation was employed for gamma entrainment 8,12,13 because it entrained gamma rhythms more widely than visual stimulation alone in preclinical studies. However, in the present study, visual Vol:. (1234567890) stimulation was employed instead of combined auditory and visual stimulation for the following reasons. Firstly, the objective of this study is not to ascertain which sensory stimuli are more efficacious at entraining gamma rhythms. Rather, it is to investigate the impact of white matter microstructural integrity on the propagation of entrained gamma rhythms. It is more advantageous to test our hypothesis if the region from which gamma rhythms are entrained is one than two in selecting target white matter tracts. Second, it seems clear that visual stimulation plays a pivotal role in gamma entrainment in preclinical studies. This is evidenced by the fact that auditory sensory stimulation alone is insufficient to entrain gamma rhythms 8,36,37. Third, our previous study demonstrated that visual stimulation alone, without combined auditory stimulation, effectively entrained gamma rhythms, including the temporal and frontal regions, when its parameters were optimized for older humans 14,38. Fourth, it may be the case that visual stimulation alone is more widely applicable in older adults, in whom hearing difficulty is prevalent, than combined visual and auditory stimulation 39. Finally, if the effectiveness is the same, it may be the case that using only visual stimulation would be cheaper and easier to use than using combined visual and auditory stimulation.\nWe conducted resting-state EEG (rsEEG) for 5 min prior to FLS. The FLS was administered in a randomized order with one of the four types (400 cdm 2 white light, 700 cdm 2 white light, 400 cdm 2 red light, and 700 cdm 2 red light) in each experimental session. The apparatus consisted of a pair of white organic light-emitting diode panels (4.7 cm  4.7 cm; color temperature 3000 K; LG Display Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) attached to a pair of glasses. The steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) of gamma rhythms were measured for 4000 ms from 1000 ms before FLS onset to 1000 ms after FLS offset.\nAlthough the precise mechanisms remain unclear, it is evident that higher levels of light intensity lead to stronger gamma entrainment in response to flickering light stimuli. Previous studies have employed light intensities within the range of 130 to 1400 cdm 2 , with higher intensities demonstrating the capacity to entrain stronger gamma rhythms 11-13, 15, 16. Our previous studies examined and compared the strength of gamma entrainment and gamma propagation based on light intensity of 10, 100, 400, and 700 cdm 2 14,38. The results indicated that the highest light intensity, 700 cdm 2 , was the most optimal for stronger gamma entrainment and propagation.\nPrevious studies have employed a single frequency, 40 Hz, for the stimulation of flickering light 111213. However, it is possible that the optimal gamma entrainment frequency may differ between humans and mice. Consequently, our previous study investigated gamma entrainment and propagation based on a frequency range of 32  50 Hz 38. For older adults, the low gamma frequency of 32 Hz entrained and propagated the gamma frequency the most 14.\nThe administration of the FLS has demonstrated that among the light colors, blue, green, red, and white, white and red induce gamma brain rhythms the strongest, with white having fewer side effects than red 38. Consequently, in this study, we utilized SSVEP and sGC of gamma rhythms entrained by a 32 Hz white FLS of 700 cdm 2 , as this had optimally entrained and propagated gamma rhythms in older adults 14. Further details of the FLS administration are provided in our previous study 14.\nRecording, preprocessing, and analysis of EEG EEG was recorded using 64 Ag-AgCl electrodes on elastic caps (Easycap, EASYCAP GmbH, Munich, Germany) according to the extended International 10-20 System. FCz was used as the reference electrode. The forehead was used as the ground electrode and a pair of electrodes was placed above and below the left eye to record the EEG. The electrodes were kept at an impedance  10 kΩ throughout the recording period. A 24-bit ActiCHamp DC amplifier and BrainVision Recorder (Brain Products GmbH, Gliching, Germany) were used to amplify and store the EEG signal. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. No online filters were used in the EEG recordings. Stimulus markers were provided by the FLS control system and synchronized with the rsEEG recording.\nWe preprocessed and analyzed the data using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), EEGLAB 40, and the BSMART 41 toolbox. We filtered the recorded signals using a 1-Hz high-pass finite impulse response filter and a 60-Hz notch filter, and then applied them to a common mean reference.",

      "text": "We performed an independent component analysis to remove eye blinks and other ocular artifacts from the EEG signals. After preprocessing, we segmented the 5-min rsEEG recordings into 1500-ms epochs and then randomly selected 20 artifact-free epochs from them. We obtained a 4000-ms epoch from 1000 ms before FLS onset to 1000 ms after FLS offset, resulting in 204,000-ms epochs of optimal FLS. For the sGC analysis, we obtained 1500 ms from 501 to 2000 ms from each 4000-ms epoch.\nWe defined the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the ratio of the SSVEP power at the stimulus frequency to the mean power of the background noise from 1 to 60 Hz from 501 to 2000 ms after FLS onset in a logarithmic scale 42, and considered data with less than 1.5 SNR at one or more occipital lobe electrodes (POz, Oz, O1, and O2) as SSVEP deficit due to failed gamma training.\nWe analyzed the FLS-induced EEG spectral power change using event-related spectral perturbation in each block. We calculated the time-frequency spectrum of each epoch and normalized the spectrum by dividing the mean power of the pre-stimulus intervals. We calculated the ratio of the EEGs spectral power during the FLS to that during the pre-FLS interval of each FLS. We then calculated the eventrelated desynchronizationsynchronization (ERD ERS) value by averaging the EEG spectral power ratios for a given optimal FLS from 20 FLS trials to obtain a normalized, averaged FLS-induced spectral power change. We used the ERS to measure the strength of FLS-entrained gamma rhythms and used the average ERS from a 501-ms stimulus onset to a 2000-ms stimulus onset, which was when a gamma rhythm was continuously and strongly entrained, in the analyses of gamma entrainment.\nTo investigate whether gamma rhythms entrained in the visual cortex propagate to other brain regions, we compared the sGCs during FLS with those at resting state. We calculated the sGCs for all possible electrode pairs and averaged each FLS frequency for each session. We set the time lags for 75 samples to calculate sGC 43. We compared the mean sGC of the 20 1500-ms epochs from rsEEG to that of the 20 1500-ms epochs from SSVEP during FLS. Since the EEG of each FLS condition had different pairs of significant connections between electrodes, we used graph theory measures to quantitatively compare the network structures between FLS intensities, colors, and frequencies 44,45. We compared the number of edges where the sGCs of occipital to frontal or temporocentral connections significantly increased after FLS compared with rsEEG. We examined the propagation of entrainment with sGC by designating the following regions: occipital (POz, Oz, O1, O2), left temporocentral (FT7, T7, TP7, TP9, FC5, FC3, C5, C3, CP5, CP3), right temporocentral (FT8, T8, TP8, TP10, FC4, FC6, C4, C6, CP4, CP6), left frontal (AF7, AF3, F7, F5, F7, F5, FC5, FC3), right frontal (AF4, AF8, F6, F8, F6, F8, FC4, FC6) 464748. Using these regions, we calculated the connectivity from the occipital to the temporocentral or frontal regions. We then selected Oz as a representative channel of the occipital region to investigate the association between the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts and entrainment, as Oz is considered a direct entrainment signal from the occipital region 49,50.\nAcquisition, preprocessing, and analysis of DTI Diffusion tensor image (DTI) was performed using a 3.0-Tesla Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems; Eindhoven, NL). We used a DTI DwiSE sequence (echo time  49 ms; repetition time  5165 ms; axial plane acquisition matrix size  112  112 mm; slice thickness  2 mm; acquired voxel size  2.00  2.00  2.00 mm; and flip angle  90) and acquired a baseline image (b  0) and 14 different diffusion orientations with a b-value of 1000-smm 2 .\nWe then performed DTI parameter acquisition using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL 6.0, https: fsl. fmrib. ox. ac. uk fsl fslwi ki) 51 to capture the microstructural integrity of the white matter tracts of interest. First, we converted DTI Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine volumes to NIfTI format and extracted the brain using the bet function and the baseline image using the fslroi function on FSL. We then corrected for inhomogeneity using the eddy current function to remove distortion and motion. We generated DTI metric maps for each subject using the dtifit function on FSL: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AxD). FA is calculated from each of the eigenvalues that represent the degree of anisotropy of the water molecules 52,53. MD represents the overall degree of diffusion, and is calculated as the average of three eigenvalues 52,54. RD represents the degree of water diffusion diffusing Vol:. (1234567890) perpendicular to the tract, indicated by the average of the two smaller eigenvalues, and AxD represents the average diffusion coefficient of water molecules diffusing parallel to the tract at each voxel, indicated by the largest of the three eigenvalues 55,56. We registered each participants FA map in the FMRIB58 standard space 57,58 and used this transformation to register each participants DTI maps, defined in this standard space back into each participants space.\nUsing the FSL atlas tool, we defined four white matter tracts of interest that may play a key role in gamma rhythm entrainment and propagation from occipital to temporal and frontal regions that are known to be affected by AD 59,60. We chose XTRACT HCP tract atlases as it covers the tracts that we aimed to analyze, and provides robust data quality for human subjects 61. We defined the left and right middle longitudinal fasciculi (l-MLF and r-MLF), which are distributed from the occipital area to the temporocentral area, and the left and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (l-IFO and r-IFO), which are distributed from the occipital area to the frontal area (Fig. 1). Using the FSL atlas tool, we defined four white matter tracts of interest that may have no association with the gamma rhythm entrainment and propagation from occipital to temporal and frontal regions that are known to be affected by AD. We defined the left and right uncinate fasciculi (l-UF and r-UF), which are distributed from the temporal lobe and frontal lobe, and the left and right vertical occipital fasciculi (l-VOF and r-VOF), which are distributed from the dorsolateral and ventrolateral visual cortex (Supplementary Fig. 1) 61. To minimize the partial volume effect, we obtained a mean skeleton mask by performing tract-based spatial statistics on the FA maps of all participants using the FSL 6.0 (FMRIB Software Library, https: fsl. fmrib. ox. ac. uk fsl fslwi ki) 51. First, the FA maps of all subjects were registered to the FMRIB58 template and transformed to MNI 152 space. Following this process, a mean FA map was generated, which served as the basis for the construction of the mean skeleton mask. After constructing the mean skeleton mask, we extracted only the overlapping regions by superimposing our extracted ROIs on the mean skeleton mask, with a 20 probability threshold applied to each ROI. We then acquired the mean FA, MD, RD, and AxD values within each ROI.",

      "text": "Of the 31 participants, 26 were included in the final analysis after excluding 5 participants who had an SSVEP deficit. The mean SNR of the excluded participants was below 0 (-3.33  2.59), indicating that gamma rhythms were not entrained. All the excluded participants were male. Age, education level, MMSE score, GDS score, and FA, MD, RD, and AxD of MLFs and IFOs were comparable between the included and excluded participants (Table 1).\nThere was no significant correlation between participant characteristics such as age, sex, education, MMSE, and GDS and the ERS OZ or sGCs of gamma rhythm connectivity from the occipital to temporocentral and frontal cortices (p  0.05, Supplementary Table 1). In the multiple linear regression analyses, the sGCs of gamma rhythm connectivity from the occipital to the temporocentral regions increased with increasing ERS Oz and FA of MLF while decreasing MD, RD, and AxD of MLF in both hemispheres (Fig. 2). The sGCs of gamma rhythm connectivity from the occipital to the frontal regions also increased with increasing ERS Oz and FA of IFO while decreasing MD, RD, and AxD of IFO in both hemispheres (Fig. 3).\nIn the forward stepwise multiple linear regression analyses for MLF and IFO (Table 2), ERS Oz was identified as a significant predictor of sGCs of gamma connectivity from occipital to the temporocentral and the frontal regions in all models (p  0.001), suggesting that the strength of gamma entrainment in visual cortex may be a prerequisite for gamma rhythms to propagate adequately to other brain regions. The study also identified several metrics of WM microstructural integrity (FA, MD, RD, and AxD of MLF and IFO in both hemispheres) as significant predictors of sGCs of gamma connectivity from occipital to the temporocentral and the frontal regions in all models (p  0.05), except AxD of right MLF and IFO and MD of right MLF. This suggests that, despite the robust entrainment of gamma rhythms in the visual cortex, their propagation to other regions may be impaired if the microstructural integrity of the WM tracts connecting the visual cortex to other areas is compromised. The adjusted R 2 value, representing the percentage of fluctuation in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s), varied from 0.718 to 0.870 across models. Of these, the adjusted R 2 increased by approximately 4.0  12.0 across the models (Δ adjusted R 2  0.033  0.091), representing how much the microstructural integrity of the WM has enhanced the fit of the model. This indicates that, regardless of the initial strength of the gamma rhythm entrainment in the visual cortex, WM microstructural integrity plays a significant role in explaining the variation in the strength of gamma connectivity from the occipital region to other parts of the brain.\nIn the forward stepwise multiple linear regression analyses for UF and VOF (Supplementary Tables 2 and3), ERS Oz was identified as a significant predictor of sGCs of gamma connectivity from occipital to the temporocentral and the frontal regions in all models (p  0.001).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study reveals that even if gamma rhythms are successfully entrained in the visual cortex with optimal conditions measured by previous studies, which are found to be white-colored 700 cdm 2 with 32 Hz, these rhythms may not adequately propagate to other target regions if the microstructural integrity of the WM tracts connecting the visual cortex to these regions is not intact. This was found to be the case for both MLF and IFO in both hemispheres. However, given that damage to WM microstructural integrity is common in older adults 272829 and in patients with Alzheimers disease 26, WM microstructural integrity should be considered as a potential criterion in identifying appropriate candidates for the administration of gamma entrainment as a therapeutic or preventive intervention against Alzheimers disease.\nIn previous research, a decrease in the powers of resting and evoked beta and gamma waves was found during the early stages of AD 626364656667686970. Notably, in AD-modeled mice, entrained gamma waves demonstrated the ability to clear AD pathologies and improve cognitive function, whereas entrained alpha, beta, and high gamma waves did not significantly influence amyloid beta accumulation or cognitive function 7,717273. Moreover, alpha and beta waves, when entrained, were not effectively propagated to other target brain regions 747576. While the correlation between resting gamma powersynchrony in healthy older adults and cognitive tests remains uncertain, in AD patients, gamma wave power exhibited strong correlations with the level of AD pathologies and cognitive test scores 77787980. Consistent with these findings, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score showed an association with the relative power of resting gamma waves but not with other frequency bands. This suggests that the decline in resting gamma power may contribute to decreased cognitive function in AD, and restoring gamma waves could potentially improve cognitive function by directly clearing AD pathologies. Resting low gamma band power in the frontal to parietal region appears to be particularly associated with higher-order cognitive functions 81828384. Interestingly, in cognitively normal older adults with amyloid beta levels below a certain threshold, the relative power of resting gamma waves increases with advancing age, showing a negative correlation with the MMSE score in the current study. However, in AD patients, the power and or synchrony of gamma waves in response to external stimuli decreases with increasing amyloid beta deposition 2,3,13,77,78,85,86. These findings show the importance of gamma wave entrainment as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD, given its efficacy in clearing AD pathologies and its correlation with cognitive function, distinct from other frequency bands.\nBoth the propagation and the resting coherence of gamma rhythms have been observed to be negatively affected by the WM microstructural integrity 212223242566. The microstructural integrity of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital white matter not only shows age-related deterioration 272829 but is also frequently compromised in Alzheimers disease patients 26272829. This deterioration is often accompanied by a decrease in EEG power or synchronization 21,22,24. However, none of the previous preliminary studies investigating the effect of gamma entrainment in patients with Alzheimers disease considered WM microstructural integrity in participant selection or outcome analysis 111213. Therefore, to underline the critical role of WM microstructural integrity in gamma entrainment using FLS, this study is the first to directly demonstrate the effect of WM microstructural integrity on gamma rhythm propagation. Although WM microstructural integrity accounted for 4.0  12.0 of the total variances in the strength of gamma rhythm connectivity in healthy younger older adults participating in the current study, its impact may be greater in the patients with Alzheimers disease who have more severe impairments in WM microstructural integrity than healthy older adults.\nWe used four distinct indicators of WM microstructural integrity to delineate structural integrity and investigate its specific structural significance in gamma rhythm propagation. Typically, FA is considered to represent overall neuronal microstructural integrity, MD to be indicative of membrane density, RD to reflect axon myelination, and AxD to indicate axonal injury 87. Each of these individual WM microstructural integrity indicators showed a significant association with the strength of gamma rhythm connectivity represented by sGC. This aligns with previous studies, which also showed an association between poor microstructural integrity and diminished gamma rhythm functional connectivity 88,89. As such, all the WM microstructural integrity metrics we investigated could potentially be used to screen suitable candidates for gamma entrainment using FLS as a therapeutic or preventive intervention.\nOf all the WM microstructural integrity metrics, RD was explained in all the multiple linear regression models, indicating a significant association with sGC in all the WM tracts. In contrast, AxD had the fewest number of models to explain a significant association with sGC of WM tracts examined. It is possible that the difference in the number of explained models may be due to the characteristics of our participants. The relationship between AxD and brain health has been a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting a link to 909192. Additionally, AxD has been shown to be affected primarily in the later stages of Alzheimers disease (AD) 93. Given that our participants were cognitively healthy, this may have contributed to the limited number of explanatory models for AxD. On the other hand, RD, which is potentially linked to axonal myelination 94,95, may be a more accurate indicator of white matter integrity for gamma rhythm propagation. This may have reflected the underlying mechanism of propagation. Some studies have postulated that differences in axonal myelination can modulate the speed of signal transmission, allowing synaptic signals to sum even at different distances between distant neurons 96,97. It is postulated that more distant neurons may have increased myelination for faster conduction speed. Conversely, neurons in closer proximity may exhibit less myelination to match the conduction speed of neurons in more distant locations 98,99. This suggests that the propagation of signals between brain regions may be more closely associated with axonal myelination, and consequently, with RD. It is also worth noting that FA and MD (representing structural integrity and membrane density, respectively) are related to axonal myelination, which may help to explain their strong association with the strength of gamma rhythm connectivity. While the MD for the right MLF model was not significant on sGC, it did show a marginal significance (p  0.055). It is also interesting to note that the model for the right MLF and IFO seems to also have fewer explained models than the left models. This could be attributed to the fact that the right MLF and IFO are denser than the left MLF and IFO 100. Given that our participants are cognitively normal, it is possible that their MLF and IFO have not deteriorated to the extent that they affect the propagation of gamma rhythms. This could have resulted in a reduction in the statistical power for the model, which suggests that there may be a threshold for WM microstructural integrity to affect gamma propagation. We also do recognize that there may be numerous unknown variables that could have influenced the statistical result. To accurately examine the association between ERS Oz , event-related synchronization of the gamma rhythm at Oz of each hemisphere; FA, fractional anisotropy; MD, mean diffusivity; MLF, middle longitudinal fasciculus; RD, radial diffusivity; sGC, spectral Granger causality of gamma rhythm connectivity from occipital region to temporocentral region in each hemisphere.  Multiple linear regression analysis with ERS Oz and one of FA, MD, RD, or AxD of MLF as independent variables and sGC as a dependent variable in each hemisphere. The sGCs of gamma rhythm connectivity from the occipital to the temporocentral regions increased with increasing ERS Oz and FA of MLF while MD, RD, and AxD of MLF decreased in both hemispheres. This suggests gamma rhythm connectivity from the occipital to the temporocentral regions are not only influenced by gamma entrainment, but also influenced by the WM integrity of MLF  specific metrics of WM microstructural integrity and gamma rhythm propagation, further studies are needed that differentiate between these metrics and include more participants who are very old or have Alzheimers disease. Despite these considerations, our study was successful in demonstrating the influence of WM microstructural integrity on gamma rhythm propagation. Therefore, our study suggests that WM microstructural integrity may have potential for optimizing FLS parameters for older adults and for selecting appropriate candidates who may benefit from gamma entrainment using FLS.\nThe frontal and temporal regions, known to be affected by Alzheimers disease, are interconnected by long-distance gamma rhythms 101, necessitating the selection of white matter tracts forming these connections from the occipital region to illustrate the effect WM microstructural integrity on gamma rhythm propagation. Specifically, MLFs extend from the occipital to the temporocentral region 102 and IFOs project from the occipital to the frontal region 103. These tracts potentially influence the propagation of gamma rhythms entrained in the visual cortex to the temporocentral and frontal regions 101. On the contrary, while the WM microstructural integrity UF and VOF is expected to affect EEG as cross-fissural fascicles 104, they do not connect the occipital with temporal or frontal regions. The result of the linear regression model has shown that WM microstructural integrity of MLF and IFO was a significant predictor while that of UF and VOF was not a predictor for the gamma propagation between occipital and temporal or frontal regions. These results clearly demonstrated that the WM microstructural integrity of MLFs and IFOs was significantly associated with the strength of gamma rhythm connectivity between occipital and corresponding target brain regions. It seems plausible to suggest that the microstructural integrity of MLFs and IFOs may be beneficial for enabling the proper propagation of gamma rhythms entrained in the visual cortex to target brain areas in AD patients. Up to 35 of normal adults aged 18-55 years exhibit an SSVEP deficit within the gamma range 105. In this study, five out of 31 participants (16.1) were excluded from the analyses due to SSVEP deficit. Men tend to exhibit SSVEP deficit more than women 105,106, and in this study, all five excluded participants were men. Although impairment in WM microstructural integrity may increase the risk of SSVEP deficit 106, the values representing WM microstructural integrity were comparable between the included and the excluded participants across all white matter tracts in this study.\nThere is alternative sensory stimulation to entrain gamma rhythms such as an auditory stimulation or the combination with visual stimulation 8,12,13. However, auditory stimulation has shown limited efficacy in clearing AD pathology beyond the auditory cortex 8,36,37. In contrast, visual stimulation has demonstrated effectiveness in clearing Alzheimers pathology not only in the visual cortex but also in the frontal and temporal regions 9,72. Moreover, gamma waves induced by visual stimuli exhibit a longer duration compared to those induced by auditory stimuli 107. Additionally, the prevalence of senile deafness rises in adults over 70 years old 39, while central auditory processing disorders, affecting complex sound recognition, are more common in individuals with MCI 39,108,109. For multimodal stimulation, each modality could desynchronize the gamma entrainment of other modalities 60, which could lessen the efficacy of overall gamma entrainment. Consequently, visual stimuli have proven to be more effective and widely applicable for entraining gamma waves in older adults, particularly those with Alzheimers disease.\nThis study has several limitations. First, surface EEG changes may not accurately reflect those in the source signal due to volume conduction. Therefore, sGC differences between surface EEG electrodes may not be solely attributable to differences in the microstructural integrity of the corresponding WM tracts. Second, this study had limited statistical power because of the small sample size and the modest inter-individual differences in WM microstructural integrity in healthy older adults. Third, the observed relationships between the metrics of WM microstructural integrity and the sGC of gamma rhythm connectivity are correlational and not necessarily causal. Further research may be needed to determine the precise mechanisms by which WM microstructural integrity influences the propagation of gamma rhythms in the brain.\nOur study highlights the importance of considering the microstructural integrity of key white matter tracts when assessing the efficacy of gamma entrainment in Alzheimers disease patients in future clinical trials. While it remains critical to use an optimized FLS that can strongly entrain gamma rhythms in the visual cortex, the state of MW microstructural integrity should be considered in participant selection and outcome analysis. For individuals with severe impairments in WM microstructural integrity, direct gamma rhythm entrainment in target brain regions using other neuromodulation devices, such as transcutaneous electrical stimulation, may be considered. These findings expand our understanding of the requirements for effective gamma entrainment and have implications for the development of more effective therapeutic or preventive interventions for Alzheimers disease.\nAuthor contribution YP designed experiments, performed the experiments, ERS analyses, GC analysis, and FA analysis, and drafted the manuscript.

    "abstract": "compared with DTI findings. Compared with WT controls, gray matter (GM) areas in APPPS1 mice such as the cingulate cortex and the striatum showed significant fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (DA) increase, while the thalamus only showed a significant FA increase (p 0.01). Similarly, a significant mean diffusivity, DA, and radial diffusivity increase was observed in the bilateral neocortex (p 0.01). The left hippocampus only showed significant FA increase in APPPS1 mice (p0.01). The changes in WM regions were detected in the forceps minor of the corpus callosum, the anterior part of the anterior commissure, and the internal capsule, with a significant FA or DA increase (p 0.01). Abnormalities derived from diffusion measurements were in-line with the ultrastructure findings, including extensive pathological damage of the neurons, neutrophils, and vessels. In conclusion, voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging can detect diffusion alterations not only in GM but also in WM areas in AD models, reflecting the extensive pathological changes of AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) research has largely concentrated on the gray matter (GM) changes in the brain, but the white matter (WM) alterations secondary to the disruption of axons and myelin are of equal importance as well. Apart from the loss of pyramidal neurons in layers 1, increasing evidence also have showed dramatic changes in the axons and myelin in WM 2,3. However, the invasiveness of the pathology hinders comprehensive studies for spatial and temporal progression of AD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a well-established magnetic resonance imaging modality, is a feasible and noninvasive method to delineate water diffusion. DTI can provide information about tissue microstructures as well as its physiological state not contained in scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant 4. In DTI, the measured water diffusion is fitted to a simple tensor model with a 33 symmetrical matrix from which three eigenvalues (l 1 , l 2 , and l 3 ) and corresponding eigenvectors (ν 1 , ν 2 , and ν 3 ) can be computed 5. These primary parameters are usually combined into secondary parameters allowing for a simplified expression of water diffusion characteristics. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR) are the most commonly used ones, which are defined by the following equations:\nFA is usually used to evaluate the WM integrity and MD to evaluate the overall water diffusion in human brain studies 678. Recent work on animal models suggests that DA, which measures the water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts, and DR, which measures the water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fiber tracts, are both sensitive biomarkers to detect the pathophysiological changes in axons and myelin, respectively 91011121314. It has been suggested that a comprehensive analysis of diffusion measures would be sufficiently sensitive in studying the neurodegeneration disease rather than assuming a single metric. Therefore, we hypothesized that simultaneous use of different DTI parameters (FA, MD, DA, and DR) has the potential to infer microstructural changes in whole-brain tissues of AD, especially with the application of advanced imaging analysis methods.\nTo test our hypothesis, quantitative DTI analyses were performed on both transgenic AD model mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Accordingly, a voxel-based analysis method was applied to prevent the selection bias, and the changes across the whole brain were evaluated in amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPS1) mice.\nAfter DTI examination, an ultrastructure analysis was compared with DTI findings.",

      "text": "Experimental protocols were in strict accordance with the Guidance Suggestions for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals formulated by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Peoples Republic of China. Double transgenic mice strain name B6.Cg-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85DboJ that overexpress two AD-related proteins, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 1 were used in this study. Nine APPPS1 mice (13.751.52 months old) with age-dependent cerebral amyloid deposition and nine WT mice free of amyloid deposition (13.911.69 months old) were used. There was no age, gender, or weight difference between APPPS1 and WT mice (p0.835, 0.620, and 0.406, respectively). All the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10  chloral hydrate (5 mlkg) initially with 0.1-1.0  isoflurane (in pure O 2 ) for maintenance anesthesia.\nDiffusion tensor imaging was performed on a 7.0-T20cm Bruker Biospec scanner. A 72-mm-diameter volume coil was used for radio frequency pulse transmission and a fourchannel phase-array coil for signal detection. A multi-slice, echo-planar imaging sequence was employed for the acquisition of the required series of DTI, with repetition time (TR) of 4 s, echo time of 26 ms, field of view of 1.5 1.5 cm, matrix size of 128128, number of excitation of 4, slice thickness of 0.6 mm, and b value of 800 smm 2 . The total scan time was 37 min and 20 s.\nAfter the acquisition of raw data, all the DTI data were processed by the FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox within FSL (http:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwiki). The details of the processing procedure could be found in Supplementary Data 1. For the statistical analysis, an independent two-sample t test was used to compare the differences between APPPS1 mice and WT controls with a significant level of p0.01 (uncorrected, cluster size of 10) in each DTI-related measurement (FA, MD, DA, and DR).\nTo compare DTI findings with histology results, the neocortex and hippocampus were collected, while fresh (within 1 h after death) from APPPS1 mice (n2) and controls (n  2), and prepared for electron microscopy (EM). Briefly, specimens were fixed in 2.5  glutaraldehyde for 2 h followed by a second fixation in 1  osmium tetroxide for 30-120 min, dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, cleared in a mixture of acetone and epoxy (1:1) for 2 h, embedded in pure epoxy resin for 2 h, and finally aggregated in 80 C thermostat for 10 h. Ultrathin sections (90-100 nm) were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Germany), counterstained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and analyzed with a FEI Tecnai G212 (Dutch) transmission electron microscope.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "As shown in Fig. 1, APPPS1 mice exhibited higher FA values than controls in GM regions of the thalamus, striatum, and left hippocampus, as well as in WM regions of the forceps minor of the corpus callosum (fmi), the anterior part of the anterior commissure (aca), and the internal capsule (ic) (p0.01, uncorrected, cluster size of 10). The quantitative DTI parameters in the six brain regions are shown in Fig. 2. DA changes were much more similar to the FA alterations except for the thalamus, which showed no significant DA alterations (p0.01, uncorrected, cluster size of 10). For MD parametric statistics, only the bilateral neocortex exhibited higher MD values in APPPS1 mice (p0.01, uncorrected, cluster size of 10). Meanwhile, the bilateral neocortex also displayed elevated DA and DR (p 0.01, uncorrected, cluster size of 10). The quantitative DTI measurement in the neocortex could also be found in Fig. 2. Other brain regions not mentioned here showed no significant differences in any DTI parameters between APPPS1 mice and WT controls (p0.01, uncorrected, cluster size of 10).\nUltrastructure analysis showed pathological neurons as well as swollen neuronal processes in the neocortex and hippocampus of APPPS1 mice. Shrunken cytoplasm, irregular nuclei, polymorphic clumps of chromatin, and vacuolar mitochondria were identified in degenerating neurons (Fig. 3a). However, small amounts of disintegrating neurons were also detected in control mice. Heavy senile plaques were identified in APPPS1 mice (Fig. 3b). The abnormal cell processes in plaques most likely represented an origin from dystrophic axons with or without myelin sheaths. There were also some pathological changes in the vessels. In addition to amyloid deposits in the basal membrane of the blood vessels (stars in Fig. 3c), the perivascular space was significantly dilated in APPPS1 mice (the star in Fig. 3d). On closer observation, the enlarged perivascular spaces were most likely due to swelling of glial processes.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging study detected extensive diffusion alterations not only in GM but also in WM areas in APPPS1 mice, which reflected comprehensive pathological changes in animal models with AD. Voxelbased analysis (VBA) is a hypothesis-free method that Compared with WT controls, APPPS1 mice had higher FA value in GM areas such as the cingulate cortex, striatum, thalamus, and left hippocampus, as well as in WM areas such as fmi, aca, and ic. DA changes were in accordance with FA changes except in the thalamus, where significant FA increase, but no DA changes were found. The bilateral neocortex showed significant MD, DA, and DR increase. WT wild type, GM gray matter, WM white matter, fmi forceps minor of the corpus callosum, aca anterior part of anterior commissure, ic internal capsule compares imaging data between groups. Whole-brain-based VBA and DTI analyses were applied recently to various human studies in Kennedys disease 15, glaucoma 16, schizophrenia 17, etc. By combining multi-DTI parameters and a voxel-by-voxel whole-brain analysis method, the diffusion changes in the whole-brain regions were detected in APPPS1 mice. DTI abnormalities with significant FA or DA elevation in the APPPS1 mice group were localized to the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, striatum, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and internal capsule. Post-DTI ultrastructure analysis revealed extensive neuritic plaques, neuronal injury, as well as damage to axons and dendrites in the brains of APPPS1 mice. Our study indicated that the voxel-based DTI analysis was also applicable in the investigation of transgenic animal models, which may facilitate the anti-AD treatment monitoring. Neocortex laden with senile plaques in APPPS1 mice exhibited a significant increase in MD, DA, and DR values, but no obvious changes in FA values. The simultaneous elevation of DA and DR in the neocortex resulted in a significant increase in MD (MD equals the directionally averaged diffusion coefficient). MD elevation in the GM is thought to be linked to the extracellular space enlargement due to various cytoarchitectural alterations 18. Our study agreed with the study by Jack et al. 19, which demonstrated that APPPS1 mice exhibited a heavy plaque load in the neocortex and hippocampus at the age of 14-16 months. Therefore, age-dependent amyloidosis may be one possible reason leading to MD increment. Another reason may be the perivascular space dilation, as observed, which also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. It has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood flow in the brain 20. Swollen glial processes surrounding the vasculature destroyed the brain fluid dynamics and could have led to spongiosis changes in the brain. However, another study, using a single transgenic AD mouse model, reported an opposite result, which indicated a significant TR (a triple of MD) decrease in both the neocortex and hippocampus 14. The different animal models used in this study (double transgenic AD model) may be one possible reason to explain the inconsistencies. Specifically, the degree of GM and WM abnormalities differed appreciably among PDAPP 10, APPsw 14, and APPPS1 transgenic mice. At the same time, the disruption of either neurons or neutrophils, which was also observed in our ultrastructure studies, may explain the following diffusion changes: (1) neuronal loss resulted in a reduction of cell densities and facilitated the diffusion of water in the brain and (2) neuronal processes changes such as dystrophic dendrites as well as swollen axons broke the restriction barriers and made the diffusion of water much easier 21. Our suggestion was in agreement with Sun et al. 14 that, while the accumulation of amyloid plaques may contribute to the MD changes, it would not be the only contribution to the diffusion changes in the progression of AD.\nIn this study, the increase in the axial diffusion coefficient (DA) was also observed in WM areas of the forceps minor of the corpus callosum and the anterior part of the anterior commissure. One possible explanation is that Wallerian degeneration due to GM disorders may have occurred in these areas 21,22. Meanwhile, FA changes were in consistent with changes of the DA in most forebrain areas. The underlying pathobiological mechanism responsible for increased anisotropy in the forebrain is unknown. The crossing fibers in these regions may invalidate the simple tensor model used in this study. Rather, we suggested that our findings of an increased FA may contribute to the notion of dysfunction maturation, as several psychological studies have reported 23242526. It is well established that the FA value increases during the process of myelination. The increased FA in APPPS1 mice may reflect abnormal maturation of the forebrain WM fibers relative to WT controls. Several clinical studies have detected the abnormalities in deep GM structures 27,28, indicating that the limbic forebrain networks may have been disrupted in AD patients. The forebrain is the rostral-most portion of the brain. It facilitates the emotional processing and provides information for the phylogenetic part of the brain to regulate complex behaviors 29. Our study demonstrated extensive FA changes in the forebrain of APPPS1 mice relative to WT, indicating a disruption of the limbic forebrain network in AD rodents.\nIn conclusion, this voxel-based DTI study in vivo demonstrated extensive diffusion changes both in the GM and WM areas of APPPS1 mice compared with age-matched WT control mice. An explanatory histology study confirmed these changes. Based on VBA, we could simultaneously acquire multi-DTI measurements and get abundant information outside of our a priori knowledge. The voxel-based DTI method has the potential to detect pathological alterations in AD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel image-processing framework for tracking longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Charting the trajectory of such temporal changes offers new insight into disease progression but to do so accurately faces a number of challenges. Recent developments have highlighted the importance of processing each subjects data at multiple time points in an unbiased way. In this paper, we aim to highlight a different challenge critical to the processing of longitudinal DTI data, namely the approach to image alignment. Standard approaches in the literature align DTI data by registering the corresponding scalar-valued fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. We propose instead a DTI registration algorithm that leverages full tensor information to drive improved alignment. This proposed pipeline is evaluated against the standard FA-based approach using a DTI dataset from an ongoing study of Alzheimers disease (AD). The dataset consists of subjects scanned at two time points and at each time point the DTI acquisition consists of two back-to-back repeats in the same scanning session. The repeated scans allow us to evaluate the specificity of each pipeline, using a test-retest design, and assess precision, using bootstrap-based method. The results show that the tensor-based pipeline achieves both higher specificity and precision than the standard FA-based approach. Tensor-based registration for longitudinal processing of DTI data in clinical studies may be of particular value in studies assessing disease progression.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique offering sensitivity to tissue microstructure of white matter (WM) (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Pierpaoli et al., 1996). DTI is playing an increasingly important role in assessing white matter abnormalities in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD), vascular dementia (Hanyu et al., 1999;Sugihara et al., 2004), and frontotemporal dementia (Borroni et al., 2007;Matsuo et al., 2008). For example, in patients with AD, increased mean diffusivity (MD) andor reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) compared to healthy controls have been reported for several white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum, cingulum bundle and fornix (Bozzali et al., 2002;Choo et al., 2010;Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Mielke et al., 2009;Oishi et al., 2011;Rose et al., 2000;Sexton et al., 2010).\nMost DTI studies of neurodegenerative disorders have been crosssectional in nature. Few investigate the changes in DTI measures as a function of disease progression. One notable exception is a longitudinal study of AD by Mielke et al. (2009), which showed that FA in the fornix, cingulum, splenium, and cerebellar peduncle remained stable in AD and healthy elderly subjects over a three-month follow-up. In contrast to many cross-sectional studies, which employ voxel-based analysis, Mielke et al. adopt region-of-interest (ROI) based analysis to provide the sensitivity necessary for detecting subtle temporal changes in white matter over a very short period of time. This suggests that ROIbased analysis, which trades reduced spatial specificity for improved sensitivity, may be an effective approach for measuring DTI changes due to disease progression.\nThe effectiveness of ROI-based analysis is dictated by the accuracy and consistency of ROI delineation across subjects. To date, most studies of this kind define WM ROIs manually. Manual delineation utilises expert knowledge in anatomy to ensure the accuracy of ROI definition. However, this is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, it is also difficult to maintain a high-level of consistency for the entire dataset of a study, especially when placing the ROIs for small and thin tracts, such as the cingulum and the fornix, which are often plagued with partial volume effect with their surrounding anatomy. This becomes even more challenging for studies designed to track longitudinal changes. There is not only a need for between-subject consistency but also for within-subject between-scan consistency. This challenge motivates the present work.\nIn this paper, we propose an automated and unbiased DTI analysis pipeline for tracking longitudinal white matter changes. The pipeline aims to make ROI-based analysis both more accessible and more robust by combining best practices for unbiased longitudinal processing of structural imaging data (Reuter et al., 2012;Yushkevich et al., 2010) with recent advances in tensor-based image registration (Park et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2006). We evaluate the performance of the proposed pipeline using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of AD and compare it against the more common approach of using FA-based image registration (Ardekani et al., 2007;Jones et al., 2002;Smith et al., 2006).",

    "Overview of the pipeline": {
      "text": "The automated longitudinal processing pipeline is designed to enable a temporally unbiased evaluation of two time points where all time points of a subject are registered together to form a within-subject template. This is created in a mean space in order to avoid any interpolation asymmetry.\nInterpolation asymmetries could arise when resampling follow-up images to the baseline scan (Yushkevich et al., 2010), as only the follow-up images are smoothed while the baseline image is unaffected. Module A of Fig. 1 illustrates the generation of an unbiased withinsubject template for each subject in the study. The specific choice of registration method is discussed in the subsequent sections. The resulting template is unbiased towards any single time point. The original images, baseline and follow-up, are then transferred to this within-subject space and averaged. Module B of Fig. 1 demonstrates the creation of the group-wise (GW) atlas from the average images using iterative linear and non-linear registration methods. The mapping from the subject native space to its own within-subject template (warp field 1, W1, in Fig. 1) and the mapping from the within-subject template to the GW atlas (warp field 2, W2) were combined to create the deformation field that defines the mapping directly from the native space to the GW atlas.",

    "Choices of registration methods": {
      "text": "In this study, we propose that using a registration method that incorporates the entire tensor will provide more accurate and sensitive longitudinal measures than using FA based methods. For the tensor registration, we used a publicly available tool, DTI-TK,2 for spatial normalisation of DTI data (Zhang et al., 2006). We compared the effectiveness of this method to a widely used FA-based method: all the linear and non-linear registrations were performed using FSL (Smith et al., 2004), FLIRT, FMRIBs linear image registration tool (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) and FNIRT, FMRIBs Non-Linear Registration Tool (Andersson et al., 2007), with sum-of-squared differences as the cost function. Table 1 shows the detail of the unbiased longitudinal pipeline for each method.\nTensor-based pipeline. In the tensor-based registration pipeline, all linear and non-linear registrations were performed using DTI-TK on tensor images. By computing the image similarity on the basis of full tensor images rather than scalar features, the algorithm incorporates local fibre orientations as features that drive the alignment of individual WM tracts.\nFor each subject, a within-subject template was generated by computing the initial average template as a Log-Euclidean mean of the input DT images from the two time points. The Log-Euclidean tensor averaging preserves WM orientation with minimal blurring (Arsigny et al., 2006). The template was iteratively refined through the following steps: the DT images are registered to the template and a refined template is computed as an average of the registered DT images for the next iteration. The process is repeated until the change between templates from consecutive iterations becomes sufficiently small, first with affine and then with non-linear registrations (Zhang et al., 2007a(Zhang et al., , 2007c)). The Euclidean distance of tensors (overall distance between measures) is the metric used during the affine stage and the Euclidean distance of deviatoric tensors (difference between the anisotropic components of the tensors) is the metric used during the non-linear stage. The former metric was chosen for the affine registration as it is more stable over a larger capture range. Once a suitable affine alignment has been established, the latter metric provides a more accurate non-linear alignment between different white matter tracts (Zhang et al., 2006). Then a GW atlas is created from all of the average images in the within-subject space using the described iterative method. Maps of FA, MD, axial (DA) and radial (RD) diffusivity were created from the GW atlas and each registered tensor image in the GW atlas space. This pipeline will be referred to as the Tensor_GW method in this study.",

Two pipelines were designed to investigate the FA-based approach:\nGroup-wise FA (FA_GW): This pipeline is the same as the Tensor_GW method but the FA based image registration is used instead to create the within-subject template and GW atlas (Keihaninejad et al., 2012).  Half-way space FA (FA_HS): In order to do a comparison with established techniques, we applied the method proposed by Zatorre et al. (2012). For each subject, the FA maps of two time points were registered to a space mid-way between the spaces of two images using an affine transformation, and averaged. The generated templates were then non-linearly aligned to FMRIB58_FA in standard space and averaged to generate a study-specific template. The FA maps in the native space were then transformed to standard space by combining the linear transform to the half-way space with the transform from that half-way space to standard space.",

      "text": "To include the major WM tracts, the FA map of the GW atlas is segmented using the LoAd (Locally Adaptive) tool, which is part of the NiftySeg3 package (Cardoso et al., 2011). A binary mask was created using a threshold of 50 on the WM probability map in order to focus on areas that were likely to be predominantly WM.\nThe ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels and tract atlas, developed by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) was used to locate the WM tracts of interest (Mori et al., 2005). To be consistent and avoid bias toward the registration technique used in FLIRT and FNIRT, the FA map of the JHU atlas was linearly and non-linearly registered to the final template FA map using NiftyReg4 (Modat et al., 2010). This transformation was used to warp the labels from the WM atlas to the template FA image through nearest neighbour interpolation. In this study, we focused on six white matter ROIs: the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as the fornix and cingulum bundles (left and right). Each ROI was combined with the binary WM mask to remove voxels that did not contain sufficient white matter. An example of the ROIs overlaid onto an individual subject using the three methods can be found in Fig. 2. These are the most common white matter ROIs where the literature indicates a change in structures between those with AD and controls (Douaud et al., 2011;Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Rose et al., 2000). The fornix as the major outflow tract of the hippocampus is very relevant to AD as is the cingulum, since both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate are early sites of AD involvement (Scahill et al., 2002).",

In the TT-23 set, nonzero average changes that were significant were found using both the FA_GW and FA_HS methods for the body and splenium of the corpus callosum and the cingulum bundle.\nIt can be observed in Fig. 5 that the proposed processing stream based on tensor registration shows a much lower level of FA difference between the test-retest scan; the differences were not significantly different from zero for any of the ROIs. This suggests the tensor registration is more robust to bias between the first and second acquisitions than either the FA_HS or FA_GW pipelines.\nThe test-retest reliability, in terms of ICCs between repeated scans is shown in Table 3. The ICC value is greater than 0.99 for all the white matter ROIs when using Tensor_GW.",

For MD, the change was significantly different between AD and controls for the genu, body and fornix. The annualised change of axial diffusivity was significantly different between the two groups for the genu and body of corpus callosum, while significant differences in annualised change of radial diffusivity was observed in the genu, body and fornix. FA_HS and FA_GW methods showed higher variation in the annualised change of FA in both groups compared to Tensor_GW. FA_HS showed no significant difference on annualised change of FA between AD and controls but in MD of the genu, body, splenium and fornix. FA_GW showed significant difference for the annualised change of FA in the splenium and left cingulum and in MD for the body of corpus callosum.\nFig. 6 shows plots of percent change averages (and standard errors). Higher ability to distinguish the AD from the normal control group based on the percent FA change can be seen mainly in the genu, body and cingulum bundle when using Tensor_GW.\nFigs. 7 and8 show the variability of longitudinal change of FA as percent change in LS-23 when different scan combinations of baseline and follow-up are studied using different longitudinal approaches. The results of the performed paired t-test between 4 scan combinations, 6 possible pairs of comparison, are shown in inset 44 matrix for each structure and each method. Each 44 matrix indicates the combinations that showed statistically significant difference with other combinations. The lower triangle of the 44 matrix indicates which of these 6 combinations was significant for AD, the upper triangle for controls. The significant result (pb 0.05) is coloured for each group, AD in green, controls in yellow and blank shows there is no significant difference in the paired t-test. Diagonals are colour coded red as combinations are not tested against themselves and also to serve as a boundary between AD and controls.\nFigs. 7 and8 show that the Tensor_GW approach results in the same FA longitudinal change in the controls and AD group regardless of which scan combinations are used, which confirms the robustness of this pipeline. For the Tensor_GW, the only significant difference was found between B1-F2 and F1-B2 on the splenium of corpus callosum. FA_HS shows the most biased results when using different scan combinations for both groups and all the ROIs except the fornix. FA_GW shows the same pattern of bias but less than FA_HS.",

      "text": "As mentioned above, the unbiased longitudinal DTI pipeline avoids interpolation asymmetry induced bias by treating all time points equivalently. Another source of processing bias can be due to the registration of the scalar features.\nAs a dimensionless measure of change we compute the percent change (PC) of the FA of a ROI with respect to the average FA defined as:\nwhere FA i is the FA of scan i, where i could either be referring to first or second acquisition in the case of TT-23 or the first or second time point in the case of LS-23.\nTo quantify test-retest reliability we used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) measure of FA (Bartlett and Frost, 2008). The ICC value quantifies the consistency and reliability of the repeated scans.\nThe annualised rate of change in DTI metrics was computed as the DTI parameter value of the follow-up scan minus that of baseline scan divided by the duration between the two scans (in years). To compare the annualised rate of change between AD cases and controls, the linear regression model was used adjusting for baseline age and gender.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, two back-to-back scans were acquired at each time point. The longitudinal percentage FA change can be computed between the 4 possible combinations of the back-to-back scans: 1: B1-F1; 2: B1-F2; 3: B2-F1; and 4: B2-F2. In order to identify potential bias or variability in the change measurement between any of these scan combinations, we took the difference between the change measurements coming from these 4 scan combinations to generate 6 pairs of difference measurements (i.e. 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, and 3-4). We performed paired t-tests between the 6 difference measurements to determine if the percentage FA change was significantly different between these 6 difference measurements (pb 0.05).\nIn the cross-sectional analysis of the baseline scans, linear regression models were used to assess differences in DTI metrics of white matter tracts between patients and controls adjusting for age and gender.

It is clear that there are within-subject misregistrations in the corpus callosum region that are most apparent when using the FA_HS method. In the FA_HS method, only a linear registration method is used, which is incapable of recovering non-linear changes that occur between visits. These changes could not only be due to atrophy, but also due to changes in positioning and head orientation between visits. For the inter subject registration, the group wise atlas resulting from the TENSOR_GW technique provides more clearly delineated white matter anatomy than the two methods based on FA. When using all of the tensor information, the registration technique can align between subjects the boundaries of two adjacent tracts that have similar FA but different orientation. Once the information is compressed into a non-directional metric like FA, there is no longer the ability to resolve this information.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The creation of a robust within-subject template yields an initial unbiased estimate of the location of anatomical structures for a longitudinal scheme. Our approach of treating all time points the same removes interpolation asymmetry induced processing bias. The tensor based registration method using DTI-TK provided significant improvements to the unbiased longitudinal pipeline that reduced bias in the specificity experiments but also increased the ability to detect real change in the sensitivity experiments. The motivation for using diffusion-tensor data to drive the registration is that the orientational information potentially provides powerful features for matching. Using full-tensor information as a similarity metric for non-linear warping has been shown to be effective in spatially normalising tract morphology and tensor orientation (Park et al., 2003;Wang et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2006).\nIn the specificity experiment, the Tensor-GW method was the only one of three to show no significant FA change between two repeated scans. It also improves the reliability measured by ICC. However, there is potential bias occurring in the test-retest experiment due to several kinds of artefacts, including head motion artefact, bed vibration artefact, etc. Although no correction for multiple comparisons (due to the multiple ROIs) has been performed, the main goal of these values is only to demonstrate that a clear trend exists concerning",

      "text": "The reliability of the repeated scans analysed with three methods is measured using the ICC. the specificity of each of the techniques that we evaluate. Our results with the tensor-based technique are supported by the findings of Pfefferbaum et al. (2003), where they evaluated within-scanner and between-scanner reliability of FA in 10 subjects who had three scans on two different scanners. Using a voxel-by-voxel analysis of all supratentorial brain (gray matter  white matter  cerebrospinal fluid) and a single-region analysis of the corpus callosum, they found that FA correlation was equivalently and significantly higher within than across scanners. Despite a growing interest in the use of DTI to characterise neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, there have been relatively few studies looking at longitudinal changes in white matter integrity in the presence of AD or other degenerative diseases (Mielke et al., 2009;Teipel et al., 2010). Mielke et al. studied the FA and MD changes over 2.5 years in the fornix and cingulum bundle and their correlation to hippocampal volume and memory decline (Mielke et al., 2012) using the same manual delineation protocol used in Mielke et al. (2009). With the previously used ROI-based methods as utilised in Mielke et al. (2009), it is difficult to objectively and reproducibly place ROIs on small or thin tracts on the images of individual patients, when the slice orientation and anatomical details (such as atrophy) may show variation between individuals at two or more time points and when the boundaries of the white matter tracts are not easily identified. There is also variability arising between different time points when creating a half-way or group-wise space based on FA images because of some misalignment.",

Second, non-linear within-subject registration can deal with the atrophy that may occur between time points in a longitudinal study. Third, creating an inter-subject group-wise atlas eliminates the potential for bias when spatially normalising elderly controls and AD patients, compared to a standard template of adult subjects such as FMRIB58_FA.\nWe show this third benefit for voxel-based analyses in a recent study (Keihaninejad et al., 2012) that uses a method nearly identical to the FA_GW method. In this study, we further illustrate, through the sensitivity and specificity experiments, that the unbiased longitudinal pipeline using tensor information significantly improves precision of studying longitudinal change based on DTI. In this study, we focussed on using ROI based measures such as the ones used by Mielke et al. (2012) to provide similar quantitative measures to those that are currently in the literature and have potential utility in the clinic. In future work we hope to apply the Tensor_GW method to voxel-based techniques, such as TBSS, to see if it can improve the results that were obtained using FA_GW. Further, we studied different scan combinations on longitudinal change of FA when either first acquisition or second one is employed as the longitudinal dataset. Both FA-based approaches showed significant differences in the change of key DTI metrics, such as FA, based on different scan combinations. One scan in the visit should not provide any systematically different results from another. The tensor-based approach showed the fewest significant differences between different baseline and follow-up scan combinations for the WM ROIs. Only the splenium of the corpus callosum was significantly different between B1-F2 and B2-F1. This difference was in the same direction as the significant differences for FA_HS and FA_GW in the test-retest experiments, suggesting a small bias between the first and second diffusion acquisitions which the tensor registration is more reliably able to reject.\nThe cross-sectional experiment demonstrated significant differences in fiber tract integrity (as measured by FA) in AD vs. controls in the genu of the corpus callosum, fornix and the cingulum bundle bilaterally. Whilst a reduced FA andor an increased MD in the corpus callosum is one of the most consistent findings in AD (Douaud et al., 2011;Liu et al., 2011), there has been conflicting evidence about whether the genu (Head et al., 2004;Xie et al., 2006) or the splenium (Rose et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002) shows the greatest neuropathological change. These conflicting results may be due to differences in the selection of patient populations. In our study, we found a decrease in FA in the genu accompanied by an increase of MD in the genu, body and splenium. The reduced FA in the bilateral cingulum is consistent with other studies (Catheline et al., 2010;Ding et al., 2008;Kiuchi et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2009;Nakata et al., 2008;Takahashi et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2007b). The increases of MD in the corpus callosum, fornix and cingulum were also supported by other research (Agosta et al., 2011;Douaud et al., 2011;Duan et al., 2006). In the event of concomitant (but not quite significant) increases in both axial and radial diffusivity, MD provides a pooled measure that may be statistically more sensitive than either of the individual component measures.\nOur dataset in this study was limited to two time points. The proposed unbiased longitudinal processing based on the tensor information can however be extended to evaluate scans that have been collected at more than two time points. The regions of interest which showed a significant change in diffusivity metrics over one year (namely the fornix, left cingulum and genu and body of corpus callosum) in the AD patients were all already significantly different from controls at baseline. It therefore seems that the particularly vulnerable white matter tracts in AD show evidence of progression of pathology over a one year interval, even in established disease. Investigation of the pattern of change in DTI metrics at multiple different stages during the course of AD will be an important direction for future research. Another area will be the investigation into the involvement of other white matter tracts, such as the uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculus. The patients in this study were all below the age of 72, representing a relatively young AD cohort. This reflects the referral pattern to the Cognitive Disorders Clinic from which they were recruited; as a tertiary centre run by neurologists, a high proportion of the patients referred to the clinic have early onset dementia. The benefit of studying a relatively young cohort is that they have fewer co-morbidities and it is therefore more likely that the imaging changes observed are secondary to AD rather than other or mixed pathologies such as vascular disease. However, it will be important for future studies to address whether our findings are generalisable to more elderly cohorts of AD patients. Although our linear regression models accounted for age and gender, the gender imbalance between the groups in the specificity and sensitivity experiments should be considered a limitation of the study.\nAlthough we used WM tissue segmentation to measure the DTI parameters, there is still the risk of partial volume effects and CSF contamination in thin structures like the fornix. Future work should include strategies to correct for CSF-contamination, for example correcting on a voxel-wise basis using the Free Water Elimination (FWE) approach (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012;Pasternak et al., 2009).\nThere is an increasing need to develop biomarkers that reflect neural changes at the earliest stages of the disease in order to select appropriate individuals for trials of disease modifying therapies and, potentially, to look for therapeutic effects. With the design of a number of presymptomatic prevention trials for AD now underway (Bateman et al., 2011;Reiman et al., 2010), this issue is particularly timely. Whilst most studies in neurodegenerative disorders have historically focussed on grey matter, it is becoming clearer that white matter involvement occurs early on in the disease process, and DTI provides an opportunity to measure these changes. Measure of within-subject longitudinal change may be more sensitive biomarkers of neurodegeneration compared to cross-sectional measures of a population. Thus, we have developed a method for the longitudinal study of DTI data in order to determine which white matter tracts become most affected by AD pathology over time with greater confidence.",

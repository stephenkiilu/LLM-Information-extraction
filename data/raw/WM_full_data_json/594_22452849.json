    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have observed microstructural abnormalities in white matter regions in both Alzheimers disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this work was to examine the abnormalities in white matter and subcortical regions of MCI and its subtypes in a large, community-dwelling older aged cohort Methods: A community-based sample of 396 individuals without dementia underwent medical assessment, neuropsychiatric testing, and neuroimaging. Of these, 158 subjects were classified as MCI and 238 as cognitively normal (controls) based on international MCI consensus criteria. Regional fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures were calculated from the DTI and compared between groups. The false discovery rate correction was applied for multiple testing. Results: Subjects with MCI did not have significant differences in FA compared with controls after correction for multiple testing, but had increased MD in the right putamen, right anterior limb of the internal capsule, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and right and left corona radiata. When compared with controls, changes in left anterior cingulate, left superior frontal gyrus, and right corona radiata were associated with amnestic MCI (aMCI), whereas changes in the right putamen, right anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the right corona radiata were associated with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). On logistic regression, the FA values in the left superior gyrus and MD values in the anterior cingulate distinguished aMCI from naMCI. Conclusions: MCI is associated with changes in white matter and subcortical regions as seen on DTI. Changes in some anterior brain regions distinguish aMCI from naMCI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a predementia syndrome characterized by cognitive decline greater than normal for age, but which does not significantly impair daily functioning (Winblad et al., 2004;Petersen et al., 2009). Individuals with MCI progress to dementia at a rate of about 6-15 per year, compared to about 1-2 per year Previous neuroimaging studies have examined the differences in brain volume and white matter lesion load between different MCI subtypes and healthy controls. Atrophy has been observed in parietal and temporal lobes, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus in aMCI (Whitwell et al., 2007;He et al., 2009;van de Pol et al., 2009). In naMCI, atrophy has been seen in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe, and basal forebrain (Whitwell et al., 2007). Reports on associations between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and subtypes have been conflicting. Higher WMH load has been more strongly associated with aMCI in one report (Luchsinger et al., 2009) and naMCI in another (Mariani et al., 2007a). Individuals with naMCI have been found to have greater levels of cortical infarction (Kantarci et al., 2008;Luchsinger et al., 2009).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures both the magnitude and direction of diffusion in tissue and can provide information about cerebral microstructural integrity. Two commonly used DTI parameters are: mean diffusivity (MD), a measure of the water motility in tissue, and fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of the restriction of diffusion to one direction. Damage to brain tissue is generally accompanied by increased MD and decreased FA. Many recent studies using DTI have found changes in a range of regions including the frontal, temporal, and parietal white matter, anterior and posterior cingulate, fornix, hippocampal formation, and splenium of the corpus callosum in MCI (Fellgiebel et al., 2004;2005;Medina et al., 2006;Huang et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2007;Shim et al., 2008;Lee et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2009). These studies have, however, used small sample sizes, ranging from 12 to 168 subjects, and have only compared aMCI patients with normal controls.\nOur objectives were to examine the diffusion tensor imaging changes in MCI in a large community-based older aged cohort, and to investigate the characteristics of amnestic and nonamnestic MCI subtypes using DTI. Identifying changes in MCI subtypes is the first step to evaluating the predictive capacity of DTI, which, in turn, may assist in easy and early identification of those at risk of dementia and predict the progression to Alzheimers disease and other dementias.",

      "text": "The study sample was drawn from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, a population-based longitudinal study investigating neurocognitive disorders in the older population (Sachdev et al., 2010). The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University of New South Wales and the South-Eastern Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service -Northern Sector, Sydney, Australia.\nCommunity-dwelling persons aged 70-90 years were randomly selected from the electoral roll from two local government areas in Eastern Sydney and sent a letter inviting them to participate in the study. Participants were recruited and examined between September 2005 and November 2007. Of the 8,914 invited, 1,772 people who accepted were screened via a telephone interview. Those people living in the community, with adequate knowledge of English to complete the neuropsychological assessment, were included in the study. Ideally, each participant would have an informant who had at least 1 hour contact per week and was capable of answering questions about the participants memory and daily activities. Participants were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, developmental disability, progressive cancer, or other medical or psychological conditions preventing them from completing the assessment. After the telephone interview, 735 individuals were either ineligible or declined.\nParticipants then underwent a face-to-face interview, a detailed medical assessment, and neuropsychological testing. Participants were excluded if they scored less than 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or were diagnosed with dementia after the comprehensive assessment.\nEach participants informant completed a phone interview. The participants level of functional impairment was assessed with the Bayer Activities of Daily Living (B-ADL) scale (Lawton and Brody, 1969;Hindmarch et al., 1998).",

The same acquisition parameters were used for both scanners. There were significant differences in some DTI variables between the two scanners. To correct for this, the scanner was included as a binary covariate in all analyses.\nFor the DTI imaging, sensitivity encoding (SENSE) echo planar imaging was used (in-plane resolution 1.953  1.953 mm, 38 slices; 3.5 mm thick; 0 gap; TR 6130.41ms; TE 68 ms; matrix 128  128; flip angle 90  ; FOV 250  133  250 mm). Diffusion-weighted images (b  1000 smm 2 ) were obtained in six directions and one image without any diffusion weighting (b  0 smm 2 ).\nImage processing DTI data were processed using FSL 4.1.4 (FMRIBs Software Library, http:www.fmrib.ox. ac.ukfsl) (Smith et al., 2004). The images were corrected for eddy current and head motion effects using the linear image registration tool, and were skull-stripped using the brain extraction tool. The FSL diffusion toolbox was used to calculate the diffusion tensor eigenvalues, which were used to generate FA, MD, and color-coded DTI. All images were stripped of identifying data, so that the region of interest analysis was performed blinded to any details about the participants.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study provides further evidence that microstructural cerebral abnormalities occur in mild cognitive impairment and sheds some light on the differences between the two main MCI subtypes. The key finding was that individuals with MCI have decreased MD in the right putamen, right anterior limb of the internal capsule, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, left anterior cingulate gyrus, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and right corona radiata.\nOur findings are largely in agreement with previous studies which have reported changes in anterior and posterior cingulate, corpus callosum, and frontal white matter on DTI (Fellgiebel et al., 2005;Medina et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2007;Shim et al., 2008;Mielke et al., 2009). Additionally, we observed increased MD in subcortical regions such as the putamen and internal capsule.\nPrevious studies using automated voxel-wise analysis have found decreased FA in the internal capsule of MCI and AD patients (Medina et al., 2006;Xie et al., 2006). The present study found elevated MD in the internal capsule and right corona radiata in MCI. The internal capsule and corona radiata contain projection fibers travelling from the cortex to the brainstem and from the thalamus to the cortex. The detection of abnormalities in these fibers in MCI is surprising given that motor signs occur late in the case of AD. These regions are supplied by penetrating arteries and thus are susceptible to ischemic damage. Thus, the results may reflect the early changes of non-Alzheimers dementia such as vascular dementia.\nIn our study, after controlling for vascular risk factors, the changes seen in the corona radiata on DTI were no longer significant. However, it is unclear whether this is due to a mediation effect or due to vascular risk factors causing changes and cognitive decline via independent mechanisms. In a previous study, MCI patients with signs of subcortical vascular disease have been found to have higher MD and lower FA in the centrum semiovale, which is the rostral continuation of the corona radiata (Shim et al., 2008). This finding, together with our present findings, suggests that vascular pathology may contribute to the microstructural cerebral changes in MCI. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of vascular disease and risk factors to changes in the basal ganglia and corona radiata seen using DTI.\nMD in the genu of the corpus callosum, left superior frontal gyrus, and right corona radiata was the best combination of predictors for MCI in stepwise logistic regression analysis. However, this only accounted for 10 of the variance. This is understandable considering that the relationship between brain morphology and cognition is an imperfect one, and most measures of morphology do not predict cognitive function. Moreover, cognition is affected by multiple pathologies, not all of which are reflected in MD changes.\nAlthough it has been suggested that MCI subtypes represent different etiologies, there are still limited data to support this assumption. Longitudinal studies suggest that although aMCI is more likely to progress to AD, naMCI also frequently progresses to AD (Busse et al., 2006;Fischer et al., 2007). In the binary logistic regression analyses, MD in the left anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, genu of the corpus callosum, and right corona radiata emerged as significant independent predictors of aMCI. Previous studies of aMCI have also found decreased FA in the anterior cingulate and frontal white matter (Medina et al., 2006;Mielke et al., 2009). Decreased FA in the corpus callosum has been seen in AD (Xie et al., 2006). Our finding of abnormalities in the genu of the corpus callosum has been supported by a recent study that found atrophy in the anterior corpus callosum in aMCI (Di Paola et al., 2010). Overall, these findings suggest that damage to anterior brain structures may be a significant feature of aMCI. While the present study and one previous study have found changes in the anterior cingulate in aMCI but not in the posterior cingulate on DTI (Mielke et al., 2009), other studies of aMCI have found changes in the posterior cingulate on DTI (Fellgiebel et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2007). This variation may be due to differences in the study population and method of DTI analysis. Future tractography studies may be able to determine the extent of changes more reliably in both the anterior and posterior cingulate.\nIn our study, the subtype analysis did not find major differences between the aMCI group and naMCI group. Comparison of the subtypes with control group did suggest that abnormalities in subcortical regions such as the putamen and internal capsule were more prominent in naMCI and changes in the anterior brain such as prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate in aMCI. A logistic regression showed increased MD in the left anterior cingulate gyrus and reduced FA in the left frontal gyrus as distinguishing aMCI from naMCI. These differences must be interpreted cautiously, and may suggest that cortical changes, especially on the left side may be more characteristic of the aMCI syndrome, while naMCI, which is possibly a more heterogeneous entity, may have more subcortical abnormalities.\nA major limitation of this study was the suboptimal acquisition strategy for the FA measure. This may explain why no significant FA differences were observed in this study. Due to scanner software limitations at the time of acquisition, only six-directional imaging with a single average was available. FA has been shown to vary significantly depending on the number of diffusion-weighted directions used; in contrast, MD has been found to be unaffected by the number of diffusion directions used (Giannelli et al., 2009). The low number of diffusion directions used in this study is expected to have limited the accuracy of FA measurements, thus reducing the sensitivity of this study to FA changes. However, we were able to detect multiple areas with MD changes. The cross-sectional design of the study limits our ability to draw conclusions about the causal relationship between cerebral microstructural changes and MCI and its subtypes. The cohort will be followed longitudinally to evaluate whether the observed patterns of changes using DTI are predictive of cognitive decline and progression to different types of dementia.\nIn conclusion, our study shows changes on DTI in a large sample of participants with MCI. There were few differences between the amnestic and non-amnestic subtypes of MCI with FA of the left superior temporal gyrus and MD of the left anterior cingulate distinguishing aMCI from naMCI.",

    "abstract": "Background: Quantitative neuroimaging might unveil abnormalities in prion diseases that are not perceivable at visual inspection. On the other hand, scarce studies have quantified volumetric changes in prion diseases. Objectives: We aim to characterize volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in patients with prion diseases who presented with either Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or fatal insomnia (FI) phenotype. Methods: Twenty patients with prion diseases-15 with CJD and 5 with fatal insomnia (FI)-and 40 healthy controls were examined with a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Images were segmented and normalized with SPM12. DTI maps were obtained with FMRIB Software Library. Whole-brain voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses of volumetric and DTI changes were performed with SPM12. White matter (WM) changes were also analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics. Semiquantitive assessment of neuropathological parameters was compared with DTI metrics in thalamus from 11 patients. Results: Patients with CJD and FI presented significant atrophy in thalamus and cerebellum. In CJD, mean diffusivity (MD) was decreased in striatum and increased in subcortical WM, while both increased and decreased values were observed across different thalamic nuclei. In FI, MD was increased in thalamus and cerebellum. Spongiform change and PrP Sc deposition were more intense in thalamus in CJD than in FI, although no significant correlations arose with MD values in the nuclei studied. Conclusion: Volumetric and DTI abnormalities suggest a central common role of the thalamus in prion diseases. We report, for the first time, quantitative MRI changes in FI, and provide further evidence of WM involvement in prion diseases.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Prion diseases are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the deposition of misfolded prion proteins (PrP Sc ) in the brain. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), its most common form, is characterized by progressive dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus, with spongiform change, neuronal loss, gliosis, and PrP Sc deposits widely distributed throughout the brain. This phenotype differs from fatal insomnia (FI), another prion disease that can be either sporadic (MM2T or thalamic form of CJD) or genetic (caused by D178N substitution in the prion protein gene), and is distinguished by disrupted circadian rhythms, cognitive deterioration, dysautonomic and motor abnormalities, with severe thalamic, inferior olivary, and cerebellar degeneration 1.\nWhile visual assessment of computed tomography scans or T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually normal or shows nonspecific atrophy at late stages of prion diseases 2,3 diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) has demonstrated high sensitivity for the identification of hyperintense signal in cortical and subcortical grey matter (GM) of patients with CJD 4,5. This contrasts with the lack of specific structural neuroimaging findings in FI 1,6. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative volumetric MRI have been used to characterize and quantify brain changes in different neurological disorders 789. These tools provide relevant information concerning both macro and microstructural changes, might reveal specific alterations that cannot be captured by naked eye visual assessment and can potentially be used as markers of disease progression in clinical trials 10. Scarce studies have applied these methodologies in prion diseases and several have used a region-of-interest (ROI)-based methodology, which is suitable for hypothesis-driven studies, but entails the potential risk of overlooking regional changes that occur beyond ROIs 7,1112131415.\nIn this study, we use a whole-brain, voxel-based approach, in combination with a ROI-based analysis, to investigate volumetric and DTI changes in patients with prion disease with either CJD or FI phenotype, and correlate them with neuropathological features. Our aim is to understand the in vivo histopathological changes that occur in the brain of these patients. This information may help in the interpretation of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and DTI data in case these tools are used as biomarkers for prion diseases.",

      "text": "Twenty subjects with definite or probable prion diseases according to the World Health Organization andor the European Consortium diagnostic criteria 5,16 were prospectively recruited at the Alzheimers and other Cognitive Disorders Unit of Hospital Clínic de Barcelona between February 2011 and April 2015. Participants underwent an extensive work-up for rapidly progressive dementias. Clinical evaluation included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MRC Prion Disease Rating Scale 17,18. PRNP genotype was determined by direct sequencing. According to their clinical phenotype (irrespective of their genetic status), patients were classified as CJD or FI, and analyzed separately. The rationale for pooling genetic and sporadic cases together in a same group is based on the aim to evaluate clinico-pathologically defined phenotypes, independently of their cause, and on that patients with genetic and sporadic CJD present a similar clinico-radiological phenotype, as patients with sporadic and familial FI do 1,4. Forty age-and gender-adjusted healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls. All participants signed an informed consent before their enrolment in the study, which was approved by the Hospital Cl ínic Ethics Committee.",

    "Image acquisition and analysis": {
      "text": "MRI scans were performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio Tim, Siemens Medical Systems, Germany). A high resolution 3D structural T1-weighted dataset (MP-RAGE, TR  2300 ms, TE  2.98 ms, 240 slices, FOV  256 mm, matrix size  256256, slice thickness  1 mm) was acquired for all subjects. The DTI protocol consisted on an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 30 directions b0 image, with 2 repeated acquisitions, TR  7600 ms, TE  89 ms, 60 slices (thickness  2 mm), distance factor  0, FOV  250 mm, matrix size  122  122, voxel size  2  2  2 mm. All images were visually inspected to ensure their quality. Due to motion artifacts, four subjects (three CJD, one FI) were excluded from the volumetric analysis and two subjects with CJD from the DTI analysis. Images were reoriented along the anterior-posterior commissure line. VBM analysis was performed with SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Welcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UK; http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspm). Total GM, white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and total intracranial volume (TIV) were calculated based on the tissue probability maps obtained with the new segment tool. Images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space using diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) and smoothed convolving by an Isotropic Gaussian kernel with 8 mm of FWHM 19. The two runs of DTI images acquired for each subject were concatenated in a single file. Next, images were corrected for eddy current distortion and head motion, and registered to 3D T1 using FLIRT and FNIRT (as part of the package FMRIB Software Library (FSL); http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) maps were obtained from whole-brain images using FSL. Skeletonized maps of DTI indices were obtained using the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) tool implemented in FSL 20. Significant clusters were identified using the Johns Hopkins University WM tractography atlas and the International Consortium of Brain Mapping ICBM-DTI WM labels atlas 21. Averaged values of FA, MD, AD, and RD were extracted from clusters with significant differences. Mean MD and volume values were extracted from ROI masks of thalamic nuclei (anterior, lateral dorsal, lateral posterior, medial dorsal, midline, ventral anterior, ventral lateral, ventral posterior lateral and ventral posterior medial nuclei, lateral and medial geniculate bodies, and pulvinar). These masks were generated using WFU pickatlas software implemented in SPM12, based on the Talairach Daemon database 22,23.",

In 11 subjects (seven CJD and four FI), who also had available DTI data, a semiquantification of spongiform change, neuronal loss, gliosis and presence of PrP Sc deposits (0  absent; 1  mild; 2  moderate; 3  extensive) was performed in four thalamic nuclei: anterior, medial dorsal and ventral lateral nuclei, and pulvinar.",

For TBSS analysis, the number of permutations was set at 5000, and age and gender were entered as covariates. Statistical significance was set at p corr 0.05, after family-wise error (FWE) correction, using the threshold-free cluster enhancement option (TFCE), implemented in FSL 25. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences in volume and DTI metrics in thalamic ROIs between patients and controls, as well as differences in neuropathological features between CJD and FI groups. Linear regression was used to explore the influence of spongiform change, neuronal loss, gliosis, and PrP Sc deposition on MD values. Time between MRI acquisition and neuropathological study was included in the analysis as a confounding factor. For these analyses, STATA 12 software (Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. StataCorp LP, Tex., USA) was used and significance threshold was set at an FDR adjusted p-value of 0.05, by using the Simes method for multiple hypothesis testing 26.",

The exclusion of genetic cases from the CJD group yielded slightly larger clusters in the same cerebral regions in the VBM and DTI analysis. In the FI group, significant differences in the VBM analysis remain but at a less exigent threshold (p unc  0.005), which suggest that differences would be attributable to real group differences rather than to an individual effect.

The remaining four had a FI phenotype (three with D178N mutation and one sporadic case with MM2TC subtype). Table 4 shows the severity scores of neuropathological alterations in thalamic nuclei. CJD patients exhibited higher scores of spongiform change and PrP Sc deposition than FI patients. These differences were statistically significant for PrP Sc in all nuclei (p corr  0.03) and for spongiform change in all but the anterior nucleus (p corr  0.03). Additionally, a trend was observed toward higher neuronal loss (p corr  0.07) and gliosis (p corr  0.06) in FI in the anterior nucleus. In other nuclei, neuronal loss and gliosis were also higher in FI but differences were not statistically significant. Globally, spongiform change was more prominent in VV2 than in MM1 CJD subtype, and gliosis was frequently gemistocytic in VV2 compared to the chronic and fibrillary glial reaction seen in FI cases. Linear regression did not show any significant correlation between MD and individual neuropathological alterations in patients with prion diseases, despite reduced MD values were only observed in patients with CJD, who showed higher spongiform change and PrP Sc deposition scores in thalamic nuclei than FI patients. However, this correlation was not evaluated in ventral posterior medial and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, as the protocol used for preparing brain slices did not allow a reliable identification of these thalamic subnuclei.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "We quantified volumetric and DTI changes in patients with prion diseases with either CJD or FI phenotypes and found prominent thalamic alterations in both groups. In CJD, both decreased and increased MD was observed across different thalamic subnuclei. MD was also decreased in basal ganglia, and increased in subcortical WM and cerebellum. We report for the first time quantitative MRI findings in FI, which were characterized by increased MD in thalamus and cerebellum, overlapping with areas of GM loss.\nVBM revealed significant atrophy in thalamus and cerebellum in CJD and FI. Volume loss was also present in putamen, fusiform gyrus, and left perirolandic cortex in CJD, and in medulla oblongata in FI. Structural imaging in prion disease is usually considered normal at visual inspection except for advanced cases. There are scarce volumetric studies in prion diseases and, to the best of our knowledge, no published studies of quantitative MRI data in FI 1. Volume loss has been reported in cerebral cortex in the slowly evolving prion disease linked to 6 octapeptide repeat insertion in PRNP and in cerebellum in genetic CJD 11,14. In contrast, one study failed to show significant GM loss in subjects with sporadic CJD 7. The use of a stronger magnet, which allows a higher signal-to-noise ratio and therefore a higher spatial resolution, and a voxel-based approach, which overcomes the possibility of diluting regional changes and missing regions that have not been considered in a priori hypotheses, may account for some differences between ours and previously reported findings, concerning volumetric changes.\nOur findings of decreased MD in basal ganglia and thalamus in CJD are in line with previous studies 7,13. Both thalamic ROI-based and whole-brain analyses evidenced significantly decreased MD in ventral posterior medial and ventral posterior lateral nuclei. In contrast, the MD increase observed in anterior, lateral dorsal, midline and ventral anterior nuclei in the ROI-based analysis did not arise in the whole-brain analysis, although areas of increased MD were observed in the thalamus at the uncorrected maps (data not shown). Discordant MD changes were also found in medial dorsal nucleus when comparing whole-brain and ROI-based analyses. These discrepancies may be explained by methodological differences, as areas with significant MD changes in whole-brain analysis may be masked by surrounding areas. The coexistence of areas with decreased and increased MD in CJD is not surprising, as it has been reported that MD may increase during the disease course in brain areas that initially had restricted diffusivity, presumably as a consequence of parenchymal loss 7,27. Unexpectedly, we did not find significantly decreased MD neither in caudate nor in cerebral cortex, despite DWI hyperintensities are frequently observed in these locations in CJD. However, cortical alterations that are easily identified at an individual level may not be detected by quantitative group analysis, because they do not always occur in the same regions. Moreover, spatial normalization can result in a biased estimation of the morphology of cerebral structures, especially in patients with enlarged ventricles, 28 which might explain the absence of significant changes in caudate nucleus in our study, as its small size and periventricular location make it particularly susceptible to this undesired effect 29. Finally, certain differences may lack statistical significance due to insufficient statistical power.\nIn CJD, whole-brain and TBSS analyses revealed increased MD, RD, and AD in subcortical WM, overlapping with areas of decreased FA. Decreased FA is thought to reflect pathological processes such as axonal loss or myelin degeneration. Increased RD has been associated with a disruption of the myelin sheath, while both decreased and increased AD values have been associated with WM tract alterations 9,30. The pattern of reduced FA with increased MD, RD, and AD observed in our study has also been reported in Alzheimers disease, and may reflect secondary WM degeneration due to primary neuronal loss 8. Increased diffusivity has also been described in WM from patients with inherited prion diseases, 12,14 but not in sporadic CJD. On the contrary, Caverzasi and collaborators found significant reductions of MD in WM from patients with sporadic CJD 15. This finding was surprising, as reduced diffusivity in CJD has been associated with spongiform change and PrP Sc deposition, 31 which are typically absent in WM from these patients. The authors also highlighted the presence of astrocytosis and microglial activation in WM, although these were not statistically correlated with reduced MD. Microglial activation was also found to be increased in sporadic CJD but not in FFI in a different study, which allows us to speculate that different patterns of microglial activation might also play a role in different patterns of MD changes in prion diseases 32. In our study, we only found significantly decreased AD in intrathalamic WM tracts, internal capsule, superior cerebellar peduncle, and right external capsule, without significant changes in MD in those areas. Even if we do not have a solid explanation for the discrepancies between our results and those reported by Caverzasi and collaborators, differences in the mean time between symptoms onset and MRI (12 months in their study and 5.2 months in ours) and total disease duration (19 months in their study and 11.5 months in ours) could account for some of these differences, as more prolonged disease course might produce a higher degree of gliosis in WM. Therefore, assuming a hypothetical restriction in diffusivity caused by gliosis, at the time MRI scans were acquired in our study, the increase of diffusivity caused by axonal loss might have outweighed the diffusivity restriction caused by gliosis.\nIn FI, whole-brain analysis revealed increased MD, AD, and RD in thalamus, parahippocampal region, cerebellum, and midbrain, probably reflecting neuronal loss, as these alterations overlapped clusters with volume loss. Both VBM and DTI data evidenced diffuse thalamic damage, with higher involvement of anterior and medial dorsal nuclei, in line with previous studies 1. TBSS analysis showed much more limited WM abnormalities compared to CJD.\nThe fact that MD was reduced in subcortical GM in CJD but not in FI, and spongiform change scores in thalamus were higher in CJD than in FI suggests that MD reduction in CJD may be predominantly caused by spongiform change, which is in line with previous studies 31,33,34. However, we did not find any significant correlation between neuropathological findings and MD values in the thalamus, probably because MD changes are influenced by competing processes (e.g., spongiform changes and neuronal loss) and that neuropathological changes likely evolved since MRI scanning until postmortem examination. In addition, we could not analyze those thalamic nuclei with significant MD reduction in CJD due to technical limitations.\nThe broad and remarkably variable anatomical distribution of the neuropathological alterations observed in CJD is a striking feature of this disease. In this regard, whether PrP Sc initially spreads from a single location or starts simultaneously in multiple regions remains uncertain. However, clinical and experimental evidence point to thalamic involvement as an early event in prion diseases 35,36. Frequent clinical and cognitive features observed in CJD, such as myoclonus, episodic unresponsiveness, interference effects, verbal and motor perseveration, and the presence of periodic sharp wave complexes in electroencephalogram also suggest a critical role of the thalamus 37,38 The thalamus conveys input and output information from different sensory modalities and regions involved in motor regulation, such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex. It also participates in the maintenance of attention, and the anterior nucleus is a key component of Papez circuit 39. Considering its multiple inbound and outbound connections, and in the light ours and previously reported findings, we believe the thalamus might act as the main common hub in CJD (at least in the subtypes represented in our study) and FI from which PrP Sc would spread trans-synaptically to other regions, preferentially to structures that belong to neural networks where the thalamus has an important role, such as striatum, cerebellum, sensory-motor cortex, and medial temporal structures, which were atrophied or showed DTI alterations in patients from our study. Whether these diseases start at the thalamus, in either genetic or sporadic cases, or this is just a common pathway for PrP Sc spreading cannot be elucidated from our data.\nThe main limitation of our study is the sample size, which prevented us to adjust the analyses by disease stage or CJD molecular subtype. Due to the limited sample size, we decided to analyze genetic and sporadic cases in the same group, as our main focus was to perform a neuroradiological characterization of patients based on their common phenotypic features, although we acknowledge that in larger sample sizes, it would be desirable to analyze these groups separately. We also acknowledge a possible pre-inclusion bias that may have led to a misrepresentation of the MM1 CJD subtype in our sample. Patients with MM1 CJD subtype present a faster disease progression, that could limited their chances of being referred to our study from other centers. However, our results encourage us to try to validate them in a larger cohort, ideally, with a multicentric study approach.\nIn summary, volumetric and DTI data point to the thalamus as a common central structure among regions vulnerable to CJD and FI, and therefore it may be considered as a candidate region for monitoring disease progression. DTI metrics show changes in opposite directions in CJD, with decreased MD in the striatum, increased MD in most WM tracts, and both increased and decreased MD values across different thalamic nuclei, which reflect the regional heterogeneity and dynamic nature of CJD neuropathological changes. In addition, the present study reports for the first time quantitative MRI changes in FI, characterized by atrophy and MD increase in thalamus and cerebellum. We believe that our findings, together with prior quantitative MRI studies in prion diseases reported in the literature, contribute to set the basis for using these tools as disease biomarkers.",

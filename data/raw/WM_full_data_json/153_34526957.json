    "abstract": "Objective: The current study seeks to illustrate potential early and objective neurophysiological biomarkers of neurodegenerative cognitive decline by evaluating features of brain network physiological performance and structure utilizing different modalities. Methods: This study included 17 clinically healthy individuals with self-reported cognitive decline (Subjective Cognitive Decline group, SCD, no objective finding of cognitive decline), 12 individuals diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), 11 individuals diagnosed with Dementia, and 15 healthy subjects. All subjects underwent computerized cognitive performance testing, MRI scans including T1 for gray matter (GM) volume quantification, DTI for quantification of white matter (WM) microstructure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and brain network function evaluation using DELPHI (TMS-EEG) measures of connectivity, excitability, and plasticity. Results: Both DELPHI analysis of network function and DTI analysis detected a significant decrease in connectivity, excitability, and WM integrity in the SCD group compared to healthy control (HC) subjects; a significant decrease was also noted for aMCI and Dementia groups compared to HC. In contrast, no significant decrease was observed in GM volume in the SCD group compared to healthy norms, a significant GM volume decrease was observed only in objectively cognitively impaired aMCI subjects and in dementia subjects. Conclusions: This study results suggest that objective direct measures of brain network physiology and WM integrity may provide early-stage biomarkers of neurodegenerative-related changes in subjects that have not yet displayed any other objective measurable cognitive or GM volume deficits which may facilitate early preventive care for neurodegenerative decline and dementia.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Improved medical care and lifestyle continue to increase life span and with it age-related brain disorders (1). The American Academy of Neurology has recently recommended an annual cognitive health assessment for patients 65 years and older (2). The rationale behind this recommendation asserts that brain diseases may be delayed or prevented if detected at early stages and that certain risks associated with compromised brain health are modifiable (3). The lack of effective evaluation tools for brain health leaves most clinical assessments to be based on the patients clinical history and simple cognitive screening, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has therefore recommended routine assessment of cognitive health in high-risk patients. To date, cognitive assessment has been shown to be the most efficient, clinically usable, and cost-effective tool. Nonetheless, it is well established that objective cognitive manifestations of neurodegeneration are observed only in relatively late stages of disease progression and therefore may not provide the desired preventive effect (4). In contrast, specific physiological changes in brain network connectivity and plasticity are known to occur at the early stages of the disease and therefore it is estimated that a large proportion of cerebrovascular diseases and dementias may be prevented or at least delayed if detected during early pathophysiology stages (5).\nIn 2014, the term subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was conceived by researchers to describe the subjective experience of worsening cognitive performance among cognitively normal older individuals. SCD has been shown to indicate an atrisk stage of Alzheimers disease (AD) (6). Several studies, using a variety of assessments, found SCD to predict objective cognitive impairment incidents of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (7,8) and AD dementia. Furthermore, in several crosssectional studies, cognitive complaints were found to correlate with biomarkers of AD pathology such as amyloid-ß (Aß) (9). A meta-analysis of longitudinal epidemiological studies of cognitively unimpaired individuals with SCD (with at least 4 years of follow-up data) demonstrated that people with SCD are at increased risk of developing future MCI and that overall the risk of developing dementia is double in individuals having SCD (10). Neuroimaging studies have shown that ADrelated changes, including hippocampal volume loss and white matter hyperintensities, already occur in older adults with SCD before objective cognitive impairment becomes evident (11)(12)(13)(14)(15), supporting the notion that SCD may provide an indicator of the preclinical phase of AD.\nCognitive complaints may be caused by over 50 known factors such as depression, anxiety, personality factors, and quality of life (16). Improving the characterization of at-risk states and detection of early disease stages are crucial for targeted and effective dementia prevention (1). An ideal method for detecting preclinical, physiological changes reflecting early stages of degeneration would be a patient independent, objective, easily performed, and interpreted method. The current study seeks to illustrate potential early and objective neurophysiological biomarkers of neurodegenerative cognitive decline, by evaluating brain network physiological performance and structure of SCD subjects, aMCI and dementia patients as well as healthy age-related controls, utilizing multiple evaluation paradigms including computerized cognitive performance testing, gray matter (GM) volume, white matter (WM) integrity (Fractional anisotropy and Mean Diffusivity), and brain network function using DELPHI (TMS-EEG) measures of connectivity and plasticity.",

NeuroTrax tests evaluate various aspects of brain functions and include Verbal Memory (immediate and delayed recognition), Non-Verbal Memory (immediate and delayed recognition), Go-No-Go Response Inhibition, Problem Solving, Stroop Interference, Catch Game, and Staged Information Processing Speed (single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit arithmetic). Cognitive index scores were computed from the normalized outcome parameters for memory, executive function (EF), attention, and information processing speed (IPS), (22,23). After administration, the NeuroTrax data were uploaded to the NeuroTrax central server, and outcome parameters were automatically calculated using software blind to the diagnosis or testing site. To account for the well-known effects of age and education on cognitive performance, each outcome parameter was normalized and fit to an IQ-like scale (mean  100, S.D.  15) according to the patients age and education. The normative data used by NeuroTrax consist of test data from cognitively healthy individuals in controlled research studies at more than 10 sites (24).",

Stimulation protocol, acquisition, and data processing using our fully automated DELPHI algorithm were all performed as described previously by Zifman and Levy-Lamdan et al. (29). TMS coil was positioned over the left cortical motor (M1) region at 45  toward the contralateral forehead according to guidelines (30). Single-pulse (no history dependent; 0.3Hz frequency) and 1 Hz (inhibitory frequency) stimulation were performed at 80 from rest motor threshold (RMT) intensity. Data acquisition, pre-processing, and cleaning of the TMS evoked response include rejection of bad channels and epochs containing large artifacts followed by bandpass FIR filter (0.5-45 Hz) as detailed in Zifman and Levy-Lamdan et al. (29). A thin (0.5 mm) Foam pad was attached to the TMS coil to minimize electrode movement and bone-conducted auditory artifact. Participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed throughout the examination to reduce ocular artifacts. The operator of the system conversed with subjects between the short stimulation protocol blocks in order to avoid drowsiness. Electrodes data were grouped to regional recording hotspots for analysis and statistical purposes: Frontal (F3, F5-ipsilateral and F4, and F6contralateral to stimulation.); Parietal (C3, C5, CP1-ipsilateral, and C4, C6, and CP2-contralateral to stimulation); Temporal (CP5, CP3, CF5-ipsilateral, and CP6, CP4, and FC6-contralateral to stimulation); Occipital cortex (O1, PO3-ipsilateral, and O2 PO4-contralateral to stimulation).\nAll data processing, analyses, and statistics were made using MATLAB (R2020a, The Mathworks Inc., MA, United States).",

      "text": "The study included 17 clinically healthy individuals with self-reported cognitive decline (Subjective Cognitive Decline group, SCD, no objective finding of cognitive decline), 12 individuals diagnosed with aMCI, 11 individuals diagnosed with Dementia, and 15 healthy subjects; no significant differences were noted between groups ages and the rest motor threshold (RMT) (Table 1). All subjects underwent a thorough evaluation of brain functional performance and health including MRI scans, a computerized cognitive evaluation including four main cognitive domains: memory, executive function (EF), attention, information processing speed (IPS), and DELPHI (TMS-EEG) neurophysiological brain network evaluation. As expected, computerized cognitive evaluation of these cognitive domains did not reveal any abnormal findings in SCD subjects. All SCD subjects scored within healthy population norms. However, compared to the HC group, a small but significant decrease in memory (6 points, p  0.01) and executive function (8 points, p  0.01) was displayed (Figure 1). The aMCI group displayed an abnormal mean memory performance score (decrease of over 1 STD, p  0.01) and a significant (but within the normal range) decrease in EF and attention domains compared to HC (Figure 1; p  0.01). Mean memory and EF performance were significantly lower in the aMCI group compared to the SCD group as well (Figure 1; p  0.01). Dementia subjects displayed abnormal performance in all cognitive domains with a significant decrease compared to the SCD group, and a significant decrease in attention and IPS compared to aMCI subjects (Figure 1; p  0.01; p  0.05 respectively).\nGM volume Region of interest (ROI) analysis of T1 demonstrated no significant decrease in GM volume for SCD compared to healthy norms. The left hippocampus and right Insula GM were significantly lower in aMCI compared to HC (Table 2; p  0.05). Left hippocampus volume was significantly lower while right hippocampus was lower but not significant in aMCI compared to SCD (Table 2; p  0.05, p  0.05 respectively). Other areas did not display any significant changes between SCD and aMCI. GM volume ROI analysis in Dementia subjects displayed a significant decrease in all areas, excluding the left frontalorbital region, compared to SCD (Table 2; p  0.01), no significant difference was displayed between Dementia and aMCI group (Table 2; p  0.01). WM integrity was evaluated by computing FA and MD for major ROIs including Corpus Callosum (CC), Corona Radiata, Cingulum, Fornix, and Fronto-Occipital fibers. DTI-FA analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in WM fibers FA between HC and SCD for the CC, anterior Corona Mean Diffusivity (MD) measures of WM integrity support FA measures, demonstrating increased MD in the SCD group compared to HC for Genu of the CC, Fornix, Hippocampus, and Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus. The aMCI groups MD is increased in the splenum of CC and fornix alone compared to HC (Table 4; p  0.05). No significant difference was observed between SCD and aMCI groups. However, the dementia group displayed significantly higher MD in the splenum of CC (p  0.01) and body of CC (p  0.05) compared to SCD (Table 4). Significantly higher MD values were measured in the Dementia group compared with HC in the CC, Fornix, and Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, (Table 4; p  0.05). DELPHI (TMS-EEG) analysis of network functional changes revealed a significant difference between HC and SCD group in the evaluated parameters of connectivity (Wave Form Adherence (WFA, Figures 2A,D; p  0.05) and excitability 2A-D; p  0.01), in all DELPHI parameters, including STP (short term plasticity). DELPHI measures are in line with the changes observed in the WM integrity, both FA and MD, demonstrating high sensitivity of both DELPHI physiological measures of brain network integrity and WM changes to reflect early changes in SCD, prior to evident cognitive decline as observed in the aMCI and Dementia groups. This observation is consistent with previous data demonstrating WM changes in SCD prior to evident cognitive decline (10)(11)(12)(13)(14).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The data presented in this study display brain network functional connectivity and plasticity as potential biomarkers for preclinical pathological degeneration. Study results indicate that although no pathological cognitive changes were detected in the SCD population compared to healthy norms, brain network functional and structural connectivity measured by DELPHI (TMS-EEG) and DTI in SCD subjects were significantly changed. In contrast, SCD subjects did not display any significant decrease in GM volume of specific ROIs related to cognitive neurodegeneration. A significant decrease in GM volume was evident only in aMCI and dementia groups compared to HC and SCD. This data supports the concept that changes in brain network function and microstructure connectivity precede manifestation in gray matter and objectively measured cognitive performance. Previous studies have also displayed such neurophysiological and microstructural disruptions prior to structural atrophy in individuals with SCD in parietal, frontal and hippocampal areas (31,32). Interestingly, both WM and EEG-TMS measures of brain function display no significant differences between SCD and aMCI. These results may be caused by the limited number of subjects in the aMCI group or by the fact that the SCD group included subjects that were actively seeking treatment for their subjective cognitive decline and maybe at more progressive stages than other SCD subjects. In this study, no significant changes were found in WM, GM, and neurophysiological measures between aMCI and dementia groups. These results are supported by Kiuchi et al. (33,34) but are not consistent with other studies that display WM changes between aMCI and dementia patients (35) and may be caused by the ROI-based analysis and small sample size of both the aMCI and dementia groups. These results may indicate that although the cognitive decline between aMCI and dementia is evident, the majority of neurophysiological and brain tissue damage has occurred before cognitive performance is compromised and may be objectively diagnosed. The results of this study, together with previous work, help support the understanding that brain network integrity deterioration precedes objective cognitive impairment and might be subjectively experienced by the patient. This concept is indactive of the early clinical manifestation of neurophysiological and microstructural changes as described schematically in It is important to note that, cognitive complaints in both SCD and aMCI may be caused by various factors such as depression, anxiety, and others, part of which may result in neurodegeneration and progress to different dementia types. These non-degenerative factors should be identified as they are treated and handled differently from neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the current study compares different groups of subjects; healthy, SCD as well as aMCI and dementia representing subjects at different stages of cognitive impairment related to neurodegeneration. As this study is not a longitudinal study, in order to support its clinical findings and relevance, further longitudinal follow-up studies utilizing these clinical tools with controlled mood, cognitive, and other risk factors evaluations are required. In addition, the small sample size for each subject group in this study requires further validation in larger study groups. Nonetheless, the data presented in this study provides evidence supporting previous studies displaying noticeable physiological changes in brain network connectivity and function in earlier stages than detected nowadays using currently available standard of care tools as cognitive assessment and imaging tools (MR or CT) for structural brain imaging (36,37).",

      "text": "Detection of at-risk states and early disease stages are crucial for targeted and effective neurodegenerative dementia prevention. The data presented in this study suggest potential early detection biomarkers of changes in brain network integrity (connectivity and functionality) utilizing DTI or DELPHI (TMS-EEG) modalities. These data support our previous study that demonstrated the high correlation of DELPHI neurophysiological measures to WM integrity (38) and supports physiological evidence which singles out the SCD population as being at high risk for developing MCI and dementia. These tools and biomarkers may indicate early physiological changes in such at-risk and early disease stages, thus provide clinically available early-stage biomarkers of neurodegenerative related changes in subjects that have not yet displayed any other objective measurable cognitive deficits or GM volume decrease and facilitate the prevention of further neurodegenerative deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Background: The nonmotor symptom spectrum of Parkinsons disease (PD) includes progressive cognitive decline mainly in late stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to map the patterns of altered structural connectivity of patients with PD with different cognitive profiles ranging from cognitively unimpaired to PD-associated dementia. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging and neuropsychological data from the observational multicentre LANDSCAPE study were analyzed. A total of 134 patients with PD with normal cognitive function (56 PD-N), mild cognitive impairment (67 PD-MCI), and dementia (11 PD-D) as well as 72 healthy controls were subjected to whole-brain-based fractional anisotropy mapping and covariance analysis with cognitive performance measures. Results: Structural data indicated subtle changes in the corpus callosum and thalamic radiation in PD-N, whereas severe white matter impairment was observed in both PD-MCI and PD-D patients including anterior and inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate, insular cortices, superior longitudinal fasciculi, corona radiata, and the body of the corpus callosum. These regional alterations were demonstrated for PD-MCI and were more pronounced in PD-D. The pattern of involved regions was significantly correlated with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) total score. Conclusions: The findings in PD-N suggest impaired cross-hemispherical white matter connectivity that can apparently be compensated for. More pronounced involvement of the corpus callosum as demonstrated for PD-MCI together with affection of fronto-parietotemporal structural connectivity seems to lead to gradual disruption of cognition-related cortico-cortical networks and to be associated with the onset of overt cognitive deficits. The increase of regional white matter damage appears to be associated with the development of PD-associated dementia.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The recognition that the pathological process underlying sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD) extends far beyond the dopaminergic system 1 has fundamentally changed the understanding of PD pathogenesis and therapeutic options. 2 A broad spectrum of nonmotor features including cognitive decline accompany the course of PD 3 and impacts health-related quality of life 4 and survival. The Braak hypothesis 1 proposes an ascending pattern of pathology spreading from the lower brain stem (presymptomatic stages 1-2) to mesencephalic structures including the substantia nigra (early symptomatic stage 3-4). The development of cognitive deficits 5 is a functional consequence of late symptomatic stages (Braak stages 5-6) when the underlying pathological process finally reaches the neocortex. 6 The cognitive profile of PD patients spanning from cognitively normal (PD-N) to the transient phase of mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and finally to the full picture of PD-associated dementia (PD-D) has been well defined. 7 Accumulating evidence from neuroimaging studies suggest an abnormal network architecture in PD patients involving frontal and interhemispheric white matter systems which have been shown to be related to cognitive status. 891011 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful for investigating hippocampal connections and frontostriatal circuits that have been discussed to mediate cognitive decline and have been suggested to be a potential candidate as an in vivo surrogate marker for cognitive impairment in PD. 12 However, the corresponding patterns of structural abnormalities in neuropsychologically characterized patients with PD and their relations to cognitive performance have not yet been systematically investigated in a homogeneous large cohort including PD-N, PD-MCI, and PD-D subtypes.\nThe present study aimed to gain mechanistic insights and to put quantitative evidence to the structural imaging correlates of the continuous process of cognitive decline by investigating microstructural changes in a large PD patient sample comprising PD-N, PD-MCI and PD-D. We hypothesized that cognitively unimpaired patients with PD will present with, if at all, mild white matter lesions while patients with cognitive impairment would show a pattern of disrupted connections between mesocortical and neocortical areas (in accordance with the Braak staging model). Next, we hypothesized that correlations with neuropsychological parameters would allow us to identify the signature of microstructural impairment in specific cognitive domains. The hypotheses were tested in a multicentre cohort study of PD patients from the prospective observational LANDSCAPE study, designed to trace the course of PD from cognitively normal to PD-associated dementia. 13 Cross-sectional baseline data sets including DTI data together with a full neuropsychological profile were analyzed.",

For inclusion, patients were between 45 and 80 years of age and met the diagnosis of PD according to the UK Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. 14 Patients were excluded for the following reasons: (1) diagnosis of or evidence for atypical Parkinson syndromes; (2) other causes of dementia based on clinical grounds; (3) severe cognitive impairment that impedes consent; (4) medical and ethical reasons in relation to the morphological and neurobiological examinations; and (5) pregnancy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and all assessments including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition followed the LANDSCAPE consortium guidelines, for details refer to Balzer-Geldsetzer and colleagues. 13 All patients included in the LANDSCAPE study provided detailed written and informed consent. The LANDSCAPE study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Philipps University Marburg (approval no. 2511, 18 October 2011) together with the local ethics committees of all participating centres (Table 1).",

With regard to this cut-off score, exceptions could be made according to the experts ratings if clinicians found that clear cognitive impairment was evident despite performance above this cut-off score (e.g. in highly educated individuals) or if a performance of a specific patient who scored below this cut-off was still evaluated as within normal range by the person performing the test. The group of PD-MCI patients were categorized depending on their cognitive profile into one of the four MCI subtypes according to the established MCI criteria, 16 i.e. amnestic MCI-single domain (4.8), amnestic MCI-multidomain (28.6), nonamnestic MCIsingle domain (54.7), and nonamnestic MCImultidomain (11.9). Patients with cognitive impairment who: (1) performed in at least one diagnostically relevant neuropsychological test in at least two cognitive domains below the normative cut-off score, and (2) presented with significant impairment in activities of daily living according to medical history (social, occupational, or personal care) were classified as PD-D. 17 For group comparisons, age-matched controls were sampled from the overall control cohort (n  72) resulting in three control subgroups including: (1) age-matched controls for PD-N patients (n  56), (2) age-matched controls for PD-MCI patients (n  67), and (3) age-and educationmatched controls for PD-D patients (n  22).

Classification of white matter lesions by grades 0-3 followed the rating scale by Fazekas and colleagues. 28 Statistical data analysis Sociodemographic, clinical, and neuropsychological data analysis was applied using the MATLABbased Statistical Toolbox (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Parametric unpaired twosample Students t tests for unequal variances were performed to test for differences between two groups, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks was performed in the case of three or more groups and were followed in the event of significance by post hoc testing using unaired two-sample Students t tests for unequal variances. All tests were two-sided, and the p value threshold for statistical significance was set to 0.005 for claims of new discoveries. 29 Voxel-wise statistical comparisons (whole-brainbased spatial statistics; WBSS) of the DTI maps were performed by voxel-wise two-sample Students t tests for unequal variances, followed by multiple comparisons correction using the false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm at a 5 level using the software package TIFT 20 ; the DTI metrics maps (i.e. FA, AD, MD, RD) were thresholded for values 0.2. 30 The cluster size of 256 voxels corresponds to a sphere with a radius of two recording voxels (comparable to the filter size of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM)). To further reduce false-positive findings, a parametric correlation-based clustering procedure that discarded isolated clusters at a threshold cluster size of 256 voxels was applied. 22 All correlations were analyzed in the group of all PD patients (n  134) using Spearman rank order correlations. Voxel-wise correlations between FA values and cognitive measures (i.e. CERAD total score) resulted in correlations maps (r maps) that were subjected to the FDR algorithm at a 5 level, followed by a clustering procedure omitting cluster size below 512 voxels. 22 In addition, significant clusters as revealed from group-wise comparison i.e. PD patients (n  134) versus controls (n  72) were subjected to cluster-wise Spearman rank order correlations to both CERAD total score and to CERAD subscores that included the Boston naming test, constructional praxis, verbal fluency, word list discrimination, word list learning, and word list recall.",

From a methodological perspective, it is of note that the PD-D group was of limited size (11 cases) compared with the much larger samples of PD-N (n  56) and PD-MCI (n  67). In order to validate these findings, group contrasts in all DTI metrics were computed for PD-D patients (n  11) against an age-and education-matched control group (n  22) out of the n  72 control sample (Supplementary Table 1 for details of this matched control cohort). The results demonstrated that the effect of higher age and less education years in PD-D patients compared with the overall control cohort are negligibly small (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Very pronounced white matter involvement as demonstrated for PD-D patients versus controls (Figure 2, lower row) could be shown in the group comparison within the patient cohort, (i.e. comparing PD-N and PD-D patients), which mainly indicated significant FA decrease in the superior longitudinal fasciculus see also Figure 3(a), lower panel.

The pattern of microstructural involvement in cognition-related fibre bundles forming cortico-cortical, cortico-striatal and cortico-thalamic connections was associated with worse cognitive performance.

    "Microstructural changes and cognitive decline": {
      "text": "Microstructural impairment in cognitively normal PD patients has not been reported by other DTI studies 9,11 who used a tract-based spatial statistics approach. However, their findings are consistent with our data for cortical areas, whereas our WBSS approach revealed focal microstructural damage mainly in the thalamic radiation and corpus callosum. Involvement of the thalamic radiation indicates an impaired striatal loop at the functional level, consistent with motor symptoms defining the symptomatic stage of the disease. 33 The impairment of the corpus callosum points towards affected interhemispheric connectivity that possibly shapes the onset of cognitive deficits, as indicated by the correlations with cognitive performance loss. A straightforward conclusion from these results might be the assumption of adaptive mechanisms that fully compensate mild damage in the corpus callosum. Moreover, one may hypothesize that beginning structural impairment is not yet severe enough to cause cognitive decline evident by performance below the detectable threshold of impairment in PD-N. This statement receives support from resting-state functional connectivity data from the LANDSCAPE study in a monocentric cohort of 31 PD patients. 34 First, functional connectivity in cognitively normal PD patients within cognitionrelated functional networks (e.g. default-mode network) was increased which is most likely an adaptive functional re-organizing mechanism that aims at compensation for ongoing cell loss. 35 Second, functional connectivity in disease-related networks was decreased in cognitively impaired PD patients mainly along the fronto-cingulo-midline cores. In a second study on this subcohort, it could be demonstrated that this pattern of reduced functional connectivity was positively correlated with cognitive performance. 36 The present data provide a possible structural correlate to these findings from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.\nInvolvement of the corpus callosum was observed to be more pronounced in PD-MCI. Interestingly, according to our data, white matter damage in the superior corona radiata and the cingulum seems to correspond to the observed functional connectivity loss between frontal and posterior brain regions. White matter lesions in fronto-temporoparietal fibre bundles have been consistently reported in PD-MCI 9 which is linked to a disrupted structural network as demonstrated by a connectome-based study 11 PD-D patients revealed a more pronounced pattern of white matter involvement especially in fronto-temporoparietal fibre bundles as compared with the white matter involvement in PD-MCI patients, a finding which is in line with a recently published DTI study in PD-D patients. 37 As indicated by the correlation analysis and the WBSS analysis in different PD cognitive performers, fronto-temporo-parietal structural connections together with the frontoinsular regions appear to critically contribute to the development of cognitive decline. These findings received support from previous findings in PD-MCI patients with reduced functional connectivity between the cores of the dorsal attention network and right frontoinsular regions in MCI patients that were associated with worse performance in attention executive functions. 38 What ultimately pushes the patients across a barrier of detectable cognitive decline? The risk of developing cognitive deficits increases with disease progression 32 and, according to our data, cognitive impairment, apparently becomes evident when critical white matter damage has been reached and compensation is no longer possible. Cerebrovascular white matter lesions negatively impact cognitive performance. 39 Hence, we quantified the cerebrovascular lesion load in this study and demonstrated no differences in PD-N, PD-MCI, and PD-D groups as compared with controls. This result suggests that the vascular lesion load can be assumed not to confound the analyses and that PD-associated pathology is most likely the main driving factor of the observed cognitive deficits.\nThe present data support that the affectation of fronto-parietal pathways mainly including the superior corona radiata and cingulum is associated with a decline in cognitive performance that becomes worse with a more pronounced involvement of fronto-parieto-temporal pathways as demonstrated for the superior fasciculus in cognitively impaired PD. With respect to the Braak staging hypothesis, 1 cognitive impairment in PD is a clinical consequence in stage 5 and 6 when pathology reaches the mesocortex and association neocortex including high-order sensory association areas and prefrontal fields. Therefore, PD-associated dementia is attributable to stage 5 with involvement of the neocortex affecting additionally primary and secondary motor areas. 31 Studies suggest the impairment of the cognitive striatal loop projecting from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the striatum to be associated with early dysexecutive functions in PD. 40,41 The selective neuronal vulnerability in PD targets only a few susceptible neurons 6 which gradually disrupts structural network connectivity most likely affecting the connections rather that the hubs themselves. The decline of structural connections caused by microstructural alterations are too narrow to explain the picture of severe cognitive difficulties. 42 However, the disruption of cortico-cortical networks is associated with cognitive deficits and has been evidenced by graphbased measures in cognitively normal and PD-MCI patients. 11 Despite mild white matter changes in the absence of cognitive deficits as seen for PD-N patients, it has been recently demonstrated that the overall structural organization remains intact in an early phase of PD, but functional modular organization dramatically changes later in the disease. 43,44 Limitations and caveats A limitation of this study is that the assignment of patients with PD to either the PD-N or PD-MCI group was not based on the recently proposed The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria 45 as these diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI were not available at study set-up. 13 Thus, the proportion of PD-N and PD-MCI might be slightly different when applying the MDS criteria with which fewer patients would have been assigned to the PD-MCI category, 7 due to the fact that abnormal performance in two tests within each of the five cognitive domains are required to fulfil the level II diagnostic MDS criteria 45 in comparison with the criteria used in this study, (i.e. scores 1.5 SD below normative mean values in at least one of the cognitive tests are required to fulfil the MCI diagnosis). 16 Since the MDS criteria are also dependent on either the patient or informant or a clinician (according to the inclusion criteria), a retrospective re-evaluation of the PD-MCI would have been confounded by the nonstandardized (subjective) clinicians rating at each site. Nevertheless, as the impact of different criteria is important and will influence the interpretation of the results of our and also other studies, the DEMPARKLANDSCAPE consortium will present a separate analysis on this aspect (then using the language items of the MMSE as the second language assessment). Finally, we would like to emphasize that, despite the shortcoming of not using the PD-MCI criteria, we are convinced that our study is able to provide valuable data to the field, because data can be compared with other important large studies on PD-MCI which, for example, used mean z scores for each cognitive domain which partly relied on only one test. 46,47 Although the number of included cases is large, the study included a limited number of fully demented cases (PD-D, n  11) which does not allow a sufficient characterization of white matter impairment as compared with the sufficiently powered cohorts of PD-MCI and PD-N patients. However, due to a high physical burden that accompanies cognitive decline, the imaging data from further PD-D cases were in particular confounded by motion artefacts or it was simply impossible to perform the MRI scan for ethical reasons. The various centre-specific confounding MRI acquisition factors were controlled for; however, the possibly negative impact of different MR scanner vendors may still remain a concern.\nAnother limitation of the DEMPARKLANDSCPE study design is that the healthy controls received a limited neuropsychological assessment. However, although the MMSE has limited sensitivity to detect MCI, it seems safe to consider that all controls performing better than 27 points in the MMSE are unlikely to have cognitive deficits. Moreover, the available healthy controls from the LANDSCAPE database differ from PD patients in age and years of education. The higher controls education level compared with the PD patients is a potential confounding factor since it is possibly associated with a higher patient-dependent cognitive reserve and with a higher ability to compensate for brain alterations. 48 The possible impact of age on the DTI data was minimized by first, matching a subsample of the healthy controls to each of the patient groups, and second, performing a centrewise age correction. Importantly, the level of education was similar between the PD subgroups.",

      "text": "Future connectivity analyses in PD may progress towards the emerging in vivo concept of jointly studying the underlying neuropathology by the continuous formation of α-synuclein immunoreactive inclusion bodies 49 and brain connectomics. 50 This concept paves an important future avenue of understanding models of α-synuclein trafficking and the substrate of (mal)functioning of interconnected networks. Unlike Tau-pathology which can be imaged using Tau-positron emission tomography (PET), the development of a corresponding αsynuclein PET tracer remains to be established. Still, regional FA changes as detectable by DTI can give clues for hot spots of focal white matter damage due to PD-associated pathology. 51,52 Utilized graph-based connectivity analyses of structural connectivity data in association with WBSS may allow to investigate whether a strong region-specific relation of regional white matter damage directly impacts decreased coupling of a coinciding network hub, as recently demonstrated for Alzheimers disease. 53 Following this journals.sagepub.comhometan 13 hypothesis, it remains to be investigated whether the opposite reorganization of the connectivity graph can be demonstrated in PD where higher levels of microstructural focal damage strengthen network connections.",

      "text": "The results of this study suggest that mildly affected cross-hemispherical connectivity can be compensated up to a point where involvement of the corpus callosum becomes more pronounced together with affection of long-range fronto-parieto-temporal structural connectivity such that cognitive impairment gets clinically recognisable. This leads to gradual disruption of cognitionrelated cortico-cortical networks which may be associated with cognitive decline and the onset of the transient phase of MCI. When the pathological process finally affects more dorsal regions with more pronounced involvement of fronto-parietotemporal fibre bundles, the full picture of PD-associated dementia becomes overt. In vivo tracing the neuropathological progression together with cognitive performance may provide further achievements on a more detailed understanding of PD-associated pathophysiology. The definition of parameters that may eventually allow for tracing and even predicting the course of PD will particularly impact the landscape of urgently required biomarkers for clinical trials. Moving forward in the field on how structural impairment shapes cognitive performance may eventually guide in the development of the yet limited therapeutic options.",

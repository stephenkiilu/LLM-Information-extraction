    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is diagnosed and staged neuropathologically by the distribution and abundance of two hallmark lesions: extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular accumulations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (Bloom, 2014). Initially Aβ plaques deposit in neocortical regions and spread to limbic and subcortical areas. Tau pathology is characterized by hyperphosphorylation and subsequent aggregation of tau into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs) (Hu et al., 2016). In multiple etiologies of AD, including autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and late onset AD (LOAD), symptomatic individuals have significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) t-tauAβ42 ratio compared to cognitively normal controls (Bateman et al., 2012). Phosphorylation of the tau protein is not a single process and in fact 70 different sites along the tau protein are known to be altered in AD. Recent work has shown that phosphorylation of tau at specific sites is associated with different stages of the disease process (Barthelemy et al., 2020a;Barthelemy et al., 2019). For example, elevations in pT205 change after pT181 and pT217, and are more strongly associated with gray matter volume. However, relationships between pT205 and white matter integrity remain unknown. Since AD pathology involves both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), we sought to determine if changes in specific Tau phosphorylation sites are associated with WM changes seen in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). Dynamic changes in p-tau can be differentiated using mass spectrometry to quantify the percentage of phosphorylation occupancy at specific sites (Barthelemy et al., 2019). Previous studies of CSF p-tau have primarily focused on p-tau 181 (pT181) due to its relative abundance and ease in quantification. Recently, additional CSF Tau phosphorylation sites (pT217, pS202, and pT205) have been identified with a temporal order of phosphorylation sites occurring with disease progression (Barron et al., 2017;Kimura et al., 2018;Shahpasand et al., 2012). Hyperphosphorylation at these sites can differ in the stoichiometry suggesting their propensity to be sequestered into brain tau tangles (pT181, pT217, pS202) or the soluble (pt205) matrix including CSF (Horie et al., 2020a). Specifically, increased percentage of phosphorylation at CSF pT181 and CSF pT217 occur earlier in disease progression and have been associated with amyloid accumulation while an increased percentage of phosphorylation at CSF pT205 occurs at symptom onset and is associated more with neurodegenerative markers (e.g. gray matter (GM) atrophy) (Kimura et al., 2018).\nTau hyperphosphorylation has been associated with not only GM but also WM decline (Musi et al., 2018). Animal studies have demonstrated that post-translational hyperphosphorylation of tau is necessary for GM and WM loss (Wang et al., 2018). Hyperphosphorylation leads to a loss of binding of tau to microtubules that is associated with demyelination. This can lead to impaired communication between local and distant brain regions (Pierpaoli et al., 1996). This process of myelinoclasis is not considered to be a byproduct of neuronal loss but rather a distinct AD-related mechanism that affects WM. These changes in WM can be detected in vivo utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a neuroimaging method that monitors the diffusion of water (Strain et al., 2018). DTI has been studied extensively in AD with loss of WM associated with increases in tau positron emission tomography (PET) (McDade et al., 2018). Prior work from our group has shown that tau PET in temporal regions is tightly coupled to WM loss in LOAD (Strain et al., 2018).\nADAD provides a unique window to evaluate WM pathology due to AD without age-related vascular contributions that are seen with LOAD (Bateman et al., 2012). In particular, ADAD individuals are often younger and do not have significant vascular burden typically seen in LOAD. Furthermore, ADAD individuals are genetically predisposed to develop symptoms at a known age with the estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) derived from other family members who have a similar mutation (McDade et al., 2018). EYO represents the conversion point when cognitive changes manifest and provides a metric of disease time that is currently unavailable in LOAD. By evaluating WM loss in relation to cognition and EYO we can derive the spatial pattern of WM loss seen in ADAD.\nThis study evaluated whether CSF phosphorylation at various tau sites (pT217, pT181, pS202, and pT205) and total tau are associated with WM loss, as quantified by DTI. The spatial topography of WM integrity loss across multiple tracts was reduced in dimensional space using principal component analysis (PCA) to derive a WM composite. This WM composite measure statistically reduces the number of comparisons but still retains spatial information. Within this composite, tracks are weighted differently depending on their contribution to the primary component. We examined the decline in WM composite with regards to EYO and cognitive changes in ADAD.",

For inclusion within this analysis, a participant completed: 1) a general physical, including neurologic examination; 2) health and medication history questionnaires; 3) a clinical assessment for dementia and neuropsychological evaluation; 4) a lumbar puncture for CSF tau; and 5) neuroimaging on a 3 T Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany).

Each variable, except CSF Tau phosphorylation site, was included as a representative potential source of variance for WM decline. Increasing age has consistently been associated with WM loss (Molloy et al., 2021). WMHs due to cerebrovascular disease are also associated with WM loss (Maillard et al., 2013). Cortical volume can serve as a proxy for neurodegeneration that occurs due to WM loss (Sintini et al., 2018). Finally, AD biomarkers (e.g. amyloid PET accumulation) has also been associated with WM loss.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "WM changes were evaluated with regards to CSF Tau phosphorylation sites, EYO, and cognition in a cohort of MC and NC within the DIAN cohort. A WM composite was derived from a PCA to create a single scalar metric for each participant. Loss within this WM composite was associated with greater phosphorylation at only CSF pT205 and not other phosphorylation sites. In particular, WM loss was primarily seen within callosal and cingulate projections. Amyloid, gray matter and percentage of phosphorylation at site T205 significantly predicted FA WM composite independent of other sources of variance. Observed loss in the WM composite occurred near EYO and was correlated with cognitive performance both globally and within specific domains (memory and executive function). These results suggest that a lower WM composite is associated with increased phosphorylation at a specific tau site and occurs relatively late in AD progression.\nThe mechanism of phosphorylation specificity that may lead to a decrease in WM integrity loss remains unclear. Hyperphosphorylation can potentially lead to both a loss-of-function via the destabilization of microtubules (Feinstein and Wilson, 2005) structures or a toxicgain-of function that can influence mitochondrial function (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016;Hoover et al., 2010;Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2011). Our data support the former given the strong association between hyperphosphorylation of T205 and WM decline. Although more work is necessary to understand the mechanism suggested here between pT205 and WM some distinctions can be made about this particular tau species. The ratio of phosphorylation at pT205 elevates around the time of clinical onset which is distinct from pT181 and pT217, which start to increase at the preclinical stage and can decline after onset (Horie et al., 2020b;Barthelemy et al., 2020b;Janelidze et al., 2020). Besides this temporal discrepancy, recent work from our colleagues has shown that different p-tau species can have different stoichiometry with regards to insoluble versus soluble state (Horie et al., 2020b). In that seminal paper, phosphorylated tau at pT181, pT217 and especially pS202 were more likely to be insoluble than soluble tau with an insoluble fraction of 30-60. This implies that these p-tau species have higher propensity to be sequestered into insoluble tau. In contrast, pT205 had an insoluble fraction of approximately only 2 in the AD brain. Moreover, significant hyperphosphorylation of T205 found in AD soluble brain extract and CSF indicated only partial deposition of this species into tau aggregates even after AD onset, suggesting the continuous increase of pT205 in CSF along with the WM composite.\nTau phosphorylation alone did not predict WM decline as the presence of both amyloid and tau were significant predictors of WM burden (Mitew et al., 2010). In animal models of AD, increasing amyloid plaque load is associated with greater accumulation of phosphorylated T205 tau suggesting that amyloid plaques are a prerequisite for phosphorylation of tau at this site (Davila-Bouziguet et al., 2019). Furthermore, treatment interventions focused on removing amyloid plaque also reduce pT205 suggesting that amyloid may mediate Tau phosphorylation at this particular site (Barthelemy et al., 2020a). Prior work has also shown that pyroglutamate Aß, which is more associated with AD that other Aß variants (Prelli et al., 1988), is associated with memory decline (Sofola-Adesakin et al., 2016;Moro et al., 2018) and predicts pT205. In this study the presence of abnormalities in both amyloid and tau predicted WM loss, solidifying that pT205 is a strong candidate for the observed structural alterations seen in AD (Neddens et al., 2018).\nFractional anisotropy was the main DTI metric studied but disruption of this metric is driven by an imbalance of diffusion perpendicular to the axon (DR). An increase in DR can translate to a breakdown of hydrophobic properties of myelin. This predominantly reflects demyelination which suggest an underlying mechanism for observed WM decline. Although our data suggests that demyelination may be the underlying factor for observed changes in white matter, additional studies using advanced sequences that parcellate diffusion coefficient are needed. Understanding the relationship between WM loss and specific CSF Tau phosphorylation sites are important for deciphering the disease progression of AD and may facilitate the development of specific therapeutics.\nOf the three post-translational mechanisms associated with AD, hyperphosphorylation of CSF tau is commonly linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline (Wang et al., 2013).\nIn the current study only CSF pT205 was associated with WM composite loss. Recent work by our colleagues has shown that changes in CSF pT205 occur later in the disease process and coincide with the presence of NFTs (Mondragon-Rodriguez et al., 2014;Hoover et al., 2010;Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2011;Horie et al., 2020b;Barthelemy et al., 2020b;Janelidze et al., 2020;Mitew et al., 2010;Davila-Bouziguet et al., 2019;Prelli et al., 1988;Sofola-Adesakin et al., 2016;Moro et al., 2018;Neddens et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2013). When defined by the Braak stages pT205 is focally present in the hippocampus at Braak stage IIIIV but disseminates to the temporal and cingulate cortices at later stages (VVI) (Neddens et al., 2018). Our current findings are consistent with previous work as reductions in WM composite were seen near symptom onset and correlated with cognitive loss. The exact mechanism remains unknown but increases in pT205 could be initially protective due to the toxic environment (Devos and Hymen, 2017) but continued overexpression could cause axonal dysfunction (Kanaan et al., 2011). Additional longitudinal studies using WM composites are needed to support its application as a useful biomarker in later stages of AD. Furthermore, comparative studies in other disease models, including early-onset AD (EOAD), are needed to determine if a similar underlying mechanism is present in other younger affected populations.\nThe current results suggest that AD affects both gray matter (GM) and WM. Prior work by our colleagues have shown the changes in pT205 are associated with GM atrophy in AD individuals (Barthelemy et al., 2019). However, WM changes are also prominent in ADAD, who are younger and lack vascular comorbidities that are typically observed in LOAD cohorts. In a separate group of LOAD individuals we have shown that WM changes were associated with changes in regional tau PET (Strain et al., 2018). The current findings expand on this concept implicating that specific Tau phosphorylation sites may mediate WM changes. After including GM atrophy into our model CSF pT205 remained a significant predictor of WM composite loss suggesting WM loss not exclusively attributed to gray matter atrophy in ADAD. While our approach focused on generalized atrophy, similar results were seen when concentrating on local GM changes (e.g. precuneus). These findings suggest a WM specific mechanism occur in ADAD.\nThe spatial topography of the loss in the WM composite was specific for ADAD. Previous studies of LOAD have observed WM changes primarily within the temporal lobe and were associated with tau pathology (Strain et al., 2018). In ADAD, tau accumulation occurs earliest within posterior portions of the brain, especially the precuneus (Gordon et al., 2019). The primary WM pathways that contributed to WM composite loss included callosal tracts. This topography suggests that changes in posterior WM may be crucial for disease progression in ADAD. Further longitudinal studies of ADAD individuals are needed to identify additional areas that are subsequently susceptible to disease. The observed topography and lack of association with other CSF tau phosphorylated sites supports the concept that WM loss is not only spatially specific but site-specific for Tau phosphorylation.\nThere are several limitations to the current study. We focused on a subset of phosphorylation sites within a well characterized cohort of individuals with ADAD. As the technique for identifying the percentage of phosphorylation at specific sites improves, additional studies that focus on the combination of Tau phosphorylation sites that best associate with loss of WM integrity. This study was the first to incorporate DTI and other imaging modalities with CSF Tau phosphorylation sites but did not include other biofluid information (e.g. inflammation or metabolic factors). Future studies are needed to examine additional mechanisms that may be involved in WM decline associated with specific Tau phosphorylation sites. CSF analyses by its nature quantifies soluble tau species and is unlikely a direct measure of intracellular tau aggregation. Additional longitudinal studies of WM integrity are needed to more robustly evaluate the nature of neuronal dysfunction with disease progression. Finally, ADAD believe to be an excellent model for evaluating AD progression as EYO is known. However, differences exist between ADAD and LOAD. Future studies are needed to confirm if these results are applicable to LOAD.\nIn summary, this study evaluated the role of white matter integrity loss in association with specific CSF Tau phosphorylation sites in ADAD. We identified a WM composite that was significantly different in MC compared to NC. The spatial topography of WM loss included the callosum and cingulate. Observed WM composite loss occurred near symptom onset (EYO 0) and were associated with global and domain specific cognitive decline and appeared to be facilitated by the presence of both amyloid accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of tau at a specific site.\nHigh-Performance Computing, and the Central Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA)Neuroimaging Informatics and Analysis Center (NIAC) (1P30NS098577, R01 EB009352).

Table 2 p-values for each variable and their contribution to the linear models for each of the CSF Tau phosphorylation sites. Each variable is attributed to a known cause of WM decline with amyloid as a metric of disease severity and cortical GM as a proxy for GM atrophy. Only CSF pT205 significantly contributed to the model with a trend level seen for CSF pT217.",

    "abstract": "White matter lesions induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion are associated with cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VaD). Previous studies have shown that acupuncture can ameliorate the cognitive deficits of individuals with VaD. However, the neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on white matter perfusion and integrity remain elusive. In this study, the VaD model was induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO) in rats. Novel object recognition task and Morris water maze were performed to evaluate short-term memory and spatial learning and memory. Arterial spin labeling and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the white matter integrity. Pathological examinations detected the myelin loss and concomitant neuroinflammation. The results demonstrate that BCCAO rats with reduced CBF exhibited worse performance and altered DTI parameters, including decreased fractional anisotropy, increased radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity in white matter regions. Acupuncture ameliorated cognitive impairment, increased CBF, and protected the myelin sheath integrity but not the axons of BCCAO rats. These protective effects of acupuncture on white matter were significantly correlated with improved CBF. Pathological examination confirmed that the loss of myelin basic protein and microglial accumulation associated IL-1β and IL-6 production were attenuated by acupuncture treatment. Our findings suggest that acupuncture protects cognitive function of BCCAO rats by improving white matter perfusion and integrity.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimers disease (Gorelick et al., 2011). VaD is characterized by hemodynamic alterations, including persistent cerebral blood flow (CBF) attenuation and dysfunction of CBF regulation (Giezendanner et al., 2016;Ogoh, 2017). The circulatory abnormalities are mainly attributed to the aging vasculature failing to cope with biological demands, which results in subcortical ischemia and white matter lesions (Alber et al., 2019). Ample evidence suggests that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a leading pathophysiological mechanism of white matter lesions in VaD (Iadecola, 2013;Dichgans and Leys, 2017;Alber et al., 2019). Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia induced by CCH is sufficient to trigger white matter inflammation and oxidative stress (Dong et al., 2011;Miyamoto et al., 2013), which, in turn, impact the regulation of the cerebral blood supply (Faraci, 2011;Iadecola, 2013). Such an imbalance of CBF regulation would aggravate white matter injury and contribute to the loss of working memory or executive dysfunction (Calabrese et al., 2016;Du et al., 2017).\nWhite matter is a subcortical structure that consists of neuronal axons, the myelin sheath, and the surrounding glial cells. Due to the deep location at non-overlapping regions of cerebral arterioles or capillaries, white matter is vulnerable to the CBF reductions (Wang et al., 2020). White matter lesions caused by ischemia, encompassing axonal damage, loss of myelinassociated glycoproteins, and microglial activation, are common pathological changes in VaD (Struys et al., 2017;Qin et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study reports that VaD patients have a specific pattern of white matter lesions affecting the thalamic radiations or corpus callosum (CC) to a greater extent (Fu et al., 2012;Palesi et al., 2018), which appears as decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), increased radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) (Choi et al., 2016;Ben-Ari et al., 2019). Further perfusion imaging studies demonstrate that VaD patients develop white matter lesions associated with persistent reduction of parenchymal CBF (Schuff et al., 2009), which remains at 50 of the baseline level for at least 2 weeks (Hattori et al., 2016).\nAcupuncture is a non-pharmacologic therapy of traditional Chinese medicine that originated from ancient clinical practice. It is performed at stimulation points or meridians spread over the surface of body and within many organs (Adams et al., 2011). Clinical studies confirm that VaD patients treated with acupuncture exhibit improvement of cognitive status (memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability), and the restored cortical CBF might underlie the therapeutic effects (Yu et al., 2006;Shi et al., 2014;Uchida and Kagitani, 2015). It has been shown that the beneficial effect of acupuncture on CBF is associated with promotion of the cholinergic vasodilative system or suppression of oxidative stress in the cortex of rats (Zhang et al., 2014;Uchida and Kagitani, 2015). Although this research investigated the role of acupuncture in cortical blood flow and cognitive performance microscopically, the role of neuroimaging mechanism of acupuncture in white matter perfusion and structural integrity has not been delineated.\nIn this study, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL) to monitor CBF changes in the CC and external capsule (EC) in rats with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and acupuncture treatment. White matter lesions in the CC, EC, internal capsule (IC), optic tract (OT), and optic nerves (ON) were detected by DTI to evaluate the disruption of white matter integrity. Additionally, pathological changes in white matter and expression levels of neuroinflammatory markers were also analyzed to validate the features of myelin loss and inflammatory responses.",

Food and water were available ad libitum for the rats. The rats were randomized into five groups by a digital table (Figure 1A): sham-operated rats (SHAM, n  8), rats subjected to BCCAO (BCCAO, n  8), SHAM rats treated with acupuncture (SHAM  ACU, n  8), BCCAO rats treated with acupuncture (BCCAO  ACU, n  8), and BCCAO rats treated with non-acupoint acupuncture (BCCAO  NON-ACU, n  8). Surgery caused one blindness, and the mortality rate was 4. The rat blinded due to surgery, as well as two BCCAO-operated rats without impairment of working memory that was validated by behavioral tests, were not included in the experiment.

The selection of acupoints was based on our previous study in VaD rats, which suggests that the combination of GV20  ST36 has better attenuating effects on cognitive dysfunction (Ye et al., 2017). For the BCCAO  NON-ACU group, bilateral non-acupoints (on the bilateral hypochondrium, 10 mm above the iliac crest) were chosen as the insertion site (Figure 1A). The needles were retained for 15 min before removal. The same catching-grasping stimulation used for the BCCAO  ACU group was used for all the other nontreatment groups.",

On the contrary, 56  3 preference for new location of object in BCCAO rats, compared with 67  2 preference in the SHAM group (p  0.017), indicates failing memorization. After acupuncture treatment, the preference for the novel object was increased to 67  2 compared with BCCAO rats (p  0.021), suggesting that the short-term memory is restored. However, acupuncture at non-acupoints was not sufficient to increase the time of exploring novel subject for BCCAO rats (p  0.05). In addition, there was no effect of acupuncture treatment on behavioral performance of sham-operated rats (p  0.05).\nThen we performed the MWM to examine spatial learning and memory (Figures 1D-G).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, our results demonstrate that spatial learning and memory of BCCAO rats could be ameliorated by acupuncture treatment, as evidenced by increased white matter perfusion and integrity. In CC and EC, where the white matter fibers are the most abundant, white matter integrity is correlated with the alteration of CBF. Pathological evidence suggests that the attenuated myelin loss and neuroinflammation partially underlie the beneficial effects of acupuncture on white matter.\nAcupoints selection and the course of treatment are key factors that affect the effectiveness of acupuncture. In the current study, GV20 and ST36 were selected, based on our published results, as an ideal combination of acupoints that is beneficial to memory deficits in BCCAO rats (Ye et al., 2017;Xiao et al., 2018). For the course of treatment, outpatients usually take regular rest weekly during the acupuncture. For this reason, a one-day break every 2 weeks is supposed to be consistent with the clinical practice.\nPreliminary research provides some clues that the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on visceral function may be mediated by specific peripheral nerves. For example, GV20 is located at the area of trigeminal nerve innervating (Wang et al., 2017), by which the signal of acupuncture stimulation might be transferred to the meninges or brainstem nucleus. For ST36, there is less strong evidence suggesting a direct anatomic connection between the acupoint and brain. But the sciatic nerve is supposed to be a peripheral structure mediating the acupuncture signals from ST36 to the spinal cord, the nucleus tractus solitary and higher center (Torres-Rosas et al., 2014). Although acupuncture at nonacupoints is an invasive stimulation, there is no obvious effect of non-acupoints on animal behavior and white matter pathology in this study. Based on the neuroanatomical evidence, we presume that (1) non-acupoints location are far away from the main trunk of the nerve, and the stimulus signal may not be transduced to the central nerve system successfully (no effect); and (2) the signal derived from acupuncture stimulation at non-acupoint could be transferred to the spinal cord or brain. Nevertheless, they may not be effective acupoints for cognitive dysfunction (non-specific effect).\nLarge number of studies suggest that spatial learning and memory are impaired in BCCAO rats (Choi et al., 2016;Du et al., 2017;Qin et al., 2018). As a peripheral stimulation, acupuncture could improve the performance of BCCAO rodents in MWM by increasing the CBF velocity and volume of prefrontal lobe and hippocampus (Wang et al., 2015;Ding et al., 2019). Consistent with previous studies, we found that BCCAO rats with increased escape latency and decreased time in target quadrant in probe trials showed reduced white matter CBF. In contrast, rats treated with 2-week acupuncture had better MWM performance and white matter perfusion. These outcomes indicate that acupuncture can improve cognitive dysfunction of VaD rats by increasing the white matter CBF. Diffusion tensor imaging is a sensitive MRI technique that could highlight the changes in white matter microstructure in terms of diffusion properties of tissue in vivo (Palesi et al., 2018). FA and MD represent the white matter organization in general, while RD and AD reflect quality of the myelin sheath and the axon integrity, respectively (Alfaro et al., 2018). Human study indicates that subcortical VaD patients exhibit decreased FA and increased MD in all white matter regions except occipital areas (Kim et al., 2015). But the DTI parameters reported in rats show more heterogeneity, characterized by remarkable alteration of FA, RD, and AD in ON, OT, and EC 2 weeks after BCCAO, or significant reductions in MD, RD, and AD in CC and EC 5 weeks after surgery (Wang et al., 2015;Choi et al., 2016). We combined ASL with DTI and found that predominant reduction in CBF volume is correlated with significant white matter disintegration at 2 weeks after surgery and appears as lower FA and higher RD values in white matter regions, which are in line with previous studies. After acupuncture treatment, FA, RD, and white matter perfusion are significantly ameliorated. Therefore, we conclude that compromised myelin sheath but not neuroaxonal damage could be helped by acupuncture.\nVisualizing results explained the specific changes in DTI parameters. In this part, we produced quantitative analysis of white matter structure based on previous study, which suggests the remarkable decreased fiber density and fiber length 4 weeks after BCCAO (Choi et al., 2016). However, only contrasting changes in fiber density, but not fiber length in four groups, were observed, indicating that the wrapped myelin sheath is damaged by ischemia, while neuroaxon structure is still intact. Given that the MRI acquisition was arranged at the 13th day after surgery, we speculate that the axon had not been attacked by hypoperfusion. Taken together, our diffusion imaging outcomes prove in part that acupuncture treatment protects myelin sheath integrity from CCH in rats with subcortical white matter lesions.\nIt has been suggested that glia-associated neuroinflammatory response aggravates the white matter lesions (Sharma et al., 2010;Datta et al., 2017). In BCCAO rats, both microglia and astrocyte activation contribute to the white matter demyelination (Choi et al., 2016;Saggu et al., 2016). We observed the specific pathological changes in the white matter to evaluate the demyelination and neuroinflammation. In alignment with the DTI results, our findings suggest that the disintegration of white matter, represented by loss of myelin sheath and microglial accumulation-mediated neuroinflammation, could be halted by acupuncture treatment. It is worth noting that astrogliosis was not significant in this study. According to the previous accomplishment, astrocyte activation could lead to the increased neuroinflammatory response and white matter lesions in CCH rats (Saggu et al., 2016). This might be attributed to the different chronic hypoperfusion model, bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, that was used in that experiment. Although we did not observe the astrocyte activation, our study does not rule out the possibility that astrocyte plays a crucial role in the protective effect of acupuncture in white matter lesions. Therefore, further work needs to be done to elucidate the glia-associated neural circuits that acupuncture may regulate in BCCAO-induced CCH rats.\nSeveral limitations need to be considered when explaining our results. First, both behavioral tests and pathological examination were performed in the same cohort of rats. Our data cannot exclude the bias that the stress induced by forcing swimming in MWM may result in unpredictable effects on NORT performance and pathological damage. Second, no functional MRI was conducted in this study. It is widely accepted that subcortical white matter structure underlies the neuronal activity in the cortex (Reijmer et al., 2015). The white matter abnormality may result in the decreased functional connectivity or the rearrangement of local cognitive networks. Previous studies prove that these functional networks could be considered neuroimaging evidence of acupuncture effects on cognitive function (Dhond et al., 2008;Qiu et al., 2010;Cui et al., 2018;Wen et al., 2018). Therefore, future studies aiming at structure and function changes and their interaction will help uncover the mechanism of acupuncture. Third, since this is an imaging study, we focused mainly on the macroscopic changes of brain and did not assume and detect signaling pathways mediating the white matter lesions and microglial activation. In fact, microglial polarization mediated inflammatory and complement pathways contribute to white matter lesions in the VaD model (Qin et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, the downstream mechanism needs to be addressed in future studies as a next step to clarify the molecular target of acupuncture.\nIn summary, the present study reveals that acupuncture protects short-term memory and spatial and learning memory of BCCAO rats through increasing subcortical white matter perfusion and improving white matter integrity. The attenuation of myelin loss and microglia-associated neuroinflammation in part underlies the beneficial effects of acupuncture on white matter lesions. Intensive studies of downstream neural circuits that mediate the stimulating signals are encouraged to confirm the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in VaD.",

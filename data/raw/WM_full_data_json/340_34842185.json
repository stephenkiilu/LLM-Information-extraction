    "abstract": "Background-Imaging biomarkers are increasingly used in Alzheimers disease (AD), and the identification of sex differences using neuroimaging may provide insight into disease heterogeneity, progression, and therapeutic targets. Objective-The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in grey matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) microstructural disorganization between males and females with AD using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and free-water-corrected diffusion tensor imaging (FW-DTI). Methods-Data were downloaded from the OASIS-3 database, including 158 healthy control (HC; 86 females) and 46 mild AD subjects (24 females). VBM and FW-DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities (AxD and RD, respectively), and FW index) were compared using effect size for the main effects of group, sex, and their interaction. Results-Significant group and sex differences were observed, with no significant interaction. Post-hoc comparisons showed that AD is associated with reduced GM volume, reduced FW-FA, and higher FW-RDFW-index, consistent with neurodegeneration. Females in both groups exhibited higher GM volume than males, while FW-DTI metrics showed sex differences only in the AD group. Lower FW, lower FW-FA and higher FW-RD were observed in females relative to males in the AD group. Conclusion- The combination of VBM and DTI may reveal complementary sex-specific changes in GM and WM associated with AD and aging. Sex differences in GM volume were observed for both groups, while FW-DTI metrics only showed significant sex differences in the AD group, suggesting that WM tract disorganization may play a differential role in AD pathophysiology between females and males.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in elderly people and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) within the brain, along with hyperphosphorylated tau. AD is significantly more common in women than in men; in the United States, the estimated AD incidence is split approximately 2:1 between women and men, respectively 1. Numerous population-based studies have examined sex differences in AD, with some reporting a higher incidence of AD among females 2,3 while others have reported no such differences 4,5. Early explanations of observed sex differences hypothesized that differential life expectancy between men and women was a contributing factor 3; other explanations have indicated possible protective factors in males, including a higher synaptic density, greater number of neurons, and larger brain size, that might partially explain why males seem to have a greater defense against pathology translating into clinical symptoms of AD 6,7. Alternatively, some studies have indicated that females may have higher cognitive resilience, as well as stronger memory abilities, leading to later diagnosis and faster apparent decline 891011. While some studies have suggested that people with larger intracranial volume are less likely to develop AD 12, current evidence suggests that intracranial volume does not contribute to so-called cognitive reserve 13.\nSex differences in aging and AD have been documented in epidemiological 14, clinicopathological 15, and, more recently, imaging studies 15,16. Imaging-based biomarkers using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide a window into the aging brain and how the brain changes in males and females with both healthy aging and AD. Similar to findings from post-mortem histopathology 17, studies using Aβ PET tracers, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, have largely shown a lack of clear sex differences in both cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals 181920. On the other hand, tau biomarkers of AD pathology, which are more closely related to cognitive decline, have shown sex differences 2,17,19; moreover, observed sex differences in tau biomarkers may be modified directly or indirectly by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype andor Aβ levels 212223. Global and regional brain atrophy, as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, can be assessed using highresolution structural MRI, with some studies finding sex differences in healthy subjects 20,24 and in subjects with AD 19,24,25. However, these findings related to brain atrophy have been largely inconsistent, which may be attributable to methods for correcting (or normalizing) for head-size and not to true sexual dimorphism 26.\nMore advanced MRI methods show particular promise for assessing both brain structure and microstructure. For example, subtle structural changes in grey matter (GM) volume, indicative of neurodegeneration, can be assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with high-resolution anatomical MR images 27; importantly, this voxel-wise approach minimizes confounding differences in intracranial volume (ICV) 28. A complementary method, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is a powerful tool for assessing white matter (WM) microstructural changes in vivo. Using DTI, the location, orientation, and anisotropy of the brains WM tracts can be estimated 29. Both VBM and DTI have been used in AD and early-AD prodromes as biomarkers of GM volume 30313233, respectively. In addition to group differences with aging and AD, VBM has revealed unique sex-specific patterns in age-related GM changes in a healthy aging cohort 35. Previous studies have also investigated sexual dimorphism using microstructural DTI biomarkers in young healthy subjects 36 and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 37. In the MCI cohort, ODwyer et al. showed a significant main effect of sex for DTI metrics, where male HC and MCI subjects showed significantly more microstructural damage than their female counterparts 37. However, to our knowledge, VBM and DTI have not been previously employed together to study sex differences between HC and patients with AD.\nAlthough DTI is widely used, it is well recognized that there are potential limitations of this technique. One such limitation of DTI involves inaccuracies associated with partial volume effects (PVEs), wherein DTI metrics reflect a weighted average of multiple diffusion components within a voxel rather than characteristics specific to a single tissue type 38. This limitation may be particularly important in AD where neuronal loss leads to secondary ex vacuo increases in CSF and free water (FW) content across the brain. To minimize this effect, FW-correction algorithms can be implemented 39 and have been shown to improve the accuracy of the resulting DTI metrics in aging populations 40.\nIn this study, we employed VBM and DTI to investigate differences in GM volumes and WM disorganization between males and females in mild AD and healthy aging subjects. All MRI data were downloaded from the OASIS-3 database (http:oasis-brains.org), which is a freely available neuroimaging dataset for normal aging and AD. To overcome DTI limitations related to PVEs, a FW correction algorithm was used to quantify and remove the contribution of extracellular FW to DTI data (FW-DTI) 39. We subsequently quantified differences in GM volumes and WM disorganization between males and females in AD using VBM and FW-DTI. As imaging biomarkers are increasingly used in AD, the identification of sex-specific radiological phenotypes may provide insight into disease heterogeneity, progression, and novel therapeutic targets, thus offering a more patientcentered approach for the clinical management of AD.",

The total number of subjects included in this study were as follows: 158 healthy controls (HC, 86 females and 72 males with a mean age (standard deviation; S.D.) of 71 (8) and 70 (7) years, respectively) and 46 mild AD, as defined clinically and characterized by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 41, (24 females and 22 males with a mean age (S.D.) of 73 (7) and 74 (6) years, respectively). Inclusion criteria for all participants were availability of 3-Tesla structural T1-weighted images and DTI data with 64 directions. For each subject, only one time-point was used for analysis. All subjects completed the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 42 and the CDR test 43. The MMSE is a 30-point assessment commonly used to measure cognitive impairment, while the CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize multiple domains of cognitive and functional abilities. The mean value of MMSE was 29.3 (S.D. 1.0) for HC and 26.1 (S.D. 4.4) for AD. The mean CDR values for HC and AD were 0 and 0.69 (S.D. 0.46), respectively.

DTI acquisition was performed using 64 diffusion-encoding directions with the following parameters: b  1000 smm 2 ; TRTE: 1100087.0 ms; flip-angle  90; matrix: 96  96; field of view (FOV): 24.0  24.0 cm 2 ; slice thickness: 2.5 mm; 64 axial slices and one nondiffusion-weighted image (B0 image).

Brain extraction was performed using ROBEX 46 before proceeding with the FSL-VBM pipeline, through which the study-specific GM template was then created via non-linear registration. Finally, all GM images were non-linearly registered to the template and concatenated into a 4D image that was smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma, 3 mm).

      "text": "DTI pre-processing was performed by Mrtrix3 47, FSL 45, and ANTs (http: stnava.github.ioANTs). The preprocessing included denoising (dwidenoise 48), eddy current and motion corrections (eddy 49), and bias field correction (dwibiascorrect 50). The eddy quality control tools were used to evaluate the quality of the DTI dataset 51. Slices with signal loss caused by subject movement coinciding with the diffusion encoding were detected and replaced by predictions from a Gaussian process 52 (for this dataset, the mean of the total outliers was 0.36). Subjects with total outliers greater than 5 andor an average absolute volume-to-volume head motion greater than 3 mm were removed. Skull stripping involved a multi-step procedure, as follows. Initially, brain extraction was performed on the B0 images using dwi2mask 53; subsequently, this brain extraction was linearly coregistered to the MNI 1mm B0 image using the FMRIB linear image registration tool (FLIRT) with an affine model 54. Finally, the coregistration matrix was inverted and applied to the MNI 1mm mask to obtain the brain mask for each native B0 image and thus the final B0 brain extractions. Subsequently, standard fractional anisotropy (FA), FWcorrected FA (FW-FA), FW-corrected axial and radial diffusivity (FW-AxD and FW-RD, respectively), and FW index were calculated in native space using an in-house MATLAB script 39,55. All brain-extracted B0 images were used to create a group-wise template using ANTs software. The group template was subsequently non-linearly normalized to the MNI 1-mm space by the ANTs symmetric image normalization (SyN) algorithm 56. To run voxel-based analysis, all DTI metrics were non-linearly coregistered to the group-wise template and then to the MNI standard space using ANTs. Both FW-FA and FW metrics in MNI space were then smoothed using FSL with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma, 3 mm). A binary WM mask was created from the averaged standard FA maps from all subjects by using a threshold of 0.2. To minimize PVEs, the final WM mask consisted only of voxels that were nonzero for all subjects.",

Age, MMSE, and CDR scores are presented as mean and S.D. for each group and sub-group. Differences in age and education were evaluated using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Cognitive test score differences were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test. Pairwise comparisons across all subjects for the cognitive tests were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test with the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.\nBecause the number of subjects and male-to-female ratio within each group (AD and HC) differed, imaging results are reported as effect-size which was analyzed at the voxelbased level. For both VBM and DTI analyses, a two-way ANCOVA model (with age, ICV, and education as covariates) was performed using an in-house R script (http:www.Rproject.org) to calculate the partial-eta squared (η p 2 ) for the main effects of sex and group and for their interaction at the voxel-based level. Post-hoc comparisons between sex and group were assessed using the Hedges g effect-size.\nFor ANCOVA, η p 2  0.06was considered to be a medium effect size and η p 2  0.14 was considered to be a large effect size; for post-hoc comparisons, g0.50 was considered to be a medium effect size and g0.80 was considered to be a large effect size 57. The cluster extent size was determined for each comparison using 3dClustSim (AFNI), following estimation of the spatial auto-correlation function (ACF) using 3dFWHMx (AFNI). The minimum cluster sizes across post-hoc comparisons for each parameter ranged from 115 voxels for RD to 418 voxels for VBM (AxD,FA,and FW: 117,142,and 171 voxels,respectively). The resulting clusters were labeled according to the JHU DTI-based whitematter atlases for DTI 58,59 and to the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases 60, with the probabilistic atlas of the human cerebellum 61 used for VBM.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we analyzed the differences in GM volume and WM structural disorganization between males and females in healthy aging and mild AD cohorts. For this purpose, we used two complementary MRI techniques: VBM (for GM volume) and DTI (for WM disorganization via FW-FA, FW-AxD, FW-RD, and FW index). As standard DTI has limitations associated with PVEs 38, we applied an algorithm to correct for FW effects 39. Using ANCOVA analysis, we found large differences for the main effect of group, as expected, and significant differences for the main effect of sex, though no significant group-by-sex interaction was observed in this dataset.\nFor both males and females, we found regionally lower GM volumes, higher FW index, lower FW-FA, both higher and lower FW-AxD, and higher FW-RD in the AD group compared to HC. Using VBM, GM volume changes were observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala. These findings are consistent with previous VBM studies in AD 30,62, as well as with known AD neuropathological patterns 63,64. Consistent with our results, several studies have shown that AD cohorts have significantly higher FW than HC cohorts 40,656667, and FW corrected metrics may be more accurate in aging cohorts 40.\nAdditionally, the FW index has been associated with CSF AD biomarkers 68 and may predict cognitive decline 67. Lower FW-FA, and higher FW-AxD and FW-RD, are also consistent with neurodegenerative mechanisms. For FW-DTI, large differences were found in the CC and fornix. Notably, several studies have reported significant atrophy of the CC in AD 697071, and progression of clinical disease severity has been correlated with atrophy of the CC 72. The fornix carries afferent fibers to the hippocampus 73 and is critical for episodic memory function 74. In this study, we found large clusters of differences between AD and HC in the fornix (FW index covered 97, FW-FA covered 94, FW-AxD covered 77, and FW-RD covered 56 of the fornix) that are in line with other studies 75. Overall, the structures showing both group and sex differences in this study are largely consistent with AD-related pathology and with prior studies.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess sex differences in AD using both VBM and FW-DTI. In this study, post-hoc comparisons showed significant sex differences in GM volumes in both AD and HC groups, with females showing primarily higher GM volumes than males. Significantly larger GM volume in females was previously observed using VBM in young healthy adults, particularly in the pars opercularis and inferior parietal lobule 76. Previous studies have also considered sex differences using standard DTI. Menzler et al. showed that young healthy males had significantly higher FA and lower RD in the thalamus, CC, and cingulum than young females 36. In contrast, another study found that females had higher FA in the CC, while males had higher FA in cerebellar WM and in the left SLF 77. In terms of aging, whole-brain FA has been negatively correlated with age, with females showing significantly lower FA in the right deep temporal regions relative to males 78. To investigate sexual dimorphism in MCI, ODwyer et al. analyzed differences in WM tracts using standard DTI between males and females in MCI and healthy older participants 37. In that study, a significant main effect of sex was reported for FA and RD, with males of both groups showing significantly more microstructural change than female participants, with no interaction reported between sex and group. These results are consistent with the present study, where we found significant sex differences for FW-DTI for the AD group; more specifically, we found lower FW index, lower FW-FA and higher FW-RD in females than in males in the AD group, which is generally consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, the HC group showed no sex differences in FW-DTI (large effect-size) and minimal differences at a lower effect-size.\nSex differences are increasingly recognized as a factor in the care and management of patients with AD. Emerging evidence suggests that males and females exhibit unique patterns in disease manifestation and cognitive decline (with females exhibiting faster decline 79,80), as well as behavioral and psychiatric symptoms (with males exhibiting more aggressive behaviors 81 and females experiencing more mood disorders 82). Sex differences have previously been reported in cognitive profiles, where studies show that cognitively normal females have higher performance on verbal memory and males have higher visuospatial scores 15,16,83. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that females have higher cognitive resilience that enables preservation of cognitive function despite increasing AD biomarker abnormalities 8, including volumetric 23, metabolic 9, 10, and Aβ 84 changes. At some point, the pathological burden overcomes any advantage in cognitive resilience, which is supported by clinical studies showing that females progress faster after diagnosis 80,85, with lower cognitive performance compared to males at the same clinical stage 86,87, and by postmortem studies showing females have higher levels of AD pathology than males at similar levels of clinical impairment 17. As such, standard cut-off values for clinical assessments may be insensitive to subtle changes in cognition in females 8,17, and sex-specific normative data may improve diagnostic accuracy 11,85, particularly for MCI. Relatedly, the majority of neuroimaging studies in AD have grouped subjects on the basis of diagnostic category, with age andor sex included as covariates; consequently, there are limited reports of sex differences using neuroimaging biomarkers 15. Additionally, sex differences in regional brain volumes have been largely inconsistent, though longitudinal imaging studies have more consistently shown that females experience higher annual rates of atrophy than males 88,89.\nRecent studies using more advanced biomarkers of metabolism and functional connectivity have revealed sex differences in cognitively intact older adults with subjective memory complaints 90; more specifically, males showed higher Aβ load, lower metabolism, and lower connectivity in AD-implicated regions. Males with AD have similarly shown lower connectivity compared to females 91, while higher metabolism in females has been associated with cognitive resilience 9. In the present study, male and female healthy aging and AD cohorts were compared using advanced structural and microstructural biomarkers with complementary sensitivities to GM and WM, respectively. We found that females and males showed similar regional results between female HC and AD and between male HC and AD. Interestingly, the group comparison in females showed more GM volume changes in the cerebellum, while males had minimal cerebellar changes.\nIn this study, we found that AD is associated with lower GM volume, higher FW index, lower FW-FA, and higher FW-RD, all of which are likely indicative of neurodegeneration.\nAlthough females are disproportionately affected by AD, females in both groups exhibited higher GM volume than males. This difference was larger in the AD group relative to the HC group, which may suggest that GM volume is not a strong factor in the higher incidence of AD in females. Alternatively, this finding may support the hypothesis of increased cognitive reserve in males 90, though further study is needed to verify this premise. Additionally, females in the AD group showed lower FW index than males in only a few small, isolated clusters, which further suggests that primary neurodegenerative mechanisms may not differ between males and females. In contrast, lower FW-FA was observed in females relative to males in the AD group, including in large clusters covering the pontine crossing tract, cerebral peduncle, and the left PLIC. These findings suggest that FA as a biomarker of WM tract disorganization may be reflected in the disproportionate incidence rates of AD between females and males.\nThe underlying mechanisms that lead to sex differences in both healthy aging and AD cohorts are multifactorial. Studies have shown that sex differences in the brain begin early in development, and the impact of sex hormones over the lifespan is likely a major contributing factor 92,93. Additionally, a range of environmental and lifestyle factors may further contribute to these differences. For example, males are more likely to have adverse health factors, such as smoking, alcohol use, and hypertension, but are also more likely to have attained higher education levels in older cohorts due to generational and gender-specific factors 15,90. Genetic factors such as APOE genotype may also play a role in sex differences, both as a primary factor and as a secondary modulator 93,94. More recent evidence has shown that tau levels are increased in female APOE-ε4 carriers, but that this difference may be related to testosterone levels, where higher testosterone is associated with lower tau in both sexes 95. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted role of sex differences in aging and AD, and more studies are needed to ascertain the impact of sexand gender-specific factors on neuroimaging biomarkers.\nFinally, the concept of sexual dimorphism in the human brain is not without controversy 96,97. In healthy subjects, the predominant neuroimaging sex difference is the well-accepted difference in brain size (males  females), which may lead to perceived differences in volumetric and connectivity measures. However, a recent review of decades of MRI data found limited evidence of sex differences after accounting for brain volume 96. This is consistent with the findings of the present study, where the HC cohort showed almost no sex differences at large effect size (small clusters were observed with VBM, while no clusters survived for any FW-DTI metrics). Interestingly, the presence of sex differences in the AD cohort is juxtaposed with a lack of sex differences in the HC cohort, which could be indicative of overlooked sex-specific pathophysiology in AD. However, further studies are warranted to verify these findings in larger independent cohorts. Until then, caution is warranted in the interpretation of these observed sex differences in AD.\nThere are a few limitations in this study. The first limitation relates to potential contributing factors that could not be accounted for; more specifically, we did not have information related to genetic and environmental risk factors. As these factors may contribute further to sex differences, future studies should include these factors. The second limitation is that the number of subjects within each group was not matched. As Table 1 shows, the number of HC subjects was higher than the number of AD subjects. Since standard statistical testing (e.g., t-test) and, more specifically, p-values are strongly affected by the sample size of a study, we used the effect-size for both ANCOVA and post-hoc comparisons to overcome this limitation. More specifically, effect size is a quantitative measure of the difference between two or more groups 98. The final limitation is related to DTI acquisition, where the diffusion data in the OASIS database were acquired with a singleshell acquisition. Two well-known confounding factors for DTI analysis are PVEs and crossing fiber differentiation. The limitation associated with PVEs was minimized using an algorithm to remove the FW components from DTI data. However, the FW correction algorithm is ill-posed for single-shell DTI acquisitions 99, thus requiring regularization, and this method does not address limitations related to crossing fibers, as FW-FA may be underestimated in regions with crossing fibers 100. To completely overcome these two limitations, different diffusion MRI acquisitions (such as multi-shell) and analysis methods must be employed.\nIn conclusion, this study supports the existence of substantial volumetric and microstructural changes between healthy aging and AD, with similar spatiotemporal trends observed between males and females in regions critical to the development and symptomatology of AD. We further examined sex differences in AD beyond that seen in healthy brain aging in both white and grey matter, demonstrating subtle volumetric and microstructural changes in females and males. Notably, higher cerebellar GM volume and lower WM microstructural disorganization in females with AD were observed and warrant further investigation. Lastly, these findings suggest that sex-specific radiological AD phenotypes should be considered in the development and assessment of neuroimaging biomarkers in AD cohorts. Effect-size from post-hoc comparison between AD and HC in females (a) and males (b). Similar trends were found for each group. All significant clusters in figure are shown at higher effect-size level. Similar trends were observed for both males and females, where the AD cohort showed lower GM volumes, higher FW index, lower FW-FA, and higher FW-RD than the HC group. Effect-size from post-hoc comparison between females and males within the AD (a) and HC (b) groups. In the AD group, males showed lower GM volumes, higher FW index, higher FW-FA, lower FW-RD than females at large effect-size. Differences between AD males and AD females were also observed using FW-AxD. In the HC group, only VBM detected differences between females and males at the large effect-size level.",

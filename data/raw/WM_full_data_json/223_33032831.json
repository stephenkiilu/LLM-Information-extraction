    "abstract": "Introduction: Cerebral microinfarcts (CMI) are common lesions, carrying an important contribution to smallvessel-related cognitive impairment. CMIs were previously found to cause local microstructural damage and disruption of white matter integrity. This study examines CMIs influence on cortical thickness in remote brain areas. Methods: Six small silent diffuse weighted imaging (DWI) lesions corresponding to subacute CMI were identified among five patients who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI scans from the Tel-Aviv Acute Brain Stroke Cohort (TABASCO). Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the site of the DWI lesions and of the nonlesioned contralateral hemisphere (control ROI) were co-registered. DTI tractography was additionally performed to reconstruct the white matter tracts containing the ROIs. The normalized cortical thickness was calculated for the DWI lesional tract as well as for the contralateral non-lesional tract, and the lesion-to-control cortical thickness ratio (CTR) was calculated. Results: Post-lesional scans, performed 25.1  1.2 months after CMI detection, demonstrated reduced mean CTR within the ROI from 1.8 to 1.1 (p  0.032). There was no difference between the CTR of the right hemisphere relative to those on the left hemisphere, or between the CTR change of the cortical and non-cortical CMI. Discussion: This study demonstrated the prolonged influence of CMI on cortical thickness in remote ROI. The total number of CMIs is difficult to determine, however it has been shown that detecting even a single CMI suggests the existence of hundreds to thousands lesions. Therefore, the cumulative impact of these widely distributed lesions on cerebral cortex may have a significant contribution to the development of vascular cognitive impairment.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral microinfarcts (CMI) are the most widespread type of brain infarction 1. These asymptomatic lesions can be demonstrated by MRI as small hyperintense lesions on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) only during the acute phase (10 days), thereby making it difficult to determine the total number of CMIs 1,2. Previous studies have shown that detecting even a single CMI suggests the presence of hundreds to thousands CMIs 1,3, pointing out their potential important contribution to small-vessel-related cognitive impairment 456.\nThese lesions may cause both local and remote brain structural changes 4,7. CMIs were previously found to cause local microstructural damage and disruption of white matter integrity 4, but the effect on grey matter has not yet been established. This prospective study examined CMIs long standing influence on cortical thickness in remote areas.",

      "text": "Five Participants recruited for the Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort study (TABASCO) 8, were included in the present study. The TABASCO study included men and women aged over 50, admitted to the Tel-Aviv Medical Center from April 2008 to January 2015, due to first ever TIA or mild to moderate acute ischemic stroke (NIH stroke scale 9 (NIHSS)  17). Out of this cohort, 66 participants had both baseline and follow-up MRI scans. These patients had similar baseline https:doi.org10.1016j.jns.2020.117170 Received 12 May 2020; Received in revised form 13 August 2020; Accepted 1 October 2020 characteristics compared to the rest of the TABASCO cohort, including age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) on admission. 5 patients were found to have CMI in baseline scan, therefore included in the present study. All scans included fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) 8. The TABASCO study was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01926691. All participants signed informed consent forms, approved by the local ethics committee.",

    "MRI acquisition and analysis": {
      "text": "All participants underwent brain MRI using a 3 T GE scanner (GE Signa EXCITE, Milwaukee, WI, USA), within 7 days of the admitting event. DWI sequences of all patients were assessed by a vascular neurologist (E.A.  J.M.) for the presence of CMI. All images were independently rated by both raters, with Kappa of 1.0. All lesions defined as CMI had no corresponding signal in gradient-echo (GRE) or susceptible-weighted-imaging (SWI) sequences, and were not in the same vascular territory as the symptomatic infarct.\nAs mentioned before, each subject underwent MRI scans including fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) and diffusion imaging, including DWI and DTI. DWI lesional scan was registered with the DTI scan by using the automatic non-linear background registration of the DSI studio auto-registration tools. Diffusion tractography by the DTI method using the eigenanalysis 9 on the calculated tensors was done. The lesions detected on the DWI scans were signed as ROIs and the relevant fiber bundles were identified by using a white matter atlas and were constructed by delineation of the required bundles from the whole brain tractography construction using the ROI based approach. The control ROI was created on the contralateral hemisphere. The cortical thickness of the whole brain was calculated by Freesurfer v.06 automatic tools 10 based on the FSPGR scans. The volume was co-registered with the DTI scans using the FSL registration tool 11,12, and the whole brain thickness was exported as a mask file.\nThe cortical thickness was normalized by dividing the voxel of the ROI by the whole ROI size. By doing this, the ROI size effect was reduced.\nThe normalized cortical thickness was calculated for the DWI lesion hemisphere as well as the contralateral hemisphere. This process was repeated for the follow-up scanning. The coregistration of the lesion scan with the follow-up scan was made using non-linear registration and a manual verification of anatomical structures and the whitematter atlas.\nThe prespecified primary hypothesis was that incident DWI lesions would result in focally reeduced CTR (cortical thickness ratio) within the lesion ROIs on post-lesional scans relative to lesion scans.",

      "text": "Five subjects (Table 1; mean age 71.6  11 years) had a total of 6 DWI lesions; 4 of the 5 had a single DWI lesion, while one (subject A) had 2 lesions on one scan. (See Fig. 1.) The mean time interval between the lesion detecting DWI and the postlesional scans were 25.1  1.2 months. The mean cortical thickness lesioncontrol ratio within the ROI decreased on the postlesional scans from 1.8 to 1.1 (t  2.36, p  0.032) and the median CTR decreased from 2.12 to 1.17 (Z  -1.76, p  0.039) in the follow-up scan. Moreover, there was no difference between the CTR of the right hemisphere (from both scans) relative to those on the left hemisphere (t  -0.431,p  NS). Additionally, there was no difference between the CTR change of the cortical lesions (2 lesions) relative to the non-cortical lesions (4 lesions) (t  -0.15, p  NS).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study we demonstrated that small asymptomatic DWI lesions have prolonged influence on cortical thickness in remote ROI after a mean follow-up interval of 2 years. This finding shows that each CMI cause not only local structural damage, but also persistent remote tissue damage in the cortical grey matter. As the presence of one CMI may reflect the ongoing appearance of numerous lesions 2, the cumulative impact of these widely distributed lesions on cerebral cortex may have an important contribution to the development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and cortical atrophy.\nVascular dementia is the endpoint of recurrent clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemic events, causing additive local structural damage 4,13,14. Our findings are in line with previous studies which demonstrated remote cortical thinning secondary to acute symptomatic infarcts 15,16. These results imply that the burden of recurrent events is exceeds the sum of local damage, as any event causes also remote down the stream cortical alternations. The current finding of remote cortical influence even after the occurrence of very small asymptomatic infarcts is novel and may be significant for understanding the pathophysiology underlying vascular dementia. Prior studies examined symptomatic infarcts (mean NIHSS 2 and 10) 15,16, and much larger lesions 15 -median size of 356 mm 3 compare to CMI size of less than 1 mm 3 .\nCerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in considered to be one of the main causes for cognitive impairment 17,18. As small vessels are not visualized in conventional imaging, SVD burden is assessed by indirect MRI markers, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces and more 19. These markers are neither specific to SVD, nor represent its full burden 20. Previous studies looking at SVD markers association with vascular cognitive impairment showed conflicting results 17,20,21. An attempt to use global SVD score did not show confident results 17,22. Most of these studies however, did not look at CMIs. As CMIs disappear within 10 days and leave no trace on conventional imaging 1, examination of their contribution to VCI in a prospective trial is difficult, resulting in CMIs to be overlooked until the past decade. Furthermore, even when these lesions are demonstrated, their small size made it hard to grasp their cumulative influence on local and remote brain areas.\nThe results of previous studies 2,4 and the current study point out that these invisible lesions may be the missing link in understanding the interrelation between SVD and vascular cognitive impairment. CMI may be a sensitive marker for ongoing SVD and for risk stratification of vascular dementia. The prevalence of CMI is specific populations also supports them as a possible biomarker. CMI prevalence was found to be 0 in healthy patients 23, 0.9-5.2 in patients with cognitive symptoms 24,25, and 15 in patients with SVD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 26. CMI rate in our cohort was 7.6, which is consistent with these results. Another CMI advantage is the high interrater reliability showed in our study. Future studies using novel techniques may allow evaluating CMI effect on larger cohorts and fully evaluate CMI clinical-radiological-pathological correlation. As high resolution 7 T MRI can demonstrate chronic CMI lesions 27,28, it may have a key role in these future studies.\nThe strengths of this study include its prospective design and the identical protocol of repeated imaging. The latter allows the co-registration methods for localizing lesion and control ROIs on postlesional scan, and the comparison not only to the postlesional scan but also to the homologous ROI in the contralateral hemisphere. The main limitation of our study is the small sample size. Although our results were statistically significant, the small number of subjects did not allow us to evaluate the individual impact of cortical versus sub-cortical CMIs, as well as their differences. Second, CMI impact interpretation is limited by the absence of neuro-pathologic correlation.\nIn conclusion, CMI is an important, still under looked, SVD marker. Although asymptomatic the acute phase, our findings may imply CMIs significant long-term symptomatic effect.",

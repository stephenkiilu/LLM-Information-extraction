    "abstract": "Recent studies in subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) suggest the involvement of white matter (WM) abnormalities underlying the pathogenesis of cognitive function impairment. Here, we performed magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on detecting WM damage and to investigate the correlations between DTI measures and cognitive dysfunction in SIVD patients. Fifty right-handed SIVD patients were recruited and divided into vascular cognitive impairment on dementia (VCIND) group and normal cognition (NC) group. Twenty-two VCIND patients and 28 NC patients underwent DTI scanning and neuropsychological assessment. Atlas-based analysis (ABA) was performed on each subject for extracting FA and MD measures from supratentorial tracts. Among VCIND, as compared to NC patients, decreased FA and increased MD were observed in all projection fibers (bilateral anterior, posterior limb, and retrolenticular part of internal capsule, anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata and posterior thalamic radiation), association fibers (bilateral sagittal stratum, external capsule, cingulum, fornix, and stria terminalis, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus), and commissural fibers (genu, body, splenium, and bilateral tapetum of corpus callosum). Furthermore, we also found that MoCA scores correlated with DTI values in all supratentorial WM tracts. The results suggested that SIVD patients demonstrated abnormal WM connectivity in all supratentorial regions. Moreover, the severity of damage in WM tracts correlated with cognitive dysfunction.",

      "text": "Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD is characterized by white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and lacunes in regions of subcortical whiter matter and basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is a more homogeneous subtype of cerebral vascular disease and considered as one of the major causes for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) (Erkinjuntti et al. 2000;Roman et al. 2002). VCI has been classified into three subtypes: vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed Alzheimers disease (AD) with VaD (Moorhouse and Rockwood 2008). VCIND has been proposed as a prodromal stage of VaD (Frisoni et al. 2002;Galluzzi et al. 2005;Seo et al. 2010), which suggested potentially reversible through recent reports (Jak et al. 2009;Ravaglia et al. 2006). So, early detection of VCI is critical for the timely treatment and improvement of prognosis.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a more recent MRI-based technique, is a noninvasive method for delineating specific white matter (WM) structures in vivo. DTI detects microstructural alterations in white matter tracts by measuring the directionality of molecular diffusion (fractional anisotropy, FA) and the average motion of water molecules (mean diffusivity, MD) (Xu et al. 2010). Although the white matter damage is crucial in patients with SIVD, few research have been reported for investigating the relationship between the cognitive function and abnormalities of DTI parameters (OSullivan et al. 2001(OSullivan et al. , 2004)). Moreover, most DTI studies have used manual tracing of region of interest (ROI) and thus included only limited regions rather than assessing whole brain areas (OSullivan et al. 2004). To examine the integrity of the entire WM regions, voxel-based group analysis (VBA) is an effective initial method used in SIVD (Della Nave et al. 2007;Kim et al. 2011). However, the VBA often suffers from low statistical power because of high noise and partial volume effects.\nIn our current study, we utilized a novel DTI analysis method-atlas-based whole brain white matter analysis (ABA) (Oishi et al. 2009), to assess the microstructure (including FA and MD measures) of a large number of white matter tracts in 50 SIVD patients with or without cognitive impairment. Because the supratentorial white matter is a common location for WMH and lacunars in SIVD patients (Munoz et al. 1993), we hypothesized that FA would decrease and MD would increase in the supratentorial WM, including projection (e.g., internal capsule and corona radiata), association (e.g., superior longitudinal, superior, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi), and commissural (e.g., corpus callosum) fibers. Moreover, as the white matter integrity is the fundament of global cognitive function, we also speculated that the reduced FA and increased MD values of the WM would be associated with the poor neuropsychological scores .",

      "text": "From January 2012 to March 2013, 50 right-handed SIVD patients were consecutively enrolled from the Department of Neurology. All patients had experienced a clinical lacunar stroke at least 3 months prior to recruitment. We used the SIVD imaging criteria suggested by Galluzzi et al. (2005), which require at least moderate white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI plus lacunar infarct(s) in the periventricular and deep WM structures. These criteria are based on a modification of those for subcortical VaD described by Erkinjuntti et al. (2000), which aims to include milder cases.\nThe diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment on dementia (VCIND) was performed by two experienced neurologists in consensus according to criteria (Erkinjuntti et al. 2000;Moorhouse and Rockwood 2008;Petersen 2004;Roman et al. 2002) that included the following: (1) subjective cognitive complaints reported by the participant or hisher caregiver; (2) objective cognitive impairments, but not meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for dementia; (3) normal or nearnormal performance of general cognitive functioning and no or minimum impairments of daily life activities; (4) Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score0.5; (5) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 24. The exclusive criteria for included VCIND (Roman et al. 2002;Zhou and Jia 2009):\n(1) memory deficit and other cognitive impairment in the absence of focal lesions on imaging; (2) cognitive impairments caused by nonvascular reasons, such as tumor, trauma, psychiatric disease, systemic disease; (3) signs of large vessel disease, such as cortical andor corticosubcortical nonlacunar territorial infarcts and watershed infarcts or hemorrhages; (4) leukoencephalopathy as a result of other causes, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, brain irradiation, and metabolic diseases. In addition, other SIVD patients were included as the normal cognition (NC) group if they had no cognitive complaints, impairments of daily life activities, and abnormalities in above neuropsychological scales.\nAs a result, 50 SIVD patients recruited were subdivided into NC group (n28) and VCIND group (n22). The hospital research ethics committee approved the study protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All participants underwent a standardized clinical evaluation, which included a general neurological examination, a global cognitive level test (i.e., CDR, MMSE, MoCA) and MR scan (i.e., T1, T2, T2FLAIR, DWI, DTI).",

      "text": "Patients were performed on a 3 T MR scanner (GE discovery 750) equipped with an eight channel high-resolution head coil. The diffusion-weighted imaging acquired as the following parameters: single-shot EPI, spin echo sequence, 40 diffusion weighting directions, matrix size128128, repetition time8325 ms, echo time87.6 ms, field of view256 256 mm 2 , slice thickness4 mm, slice number35 slices. The first volumes were b0 volumes, and the b value of other volumes was 1000 smm2. After acquisitions, the data were downloaded from the scanner, transferred, and processed using a pipeline tool, PANDA (Cui et al. 2013) (http:www. nitrc.orgprojectspanda). The main procedure of PANA included preprocessing and producing diffusion metrics. First, The preprocess steps (including Converting Dicom files into Nifti images, Estimating the brain mask, Cropping the raw images, Correcting for the eddy-current effect, Calculating diffusion tensor metrics) were executed one by one. Then, we used the tool to normalize diffusion metrics (FA, MD) into the MNI space and calculated regional diffusion metrics by averaging the values within each region of the ICBM DTI-81 atlas (Mori et al. 2008). For further analyses, we focused on FA and MD values of all available projection, association, and commissural tract ROIs as hypothesized previously (Tables 1 and2, Fig. 1).",

Demographic variables and cognitive performances were compared between the NC and VCIND group with independent sample t test for continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data, and χ2 test for sex proportion. As the distribution was not normal in diffusion values of several tracts, we conducted the nonparametric analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) to compare FA and MD values between groups. The mean and standard deviation, or the median and the interquartile range, were used to describe continuous variables. In addition, for tracts that showed significant differences between groups, Spearman correlations were performed between the DTI metrics and MoCA scores. The significant threshold was set at P0.05.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study was set out to detect the regional WM microstructure change in SIVD patients and examine the relationship between the WM damage and the cognitive function impairment using the atlas-based diffusion tensor analysis. Our study showed microstructure alteration in all supratentorial WM regions, including projection, association, and commissural fibers. In addition, the severity of damage in WM tracts correlated with the cognitive dysfunction in SIVD patients. There were controversial reports about regions of WM changes in SIVD patients. One the one hand, researchers found reduced FA and increased MD values only in limited regions. For example, some found decreased FA in anterior CC, frontal, and parietal white matter in VaD (Zarei et al. 2009). Some reported FA decreased and ADC increased in the regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and centrum semiovale areas in VCI patients (Zhang et al. 2011). However, on the other hand, some authors reported that VCIND patients had a more widespread WM change; they found that FA values reduced and MD values increased in all supratentorial WM, including frontal lobes, parietal lobes, temporal lobes, occipital lobes, and corpus callosum (Shim et al. 2008;Zhou et al. 2011). Our findings showed that widely distributed set of supratentorial tracts (projection, association, and commissural fibers) had abnormalities in SIVD patients, which are consistent with the latter findings. In reality, the discrepancy between this research and our own may be due to differences in the study group selection and adopted diagnosis criteria. As the purpose of our research is to detect vascular cognitive impairment in the early stage, we collected mild severe SIVD patients. More importantly, more tracts discrepancies found in our study can be attributable to the use of the novel data analysis method-ABA. As previously mentioned, most prior studies used manual ROI or VBA analysis. However, ROI measurements may not be comprehensive enough to study white matter changes over diffuse areas in SIVD patients. Similarly, VBA has some concerning limitations, as it need to utilize spatial blurring which can potentially obscure differences; worse still, it introduces noise within adjacent WM tracts. The ABA ameliorates above problems by combining the voxel-based method with a presegmented brain atlas. Within accurate normalization, the whole brain could be automatically segmented into many structural components (Oishi et al. 2009). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using the ABA in analyzing WM microstructual changes in SIVD patients. This method enables us to further distinguish and calculate metrics of specific WM fibers in SIVD patients.\nSeveral research reported cognitive impairment correlated with WM microstructure changes reflected by DTI metrics in SIVD patients (Kim et al. 2011;Xu et al. 2010;Zhou et al. 2008Zhou et al. , 2011)). Our current findings are consistent with studies reported previously, and further suggest that damages in projection, association, and commissural fibers both contribute to cognitive impairment in SIVD patients. As everyone knows, projection fibers play vital roles in the subcortical thalamicbasal-prefrontal circuits. A noteworthy hypothesis to explain cognitive impairment in SIVD patients is that nerve tract damage results in a disconnection syndrome,due to the disruption of large tracts of white matter fibers. Our results, in line with previous hypotheses, find damages in projection fibers; this provides an additional evidence that damages to projection fibers may be an important mechanism of cognitive impairment in SIVD patients. In addition, as tracts connecting cortical to cortical, association fibers are the fundament of cognitive function integrity. Although there were several studies which reported cognitive function correlated with association fibers in diseases like MCIAD, PD, and DB (Meng et al. 2012;Reijmer et al. 2013;Zheng et al. 2014), seldom can we found research focusing on relation between VCI and the WM integrity of association fibers. Our studies have filled this blank by proving that cognitive function correlated with widespread association fiber integrity. Moreover, we find that the diffusion tensor value in each region of corpus callosum has a strong correlation with the general cognitive impairment. These finding are consistent with a former research finding that reduced DA values of corpus callosum correlated with the global cognitive impairment (Otsuka et al. 2012), and further suggest that callosal subregional parameters may be sensitive markers of cognitive impairment in SIVD patients for monitoring disease progression and evaluating treatment efficacy. The current study also analyzes the relationship between WM integrity and global cognitive function evaluated by the (Hachinski et al. 2006). Although the MoCA is not clinically detailed neuropsychological evaluations, but are rather ideal for patient screening and quantifying change over time. We used this scale because they are not only widely used in everyday clinical practice, but also suitable for clinical trials in which sensitivity and ease of administration are equally important.\nOur study has some limitations. First, although the ABA method is highly valuable for assessing FA and MD values in regions of white matter tracts, its accuracy could be affected in the presence of certain brain abnormalities. For example, the brain maps might not be warped sufficiently to match the temple because enlarged ventricles. Thus, ROCs of periventricular fibers sometimes mixed a portion of CSF. This error could cause relatively noisy measurements and reduce inspection efficiency. In order to avoid possible noise in using ABA, we carefully excluded patients with obvious encephalatrophy. Second, we evacuated relations between DTI metrics and cognitive function without adopting cortical volumes as a covariant, which is also an important factor in dementia. However, former researcher declared that reduction of cortical volume in VaD is likely to be secondary to substantial white matter damage through wallerian degeneration, and VaD is a predominantly a subcortical but not cortical dementia rather than AD (Graham et al. 2004). Therefore, cortical volume may not be essential in correlation analysis in SIVD.\nFinally, because our study is based on a single hospital and have relatively small sample size, our results might be affected by bias. A study combining population-based multicenter and large sample size should be promoted in the future.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that SIVD patients display abnormal WM connectivity in all supratentorial regions, involving projection, association, and commissural fibers. Moreover, the severity of damage in WM tracts is correlated with cognitive dysfunction in SIVD patients. The DTI atlas analysis may provide insight into the etiology of cognitive impairments in SIVD, as well as provide guidance for future studies to identify early imaging biomarker of cognitive impairment.",

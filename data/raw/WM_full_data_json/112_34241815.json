    "abstract": "There is wide variation in the reported prevalence of cognitive impairment in people with HIV (PWH). Part of this variation may be attributable to different studies using different methods of combining neuropsychological test scores to classify participants as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired. Our aim was to determine, in a South African cohort of PWH (N  148), (a) how much variation in reported rates was due to method used to define cognitive impairment and (b) which method correlated best with MRI biomarkers of HIV-related brain pathology. Participants completed detailed neuropsychological assessment and underwent 3 T structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We used the neuropsychological data to investigate 20 different methods of determining HIV-associated cognitive impairment. We used the neuroimaging data to obtain volumes for cortical and subcortical grey matter and total white matter and DTI metrics for several white matter tracts. Applying each of the 20 methods to the cognitive dataset resulted in a wide variation (20-97) in estimated rates of impairment. Logistic regression models showed no method was associated with HIV-related neuroimaging abnormalities as measured by structural volumes or DTI metrics. We conclude that for the population from which this sample was drawn, much of the variation in reported rates of cognitive impairment in PWH is due to the method of classification used, and that none of these methods accurately reflects biological effects of HIV in the brain. We suggest that defining HIV-associated cognitive impairment using neuropsychological test performance only is insufficient; pre-morbid functioning, co-morbidities, cognitive symptoms, and functional impairment should always be considered.

      "text": "There is, however, wide variation in reported rates of cognitive impairment in people with HIV (PWH), with published estimates ranging from 22 to 80 (Joska et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2020;Yakasai et al. 2015;Yusuf et al. 2017). Some of this variation may be explained by between-sample differences in HIV disease characteristics, neurological and psychiatric comorbidities, and socioeconomic attributes. Additional variation may emerge from inconsistent norming practices and erratic availability of well-matched normative data in different populations and regions (Gates and Cysique 2016;Winston and Spudich 2020). Of interest here, however, is the variation due to differences between the actual criteria used to define cognitive impairment in PWH.\nWithin the HIV literature, several different sets of criteria have been used to determine whether cognitive performance indicates impairment. Differences between these sets of criteria result from different approaches to combining neuropsychological test scores to classify participants as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired. There is no consensus on which set of criteria is the gold standard, and there are often no specific guidelines on how criteria are to be applied. Hence, it is unsurprising that there are between-study differences in approaches and, consequently, variable rates of reported cognitive impairment in PWH. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated empirically that the application of different criteria to define cognitive impairment results in different estimated rates of such impairment within the same group of participants (De Francesco et al. 2016;Tierney et al. 2017;Wang et al. 2019).\nThe most commonly used set of criteria used to define cognitive impairment in PWH are the updated American Academy of Neurology criteria (also known as the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) or Frascati criteria; Antinori et al. 2007) and the global deficit score (GDS) criteria (Carey et al. 2004). Under the Frascati criteria, one cut-off for cognitive impairment is established as being when neuropsychological test performance in at least two cognitive domains is 1 SD below the normative mean (indicating a diagnosis of asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ANI or mild neurocognitive disorder MND). Another, more stringent, cut-off is defined when neuropsychological test performance in at least two cognitive domains is 2 SD below the normative mean (indicating a diagnosis of HIV-associated dementia HAD). Some studies suggest that the Frascati criteria risk overestimating the rate of cognitive impairment in both PWH and healthy controls (Meyer et al. 2013;Nightingale et al. 2014;Underwood et al. 2018). For instance, Gisslén et al. (2011) demonstrated that because cognitive test performance ought to be normally distributed, 16 of the general population should score more than 1 SD below the normative mean on any given neuropsychological test. Moreover, they noted that this probability can change depending on how many cognitive domains are assessed by a test battery, how many tests are contained within each domain, and the magnitude of correlations between individual test scores and overall domain scores. Depending on the values of those variables, 20 or more of healthy controls can meet Frascati criteria for cognitive impairment. Similarly, Underwood et al. (2018) used simulated normative data informed by the Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty (POPPY) dataset (a multi-centre, prospective cohort from the UK and Republic of Ireland;De Francesco et al. 2016) to show that using the Frascati and GDS approaches resulted in 26 and 21 of their HIV-uninfected population meeting criteria for cognitive impairment.\nRecently developed classification methods such as the Multivariate Normative Comparison (MNC; Huizenga et al. 2016Huizenga et al. , 2007) ) and the Novel Multivariate Method (NMM; Underwood et al. 2019) attempt to reduce the number of false positives in estimates of cognitive impairment in PWH. The developers of these methods suggest that their approaches reduce the problem of Type I errors by accounting for inherent correlation between test scores and cognitive domain scores. They also argue that their methods are appropriate for dichotomizing cognitive outcomes (impairedunimpaired). Those two sets of criteria, as well as the GDS criteria, rely solely on the interpretation of neuropsychological test performance to define cognitive impairment. They are not informed by, for instance, subjective reports regarding cognitive symptoms, measures of functional impairment in daily living, or pre-morbid functioning. The classification of cognitive impairment using other methods, such as the Frascati criteria, incorporate data on daily functioning into the categories of classification (i.e., a classification of MND or HAD requires functional impairment in daily living alongside measured cognitive impairment).\nAnother source of variation in estimated rates of cognitive impairment in PWH is that many of the classification criteria can be applied to cognitive test scores in different ways; there are no specific guidelines and no consensus agreement stating how they should be applied. For example, the application of some criteria first requires the researcher to define withindomain impairment (e.g., as noted above, the Frascati criteria defines impaired performance as 1 SD below the normative mean within at least two different cognitive domains), but there is no standard, agreed-upon definition of that term. Hence, where some might define it as being poor performance on one test within a domain, others might define it as being poor performance on multiple tests within that domain, or poor performance on all tests within that domain, or a poor average of all test scores within a domain. Although some of these definitions are used more frequently than others, all are viable options and all have been used in the literature. Meyer et al. (2013) used the Frascati criteria to show that, depending on the definition of within-domain impairment (and correlations between test scores and domain scores), false-positive rates of cognitive impairment ranged from 2 to 74 in their sample (normative data simulated from a Kenyan HIV-negative sample without neurologic comorbidities, depression, substance abuse, or learning disorders).\nGiven that the use of different criteria, and different application of components of those criteria, gives rise to different rates of cognitive impairment in PWH (and to different rates of false positives), some criteria and their applications may be better at identifying actual HIV-related brain pathology than others. However, no published study has investigated how different classification criteria and variations in their application relate to HIV-associated brain pathology. Such pathology is often measured by the proxies of regional brain volumes and diffusion metrics on MRI. Compared to HIVnegative controls, PWH have significantly lower volumes of total white matter, subcortical grey matter, and cortical grey matter (Heaps et al. 2012;Ortega et al. 2013;Paul et al. 2017), as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) abnormalities across multiple tracts (Leite et al. 2013;Paul et al. 2017;Underwood et al. 2017). Moreover, regional brain volumes have also been shown to correlate with cognitive impairment as defined independently by the Frascati, GDS, or MNC criteria (Campbell et al. 2020;Underwood et al. 2019).",

    "The Current Study": {
      "text": "There is no consensus in the literature on which set of criteria used to define cognitive impairment in PWH is the gold standard, and there are no guidelines about whether any of the classification methods should vary by setting. For instance, it is unclear whether some methods are better suited for use in high-income versus low-income countries. In South Africa, a low-and middle-income country (LMIC) that has the highest number of HIV infections in the world (7.7 million PWH), the issue of prevalence of cognitive impairment is highly relevant to the allocation of resources and the setting of research agendas. Hence, the first aim of this study was to investigate how much variation in the rates of cognitive impairment in PWH is due to variation in classification methods used to indicate impairment. To achieve this aim, we scoured the HIV literature to identify all sets of classification criteria (and all of their viable methods of application) used to combine scores from a battery of neuropsychological tests in order to classify cognitive impairment. We then classified PWH from a South African cohort as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired using the different existing classification methods and calculated all of the resulting rates of cognitive impairment. Because we wanted to determine the effectiveness of an approach to diagnosing impairment that utilizes cognitive test scores alone, we did not include data on functional impairment.\nThe second aim of this study was to determine which method of classifying cognitive impairment correlated best with regional brain volumes and DTI metrics (i.e., proxies for HIV-associated brain pathology). Studies in high-income countries have shown that some classification methods are associated with neuroimaging abnormities. Currently, there is no research guiding choice of criteria in LMICs such as South Africa and so findings related to this second aim will guide local researchers and clinicians on which classification method to use.",

      "text": "Participants (N  148) were recruited from primary care clinics in Khayelitsha (a peri-urban township in Cape Town, South Africa) as part of a study exploring viral clade effects on brain signatures of HIV (Paul et al. 2014). Khayelitsha was established by the apartheid regime in 1985 to relocate poor Black people. As a consequence of this legacy, today, almost all of its residents are Black, the predominant language spoken is Xhosa, and fewer than one-third of adults have completed high school. There are high levels of HIV infection, poverty, and unemployment (Smit et al. 2016;City of Cape Town 2013).\nOur studys inclusion criteria required that participants (1) be HIV seropositive, (2) have Xhosa as their home language, (3) be aged 18-50 years at the time of recruitment (we specified this age range so as to avoid central nervous system CNS complications associated with neurodevelopment and advanced age), (4) have at least 5 years of formal education, and (5) have initiated cART within 3 months of enrollment into the original study. Exclusion criteria were (1) any self-reported major DSM Axis I psychiatric condition that could significantly affect cognitive functioning (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), (2) neurological disease that could affect brain integrity, (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage A, (4) opportunistic CNS infection, (5) lifetime history of head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for  30 min, and (6) current substance use disorder as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus (MINI Plus; Sheehan et al. 1998).

    "Measures and procedure": {
      "text": "Cognitive testing Participants were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. The battery comprised 17 standardized tests, each of which assessed performance in one of six cognitive domains commonly affected by HIV (Grant 2008) Normative standards for these neuropsychological tests were based on control data from the UCT HIV Mental Health Research Unit (Westgarth-Taylor  Joska, personal communication, November 2017). These data were collected between 2008 and 2011 from 119 healthy community-dwelling individuals who presented at the same Khayelitsha clinics from which the current sample was recruited. Hence, the control sample and the current sample of HIV seropositive participants were similar across key demographic (age, ethnicity, language, education), psychosocial, and socioeconomic characteristics. Inclusionexclusion criteria were also similar; the sole exception was that all controls were required to have laboratoryconfirmed seronegative status.\nControl data allowed calculation of demographically corrected T-scores, the type of standard score used most frequently by HIV neuropsychologists. To complete this calculation, we used standard regression-based norming processes. First, linear regressions were applied to the raw scores for each test outcome variable with age, years of education, and sex as predictors. Predictors were removed from the regression model if they were not significantly associated with the test score. Then, coefficients were used to calculate a predicted score based on the age, education, andor sex of the participant for each test outcome variable. Each participants predicted score was subtracted from their raw score to calculate the residual. The residual was divided by the standard error of the residuals to calculate the z-score (M  0, SD  1). Z-scores were reversed if a higher score on the test indicated poorer performance (e.g., as was the case with all test for which completion time was the outcome variable). The z-scores were then converted to demographically corrected T-scores (M  50, SD  10). This process removes the effects of age, years of education, and sex, and so demographically corrected T-scores allow for fair interpretation of HIV-related disease effects across sociodemographic boundaries (Gates and Cysique 2016).",

    "Methods of defining cognitive impairment": {
      "text": "A search of the HIV literature identified eight different sets of criteria used to define cognitive impairment in PWH. We limited the search to criteria in use since 2007, when the Frascati criteria were proposed, and we excluded methods requiring subjective application of clinical judgment, such as those described by Woods et al. (2004) and by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\nThe eight sets of criteria can be applied to demographically adjusted T-scores in different ways, resulting in 20 separate methods that can be used to define cognitive impairment in PWH (see Table 1). Although it is not clear whether all 20 methods have been used empirically in the published literature (studies do not always provide sufficient details of their methods and statistical procedures), all are viable ways in which to apply the criteria.\nWe classified each participant in our sample as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired using the cut-offs proposed by each method.\nNeuroimaging acquisition Images were acquired on a Siemens Allegra 3 T scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen Germany), with a 4-channel phased array head coil. We acquired a T1-weighted 3-D MPRAGE sequence (TR  2400 ms, TE  2.38 ms, TI  1000 ms, flip angle  8, slices  162, voxel size  1  1  1 mm 3 ) for volumetric analyses. For a detailed description of these methods, see Paul et al. (2017).\nVolumetric analysis Freesurfer software suite (v5.1) (Martinos Center, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA; http: surfer. nmr. mgh. harvard.edu) was used for volumetric quantification. Briefly, MPRAGE scans were transformed into a template space with the skull stripped and the brain segmented into white matter, grey matter, and ventricles. Brain regions were parcellated into subcortical and cortical regions of interest using a surface deformation program (Desikan et al. 2006;Fischl and Dale 2000;Fischl et al. 2002). Images from all subjects were aligned to the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al. 2006). Variables included in the present study included total white matter volume, total cortical grey matter volume, and subcortical grey matter volume (composite variable of the volumes of the caudate, putamen, thalamus, globus pallidus, and hippocampus). Volumes were measured bilaterally and aggregated across hemispheres.\nNormative data for the neuroimaging measures were collected from 34 HIV-negative community-dwelling individuals. They were recruited from local voluntary counseling and testing clinics in Khayelitsha. This control group was well-matched to the current patient group on key demographic variables (e.g., language, socioeconomic status). Despite the relatively small size of the control group, their data were normally distributed; this indicates that it was representative of a normal population and that we could therefore capture a normative brain signature.\nThe control data were used to standardize the raw imaging scores to z-scores. We standardized the imaging data in this way so as to capture the effects of the HIV disease process on the brain and to be consistent with how the neuropsychological data were processed.\nDiffusion metrics Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were preprocessed using FSL 5.0 (Jenkinson et al. 2012) as follows. They were corrected for motion and eddy-current induced artifacts through affine registration to the first baseline volume using FSL FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith 2001) with the mutual information criteria. The orientations of the gradient encoding directions were corrected by the rotation induced by these registrations (Leemans and Jones 2009), and the brain tissue was extracted using FSL brain extraction tool (BET; Smith 2002) with a fraction threshold of 0.45. DTIs were estimated for each subject using FSL DTIFIT. Then, a study-specific white matter atlas was created using DTI-TK (Zhang et al. 2007). The template DTI was computed by iteratively deforming and averaging the population imaging data using the tensor-based deformable registration algorithm in DTI-TK (Zhang et al. 2006) with finite strain tensor reorientation and the deviatoric tensor similarity metric. This template was used to define inclusion and exclusion region of interest (ROI) masks for the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulum bundle (CING), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and corpus callosum (CC) (Mori and Van Zijl 2002). Whole brain tractography was performed in the template image, and subsets of curves were interactively selected to represent each tract-of-interest (TOI). For each bundle, two inclusion ROI masks and one exclusion ROI mask were drawn in template space using ITK-SNAP (Yushkevich et al. 2006). These masks were placed at opposite ends of each tractography bundle template and drawn in reference to standard white matter atlases (Catani and de Schotten 2012;Oishi et al. 2010).\nSubject-specific fiber bundle metrics were computed as follows. First, the TOI inclusion and exclusion masks were deformed to subject native space using the DTI-TK registration. Whole brain tractography was then performed in subject native space and a subset of curves in the TOI was selected using the two inclusion and exclusion masks. Tractography was performed using deterministic streamline integration (Zhang et al. 2003) with a step size of 1 mm, tricubic interpolation, and four jittered seeds per voxel. Termination criteria included an angle threshold of 45 degrees and minimum fractional anisotropy (FA) of 0.15 mm2msec. Fiber curves with a length less than 10 mm were excluded from the analysis. The following bundle average metrics (averaged across hemispheres) were computed from the resulting curves and retained for statistical analyses: radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), and FA (Correia et al. 2008). 2019) NA  Our literature search did not locate any studies that used this method. We also found a method that is similar to Gisslen 2 (Meyer et al. 2013). However, the Meyer method requires that only three to five discrete cognitive domains are included in analysis. Because our test battery assesses performance across six cognitive domains, we did not evaluate the performance of this method.",

Application of the different methods (expect for MNC and NMM) to define cognitive impairment was accomplished in Microsoft Excel. Application of the MNC method was accomplished by running the R-script provided by the authors (Agelink van Rentergem, personal communication, August 2017). Application of the NMM method was accomplished using the web-based interface developed by the authors (https: jonat hanunder wood. shiny apps. io cogni tive_ calcu lator).\nRegarding volumetric data, 20 separate logistic regression models were conducted for each cognitive impairment classification method. Total white matter, total cortical grey matter, and subcortical grey matter volumes were used as predictors, with cognitive impairment (impairednot impaired, as classified by each method) as the outcome variable.\nRegarding diffusion metrics, we calculated the mean of each TOI (ATR, CING, UNC, CC) for each of the DTI metrics to obtain an overall average for MD, FA, RD, and AD. Pairwise Pearsons correlations between RD, AD, MD, and FA indicated that MD was highly correlated (r  0.90) with AD and RD. Because of this redundancy and because MD is used more widely in HIV studies (Stebbins et al. 2007;Su et al. 2015), AD and RD were dropped from the analysis. Methods used to analyze the DTI data were consistent with the methods used to analyze the volumetric data. We conducted 20 separate logistic regressions for each classification method, with overall average for MD and FA as predictor variables and cognitive impairment as the outcome variable.\nOverall model significance for the logistic regressions was calculated by investigating the difference in chi-square statistics and degrees of freedom between the null model (i.e., the model with only the constant term) and the model with the predictor variables. This approach allowed us to determine whether the deviance for the model with the predictors is significantly different from the model with only the constant term. False discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at  0.05 to correct for the multiple comparisons.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We identified, after a thorough literature search, eight different sets of criteria used by research studies to define cognitive impairment in PWH. These eight sets of criteria can be applied to neuropsychological test scores in different ways, resulting in 20 separate methods that can be used to classify PWH as impaired or unimpaired. Although it is not clear whether all of these methods have been used in the literature (many studies do not provide sufficient details of their analytic procedures), all are viable ways to classify cognitive impairment. After applying each method separately to our data (demographically adjusted T-scores from 148 South African PWH), we found that rates of cognitive impairment ranged from 20 to 97. We then sought to determine which of the 20 methods correlated best with neuroimaging biomarkers that served as proxies for HIV-brain pathology. The answer to this question would, we thought, provide guidance as to which method we might implement in our setting (a peri-urban South African township with high HIV prevalence, high levels of poverty and low levels of education; Smit et al. 2016;City of Cape Town 2013). However, no cognitive outcome was significantly associated with any neuroimaging outcome. The great variation in results depending on method used, and lack of any association between cognitive impairment and imaging biomarkers, raises interesting questions about the validity of these methods and interpretation of cognitive data in this population of PWH. Some variability in our observed rates arose from whether the chosen criteria for defining cognitive impairment were applied across individual test T-scores (i.e., each test score is considered separately) or across average domain T-scores. The choice of whether or not to calculate average domain T-scores is a decision researchers make early in the process of applying criteria for cognitive impairment. Of note here is that, within the current data, methods using average domain T-scores produced lower estimates of cognitive impairment and less variation. Some variability in our observed rates arose from how within-domain impairment was defined by different sets of criteria. For example, within the Frascati criteria, we applied three methods of indicating within-domain impairment: if performance on one test within a domain was  1 SD below normative mean, if performance on two tests within a domain was  1 SD below normative mean, and if an average domain T-score was  1 SD below the normative mean. These three approaches resulted in quite different estimated rates of cognitive impairment: 84, 35, and 45, respectively. Hence, even when the choice of criteria is consistent, the subsequent choice of how within-domain impairment is defined appears to produce inconsistent estimates of impairment.\nCriteria for defining cognitive impairment in PWH (and or applications of methods within those criteria) that lead to calculations of high rates risk overestimating the extent of the problem, leading to potential for unnecessary anxiety and stigma (Nightingale et al. 2014). Conversely, overly stringent methods risk missing some people who could benefit from help (Grant et al. 2014;Tierney et al. 2017). Our data suggest that calculating domain T-scores before applying criteria is preferable to applying criteria across individual test scores because the methods that calculate domain T-scores are slightly more stringent and substantially less variable. Calculating domain T-scores (or domain z-scores) before applying the method to define cognitive impairment is also more common in the literature and has been recommended as being a better approach (Meyer et al. 2013). Even if researchers choose different criteria to define cognitive impairment, consensus among researchers to calculate average domain T-scores will reduce the amount of variability that arises from different definitions of within-domain impairment, will ensure greater consistency and less variation in across-study reporting of rates, and will reduce the risk of prevalence overestimation.\nIn this study, the mean rate of cognitive impairment defined by the methods applied across average domain T-scores was 45, which is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of global HAND prevalence. The meta-analysis showed a mean HAND prevalence of 45 in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 43 overall (prevalence rates varied from 11-92; Wang et al. 2020). The mean rate of cognitive impairment defined by methods applied across individual test T-scores was higher (67) than the mean reported in the meta-analysis. It is possible that this indicates a higher rate of impairment in our population compared to some other studies or a tendency of this application of the methods to overestimate impairment.\nWe found no relationship between cognitive impairment (no matter which method defined it) and regional brain volumes or DTI metrics. One possible explanation for this lack of association is that regional brain volumes and DTI metrics are inaccurate proxies for HIV-related brain pathology for the population from which this sample was drawn. However, several studies have demonstrated the utility of MRI in this context (Heaps et al. 2012;Ortega et al. 2013;Paul et al. 2017) and cognitive impairment (as defined by various methods) has been associated with diffusion abnormalities and brain volumes in other cohorts from high-income countries (Alakkas et al. 2019;Campbell et al. 2020;Underwood et al. 2017Underwood et al. , 2019)). Unfortunately, studies with detailed neuroimaging data from PWH in low-income settings, such as ours, are scarce. One study conducted in Thailand also found no difference in brain volumes between those with or without cognitive impairment (as classified using Frascati criteria in a consensus case conference). In an attempt to explain this result, the authors indicated that the largest subgroup was comprised of participants classified with ANI, and that therefore their impaired cognitive performance may not be reflected in measures of brain pathology (Heaps et al. 2015). Those authors did find, however, that PWH had smaller regional brain volumes compared to HIV-negative individuals. Similarly, in another study conducted on same sample as the one studied here, PWH exhibited smaller total grey matter volumes and total white matter volumes compared to HIV-negative controls (Paul et al. 2017).\nBecause there are differences in brain volumes between PWH and controls, we assume that this metric can indicate HIV-related brain pathology, and that the classification methods themselves are limited in their ability to diagnose this. Therefore, another possible reason our analyses did not detect significant associations between cognitive impairment and neuroimaging outcomes is that test performance may be a poor indicator of HIV-related brain pathology in this population (i.e., test performance may be better explained by non-biological factors). Numerous previous studies have established that cognitive impairment in PWH can be multifactorial (Ciccarelli 2019;Torti et al. 2011). For instance, in communities with high levels of social and economic deprivation, socioeconomic factors can strongly influence cognitive test performance (see, e.g., Spies et al. 2016;Watson et al. 2019). Although we used normative data that was matched for demographic and educational characteristics to reduce the impact of such factors, we did not measure and control for all possible non-organic contributors to poor cognitive performance in vulnerable populations (e.g., low-quality education, food insecurity, poor access to resources, high levels of comorbidities, childhood trauma). Control for these sources of variation is, however, rare in HIV studies.\nThe results reported here should be considered with several limitations in mind. First, the methods used to define cognitive impairment involved analysis of cognitive test performance alone, without data from additional clinical measures such as subjective reports of cognitive symptoms or functional scales. Although assessment of functional impairment is a part of the application of, for instance, the Frascati criteria, many research studies do not include such assessment, and the minimum criteria for HAND is met without functional impairment (i.e. ANI). In the clinical setting, however, there is an emphasis on symptom reports (both from the patient themself and from collateral sources) and cognitive test performance is interpreted in the context of the patients presentation and estimates of premorbid functioning. This context can be lacking in research settings and may explain some of the lack of association between test performance and neuroimaging. Second, there are areas we did not consider which create the potential for further between-study variability in rates. These include how the normative data are derived and applied, how the cognitive domains are constructed, and the number of testssubtests included. We attempted to reduce the influence of these factors by processing the cognitive data according to best-practice means, or in ways consistent with most studies in the field. Third, our study sample was small and drawn from a specific periurban Cape Town population. Hence, it is unclear how the current findings extrapolate to PWH more broadly, in southern Africa and beyond. Fourth, the participants had recently started ART and the vast majority remained viraemic. Hence, this sample is not representative of the general population of clinic patients, most of whom are suppressed on effective ART. Finally, relationships between cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes are complex, and we did not investigate whether non-linear approaches (such as quantile regression analysis) might have detected a statistically significant relationship between the two.\nA consideration for future studies is that classification of cognitive performance into separate cognitive domains may be more sensitive than dichotomized outcomes (Phillips et al. 2018). In addition to investigating cognitive domains separately, investigation of specific brain volumes of interest (vs. whole-brain volumes) might be better able to tease out the differing effects of HIV and socioeconomic status on the brain (Lotze et al. 2020;Ortega et al. 2013;Yaple and Yu 2020). In addition, future studies should investigate the current question with regard to sex differences in cognitive functioning (i.e., whether some methods are more effective in defining cognitive impairment in womenmen).\nOverall, our results imply that perhaps no method of defining cognitive impairment in PWH that is based entirely on cognitive performance accurately reflects HIV-related brain pathology in this population, and that the high rates of cognitive impairment in this population may be attributed to non-biological causes. If none of the current methods used to define cognitive impairment are able to adequately identify HIV-related brain pathology in a setting such as ours, we may be misclassifying and over-estimating the prevalence rates of HIV-associated impairment in our population. This carries the risk of stigma and discrimination for an already marginalized group. Hence, as others (see, e.g. Ciccarelli 2019; Saloner and Cysique 2017) have highlighted, there is a need for updated research criteria, particularly for diverse low-and middle-income settings. Such criteria should (a) consider that performance on cognitive tests may bear a statistically non-significant relationship with HIV-related biological damage and (b) use clinical measures such as symptom report questionnaires and functional scales that gauge estimates of premorbid functioning and clinical progression alongside cognitive test performance to define cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is the strongest single gene predictor of Alzheimers disease (AD) and has been frequently associated with AD-related brain structural alterations before the onset of dementia. While previous research has primarily focused on hippocampal morphometry in relation to APOE, sporadic recent findings have questioned the specificity of the hippocampus and instead suggested more global effects on the brain. With the present study we aimed to investigate associations between homozygous APOE ε4 status and cortical gray matter structure as well as white matter microstructure. In our study, we contrasted n  31 homozygous APOE ε4 carriers (age  34.47 years, including a subsample of n  12 subjects with depression) with a demographically matched sample without an ε4 allele (resulting total sample: N  62). Morphometry analyses included a) Freesurfer based cortical segmentations of thickness and surface area measures and b) tract based spatial statistics of DTI measures. We found pronounced and widespread reductions in cortical surface area of ε4 homozygotes in 57 out of 68 cortical brain regions. In contrast, no differences in cortical thickness were observed. Furthermore, APOE ε4 homozygous carriers showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum, the right internal and external capsule, the left corona radiata and the right fornix. The present findings support a global rather than regionally specific effect of homozygous APOE ε4 allele status on cortical surface area and white matter microstructure. Future studies should aim to delineate the clinical implications of these findings.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that poses the leading cause for dementia Burns and Iliffe (2009) . AD is characterized by brain structural gray matter atrophy in cortical and subcortical structures, particularly in limbic, temporal, and frontal regions ( Wang et al., 2015 ), as well as white matter demyelination in the frontal lobe ( Chandra et al., 2018 ). There is evidence that both brain structural alterations and subclinical cognitive deficits appear already several years before the onset of dementia ( Johnson et al., 2009 ;Ries et al., 2008 ).\nHeritability estimates for AD go as high as h ²  0.58 ( Gatz et al., 2006 ), with the major single gene predictor being the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene ( Lambert et al., 2013 ). Possession of one APOE ε4 risk allele has been associated with a three-fold lifetime risk to develop AD, while possession of two ε4 risk alleles increases the risk 11-fold ( Corder et al., 1993 ;Farrer, 1997 ).\nGray matter reductions in non-demented mid-age and elderly APOE ε4 carriers have been repeatedly found in ADrelated regions such as the hippocampus ( Lemaître et al., 2005 ). Most of the previous research has mainly focused on APOE genotype effects on subcortical structures, particularly the hippocampal area. However, there have also been reports of investigations of APOE associations with cortical structures. APOE ε4 genotype has been related to thinner cortex in frontal and temporal regions in an elderly sample with mild cognitive impairment ( Liu et al., 2010 ). In contrast Habes et al. (2016) did not find APOE ε4 carriers to differ from non-ε4 carriers in regard to frontal, temporal or limbic regions of interest nor in regard to AD-associated brain atrophy patterns. However, ε4 hetero-and homozygotes were not distinguished in this studywhich makes a generalization to the high-risk ε4 homozygous genotype difficult.\nFurther, interactive effects of APOE genotype and cardiovascular disease have been proposed for total intracranial volume (TIV) decrease ( DeCarli et al., 1999 ), which in turn is expected to constitute a risk factor for AD ( Borenstein et al., 2005 ).\nAlthough TIV is frequently used as a covariate of no interest in structural brain analyses to correct for interindividual head size differences, so far it has received little attention as far as being a potential target of APOE effects. One study investigating brain atrophy in a large elderly nondemented sample found no effects of APOE genotype on TIV but regional reductions of the hippocampus and amygdala in ε4 carriers ( den Heijer et al., 2002 ).\nAs genetic pathway analysis implicated APOE in myelination processes as well as cerebral lipid processes ( Reinvang et al., 2013 ), there has been emerging interest in the study of its effect on white matter pathways in the brain. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI)-based measure of white matter microstructural integrity, has been associated with cognitive performance ( Repple et al., 2019 ). It has further been shown to be reduced in patients with several psychiatric ( Repple et al., 2020 ), and neurological disorders, especially AD ( Nir et al., 2013 ). Previous work showed inconsistent results with most studies demonstrating reduced FA in APOE carriers in an age independent manner ( Cavedo et al., 2017 ), while others failed to replicate this finding in middle-aged healthy subjects ( Bendlin et al., 2010 ).\nIn summary, the majority of findings point toward regional APOE associations with gray matter reduction mainly in subcortical structures as the hippocampus, as well as microstructure impairments in widespread major white matter tracts. Occasional reports about cortical structures also seem to involve regionally specific effects in the temporal and frontal regions. As the prevalence of ε4 homozygosity is very low (2.9) this high genetic risk group is dramatically underrepresented in studies investigating APOE effects ( Meyer et al., 1998 ). Most studies operationalize APOE genotype as the presence or absence of an ε4 allele (thus not differentiating ε4 hetero-and homozygotes), and therefore little is known about brain structural alterations related to ε4 homozygosity.\nWe recently presented findings that reductions in hippocampal volume in young to mid-age non-demented homozygous ε4 carriers vanished when controlling for TIV, suggesting that APOE effects in healthy adults might not be as regionally specific as previously hypothesized ( Goltermann et al., 2019 ). Regarding fiber structures it has been reported that 68 homozygous ε4 carriers (mean age 58.1 years) showed increased white matter diffusivity in widespread white matter tracts across the brain compared to non-ε4 carriers in a recent DTI-based study ( Operto et al., 2018 ). Among the affected tracts were the corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the corticospinal tract.\nApart from these occasional investigations, brain imaging studies on homozygous ε4 risk allele carriers are rare and it remains unclear if findings generalize to healthy mid-age adults. This study aims at filling the gap in the literature with a combined approach of analyzing gray matter surface area, cortical thickness and volume, and white matter microstructural integrity in a young to mid-age non-demented sample.\nSimilar brain structural alterations as related to the APOE genotype have also been implicated in research on major depressive disorder (MDD) ( Arnone et al., 2012 ). Further, longitudinal cohort studies suggest that APOE ε4 genotype is a risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms ( Skoog et al., 2015 ). Despite this overlap there is little research about APOE effects on brain structure in MDD samples. Thus, an MDD subsample is additionally included in the current study in order to investigate potential interaction effects between APOE genotype and psychiatric diagnosis.\nBased on the previous studies in heterozygous ε4 risk allele carriers, we hypothesize reductions in cortical thickness, surface area, brain volume, and white matter integrity in ε4 homozygotes. Further, we explore the potential influence of MDD diagnosis to this relationship.",

      "text": "Participant description has been similarly described in our previous publication ( Goltermann et al., 2019 ). In brief, a sample of N  1141 adult subjects with complete MRI and neuropsychological data was available from the FOR2107 Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort Study (MACS) which includes subjects with MDD and healthy control (HC) subjects ( Kircher et al., 2019 ). Exclusion criteria were any history of neurological (e.g., concussion, stroke, tumor, neuro-inflammatory diseases) and medical (e.g., cancer, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, infections) conditions. The study sample was selected based on the genotype of the APOE gene. Within the FOR2107 MACS cohort a study sample of n  31 homozygous ε4 carriers was available which was contrasted with n  31 non-ε4 carriers that were matched for age, gender, and diagnosis. A case-wise matching approach was used, yielding almost identical distributions of control variables across genotype groups.\nThe final sample of N  62 included n  24 MDD patients and n  38 HC subjects (equally distributed across both genotype groups). The mean age of the sample was 34.47 years ( SD  13.48), ranging from 19 to 63 years with 51.6 of the sample being female. For Freesurfer analyses a sample of N  60 ( n  30 ε4 homozygotes; n  30 matched non-ε4 controls) was included due to missing data. A detailed description of the distribution of demographic characteristics can be found in Table 1 .\nSubjects from the MACS cohort were recruited and data was collected at the Departments of Psychiatry either at the University of Marburg or at the University of Münster. All participants received a financial compensation. A structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) was conducted with each participant in order to assess psychopathological diagnoses ( Wittchen et al., 1997 ). All MDD subjects fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for an acute or lifetime major depressive episode. All HC subjects were ensured to be free from presence or any history of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV criteria.",

High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired for all participants. Pulse sequence parameters were harmonized across scanner sites to the extent permitted by each platform. Detailed imaging and quality assurance protocols of the MACS are described elsewhere ( Vogelbacher et al., 2018 ).\nFor DTI imaging, fifty-six axial slices, with a thickness of 2.5 mm with no gap, were measured with an isotropic voxel size of 2.5  2.5  2.5 mm ³ (TE  90 ms, TR  7300 ms). Five non-DW images ( b 0  0) and 2  30 DW images with a b -value of 1000 smm ² were acquired. To ensure data quality, all raw DTI and FA images were visually inspected.

In order to explore potential interaction effects between genotype group with MDD diagnosis, age, and sex separate GLMs were set up with respective interaction terms. Subsequently identical GLMs were conducted for cortical thickness and cortical surface area in each Freesurfer region in order to explore region-specific cortical differences between genotype groups. Regional thickness and surface area measures served as the dependent variables for each specific model. An FDR correction following the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ) was applied to all of these 136 regional comparisons ( q  0.05) in order to control for alpha error accumulation. Partial η² ( η² p ) was obtained as a measure of effect size for all models.\nDifferences between genotype groups in FA were established using GLMs implemented in FSL randomize, correcting for age, sex, group, site and TIV ( Takao et al., 2014 ). For further exploratory interaction analyses, mean FA values from the significant clusters were extracted and entered into a GLM within SPSS to investigate genotype  diagnosis, genotype  age, or genotype  sex interactions.\nStatistical analyses on the demographic data as well as all Freesurfer-based analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, the main finding is a detrimental impact of homozygous APOE ε4 genotype on widespread cortical surface area, and on white matter integrity in a non-demented young-to mid-age sample.\nSegmentation-based gray matter analyses revealed reduced surface area in ε4 homozygotes across the large majority of cortical brain regions (descriptively this pattern was observed across all regions). Largest effect sizes were obtained in frontal and temporal regions that reflect cortical regions prominently affected in AD ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Temporal as well as frontal regions have both been implicated in the prediction of longitudinal conversion to AD ( Dickerson et al., 2011 ). and furthermore temporal lobe reductions have been previously linked to APOEspecific atrophic processes in AD ( Filippini et al., 2009 ). Reduced gray matter volume in the temporal lobe of ε4 heterozygous carriers can already be shown in neonates ( Knickmeyer et al., 2014 ). The entorhinal cortex has received particularly much attention as it has been suggested to be one of the earliest structures affected in AD ( Chandra et al., 2018 ), and to be a reliable biomarker for future AD ( Nestor et al., 2004 ).\nIn contrast to previous studies, that present rather specific brain structural biomarkers of AD and APOE genotype particularly in temporal regions, our results indicate a rather widespread effect of APOE in young to mid-age participants that are ε4-homozygous. Notably, in our sample the association of ε4 homozygosity with global cortical surface and TIV were descriptively larger as compared to age effects for this sample. Further, although genotype effects on global cortical measures were highly comparable across hemispheres, there were descriptive lateralized differences in regional effects (e.g. larger effects in left supramarginal, fusiform, and rostral anterior cingulate gyrus).\nThese findings may point to potential asymmetric effects of APOE genotype as previously discussed ( Donix et al., 2013 ). However, as this was not the main focus of the present work and due to the small sample size, potential asymmetry effects should be further investigated in future studies.\nUnexpectedly, in our sample out of all cortical regions the entorhinal cortex was one of the few regions whose surface area did not differ between genotype groups. Regarding cortical thickness we even observed smaller values in the entorhinal region of non-ε4 carriers as compared to ε4 homozygotes. This unintuitive finding may be accounted for by differences in sample characteristics as age, coding of zygosity, and current neurological condition, as most studies investigate elderly samples (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or AD samples) and do not differentiate between ε4 homo-and heterozygosity. Also, we included a subsample of subjects with a depression which poses another difference to most other research. Previous researchers have suggested complex dynamics of APOE effects on brain structure over the life span ( Cherbuin et al., 2007 ). Thus, although we do not find the entorhinal cortex to be affected by APOE ε4 homozygosity in our sample, this cannot be generalized to samples sufficiently powered in differing age ranges or to samples with mild cognitive impairment or AD.\nInterestingly, while effects for surface area were extensive, we could not detect any hypothesized effects on cortical thickness, which suggests a more specific association of APOE and surface area. This finding fits with previous evidence suggesting that cortical surface area is to a slightly greater extent genetically determined as compared to cortical thickness ( Eyler et al., 2019 ), although that may only partly account for differences in results between surface area and thickness in our study. Similarly, developmental trajectories over the lifespan have been reported to differ between cortical surface and thickness measures ( Hogstrom et al., 2013 ;Wierenga et al., 2014 ). Notably, consistent with our results, recent findings from a large genotyping study suggest that genetic loci are to a greater extent associated with cortical surface as compared to thickness measures, and that genetic effects on surface area are induced by a larger variety of genetic loci ( Grasby et al., 2020 ). Future studies should explore potential links between the APOE genotype, brain-aging, and cortical trajectories. However, up to now, studies investigating APOE genotype and brain-aging, as well as studies comparing these cortical parameters in the context of APOE homozygosity are lacking.\nThe findings of reduced FA are found in two major clusters, which include both hemispheres as well as several major white matter tracts like the corpus callosum, the internal and external capsule and the corona radiata therefore connecting bihemispheric frontal and temporal regions as well as cortical regions with the brainstem. This is in line with several DTI studies in healthy APOE heterozygous ε4 carriers and supports a concept of a global adverse effect of ε4 genotype on widespread white matter pathways, rather than specific, localized effects ( Cavedo et al., 2017 ). Of note, this pattern is already present in a relatively young (mean age  34.5) group of homozygotes, corroborating the widespread results of a recent study with an older (mean age  58.1) sample of homozygotes ( Operto et al., 2018 ).\nBoth, our findings in regard to smaller cortical surface area and reduced FA in ε4 homozygotes did not differ between our MDD subsample and our HC sample. Although, this may be due to insufficient statistical power these findings suggest that ε4 homozygosity is associated with brain structure rather independent of the psychiatric diagnosis of MDD.\nAs shown in our previous work ( Goltermann et al., 2019 ), these young to mid-age, healthy homozygous ε4 carriers already perform poorer on visuospatial working memory tasks. This effect could be mediated by our findings of widespread gray and white matter alterations in this group, as both cortical gray matter volume ( Pantel et al., 2004 ), as well as white matter integrity have been associated with working memory performance ( Repple et al., 2019 ).\nAn important limitation of our study is that the data investigated are cross-sectional in nature and future longitudinal studies need to investigate whether observed structural abnormalities are constant over the lifespan or follow a trajectory with a faster deterioration and more pronounced differences with increasing age in APOE ho-mozygous carriers compared to non-carriers. The size of our sample poses one of the greatest strengths of our study, as well as an important limitation. Although, we present a very large sample of ε4 homozygotes as compared to previous samples, from a statistical point of view the sample size has to be estimated as rather small. Thus, the reliability of our findings should be tested in replications in comparable samples of ε4 homozygotes. Moreover, associations with symptom profiles ( Sun et al., 2019 ) need to be addressed in larger samples. The relatively modest statistical power may also contribute to the non-significant interaction between the APOE ε4 homozygous genotype and either age or sex in our study. Previous evidence suggests that APOE effects on brain structure are differently featured in females and males and also across the life span ( Espeseth et al., 2008 ;Sampedro et al., 2015 ). These interactive effects may be too small to be detected in our sample.\nIn summary, APOE e4 homozygous allele carriers show widespread and global impairments both in white matter integrity and cortical gray matter surface in young to mid-age adults, which could be a risk factor for the future development of mild cognitive impairment and AD. Future studies should investigate the potential clinical translation of these findings.",

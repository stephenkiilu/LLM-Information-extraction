    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has been able to detect early structural changes related to neurological symptoms present in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, there is still a knowledge gap to interpret the biological significance at early neuropathological stages. The purpose of this study is two-fold: (i) establish if the combination of Ultra-High Field Diffusion MRI (UHFD-MRI) techniques can add a more comprehensive analysis of the early microstructural changes observed in HD, and (ii) evaluate if early changes in dMRI microstructural parameters can be linked to cellular biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Ultra-high field magnet (16.7T), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) techniques were applied to fixed ex-vivo brains of a preclinical model of HD (R61 mice). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was decreased in deep and superficial grey matter (GM) as well as white matter (WM) brain regions with well-known early HD microstructure and connectivity pathology. NODDI parameters associated with the intracellular and extracellular compartment, such as intracellular ventricular fraction (ICVF), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and isotropic volume fractions (IsoVF) were altered in R61 mice GM. Further, histological studies in these areas showed that glia cell markers associated with neuroinflammation (GFAP  Iba1) were consistent with the dMRI findings. dMRI can be used to extract non-invasive information of neuropathological events present in the early stages of HD. The combination of multiple imaging techniques represents a better approach to understand the neuropathological process allowing the early diagnosis and neuromonitoring of patients affected by HD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease most recognized by slow and progressive abnormal movements described in detail by George Huntington ( Walker, 2007 ) in the 19th century . HD is associated with a distinctive phenotype, including chorea and dystonia, discoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioral difficulties. The genetic mutation of the huntingtin ( HTT ) gene is responsible for an atypically long polyglutamine (poly Q) expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) protein ( Finkbeiner, 2011 ). Such polyQ expansion (more than 35 CAG repeats) makes HTT prone to misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation ( Zheng and Diamond, 2012 ). Eventually, this leads to neurodegeneration, particularly in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the grey matter (GM) nuclei of the striatum (STR) which has been well described ( Vonsattel et al., 1985 ). HD is particularly devastating due to its multiple cognitive features, with a relentless course of over 10-20 years. Early HD symptoms have been attributed to impairment of the frontal cerebral cortex (particularly layers III, V, and VI) ( Zheng and Diamond, 2012 ). However, new evidence suggests that other brain areas might be also involved, particularly the hippocampus, which has been under analysis in different mouse models and HD patients ( Begeti et al., 2016 ;Harris et al., 2019 ;Quirion and Parsons, 2019 ). Unfortunately, there are no current therapeutic strategies to stop or slow down the disease progression, and fatality frequently occurs about 20 years after diagnosis ( Roze et al., 2010 ).\nAdvancements in MRI techniques have opened a new window of preclinical microstructural exploration in neuroanatomical regions particularly susceptible to HD ( Shim et al., 2019 ). Current improvements in gradient fields and imaging resolution have been able to non-invasively capture features, with improved accuracy in vivo and ex vivo at the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases ( Gatto et al., 2018a ;Gatto et al., 2018b ;Muller et al., 2020 ). The development of new diffusion MRI techniques has opened a new realm with a great number of parameters associated with microstructural anomalies in HD ( Rosas et al., 2006 ). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a mono-exponential Gaussian imaging technique, has been applied to obtain parameters mostly related to WM changes during the disease in mouse models ( Douaud et al., 2009 ;Gatto, Rodolfo G. et al., 2020 ;Magnotta et al., 2009 ), whereas other more complex models like neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) are contributing with additional information in different diseases at the clinical level ( Kamiya et al., 2020 ), with few but growing number of examples in the context of HD preclinical models. Thus, a more comprehensive approach combining the different diffusion MRI techniques could be applied to increase our understanding of the intricate cellular changes in the early stages of HD.\nMurine models are the most widely used to study HD, based on their availability and practical use ( Figiel et al., 2012 ;Switonski et al., 2012 ). Initial manipulation of the transgenic founder line (R6 mouse) led to the R61 mice that express exon 1 of the human gene ( HTT ) carrying a 115 CAG repeat, previously characterized and widely used to test therapeutic compounds ( Naver et al., 2003 ). Aggregatesinclusions have been detected in the striatum at about 8 weeks of age ( Li et al., 2005 ). No qualitative evidence of massive cell death in the R61 mice was detected in the model ( Naver et al., 2003 ). A longitudinal study showed that overall, striatal, cortical, and hippocampal volumes were different between WT and R61 mice. Additionally, agerelated deficits in both motor and cognitive behaviors were detectable by 11 weeks of age. However, no association between mHTT load and MRI-based regional brain changes were identified ( Rattray et al., 2013 ). The slower progression of the disease in the R61 mouse makes it more suitable for investigating the long-term effects of treatments, as well as for analyzing changes in both, the presymptomatic as well as in the symptomatic state ( Gatto and Weissmann, 2019 ). Thus, the evaluation of these models using different imaging techniques in the field of HD could help interpret MRI findings and early neuropathological mechanisms.\nOne of the central mechanisms involved in HD neuronal death is neuroinflammation; reactive inflammatory processes are one of the most studied at the early stages of HD ( Politis et al., 2015 ). The activation of the components of the glia, particularly astrocytes with HTT inclusions have been detected and related to alterations in HD ( Cisbani and Cicchetti, 2012 ). Thus, the evaluation of early associated neuroinflammatory biomarkers in physiological intact organisms is paramount to move research in this field forward. Overall, the purpose of this study is two-fold: (i) combine different diffusion techniques to agive a more comprehensive insight into the early microstructural changes observed in HD; (ii) evaluate if early microstructural changes are linked to cellular markers of neuroinflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using microstructural multi-modality imaging methods in the R61 transgenic animal model of HD.",

      "text": "All animal procedures were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as adopted by the US National Institutes of Health, the Mexican Regulation of Animal Care and Maintenance (NOM-062- ZOO-1999ZOO- , 2001)), and in agreement with internal Cinvestav regulations. Mice had easy access to food and water and were checked daily to assess their level of well-being and health. Mice had ad libitum access to food and water in aseptic conditions with climate and light-controlled system and were checked daily to assess their level of well-being and health. R61 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (stock 002809) with a C57BJ6 background, overexpressing 115  6 CAG repeats. Mice were genotyped by end-point PCR based on previous protocols ( Segovia, 2002 ). To amplify the mutant fragment of the human huntingtin gene we used the following primers: forward 5 ǴCA GCA GCA GCA GCA ACA GCC GCC ACC GCC, and reverse 5 ĆGG CTG AGG CAG CAG CGG CTGT. To reproduce our results with more biological accuracy (as well as for future translational and reproducibility purposes), a mixed pool of male and female mice was used in this study, as has been previously done ( Beery, 2018 ;Xiang et al., 2011 ). The R61 mice have been previously characterized and they develop motor symptoms between 14 to 20 weeks of age and die around 48 weeks ( Ferrante, 2009 ). After a proper review of the literature, among the two-common method of sample size calculation in animal studies ( Charan J et al 2013 ), A power analysis approach was used to calculate the sample size for a significance level (type 1 error) fixed at the level of 5( p  0.05) and a power ( β)  0.80 ( Charan and Kantharia, 2013 ;Dattalo, 2018 ).\nTo disentangle alterations due to HD progression from normal aging, we initially considered two control groups of C57BJ6 mice to match the experimental groups at the early presymptomatic stage of 11 weeks (P77), and a late R61 symptomatic group at postnatal week 30 (P320) with a total of 16 animals used: wild type (WT) controls and R61 mice (n  4 per group). No significant differences were detected between both control groups.",

Brain stacks (3) were placed in 10 mm diameter NMR tubes (New Era NEML10-7, 30 0-40 0 MHz) and the tubes were filled with fluorocarbon oil (Fluorinert, 3M, Maplewood, MN) and gently stabilized using coronoid tips. Three (3) 10mm tubes were gently placed in a 25mm coil. Images from all brains were acquired with a 17.6 T vertical-bore Avance II scanner using a 25-mm RF coil, Micro-2.5 gradients, and Paravision 6.0 software (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany).

      "text": "Two (2) MRI scans sessions (involving 6 mice brains each) were performed (total mouse brains N  12). Three (3) experimental groups (WT pre and symptomatic control, R61(11weeks presymptomatic), and R61 symptomatic (30 weeks), coronally centered and oriented along the rostral-caudal axis of each brain (n  4 per animal group). A total of 170 MRI slices were acquired using a spin-echo sequence with TR  10 0 0 0 ms and TE  20 ms, interleaved 0.2 mm thick slices, with a field of view  25  25  34 mm 3 in each block of slices, in-plane acquisition matrix  125  125  170, for an isotropic image resolution of 200 microns, b  0 smm 2 for each shell: b  10 0 0 smm 2 in 20 directions, and b  2500 smm 2 in 64 directions, with 3.5 ms duration ( δ) and 11 ms of separation ( ) of the gradient pulses. This acquisition was averaged twice for a total time of approximately 19 hrs. per set in the cool bore (20 degrees Celsius) of the 17.6 T magnet (750 MHz89 mm Bruker Avance III HD). Due to the potential hardware vibrations, and field inhomogeneity, susceptibility corrections were performed. All the DWIs to the baseline image (b0), correction of the eddy currents, as well as motion and artifacts corrections were accounted for using standard preprocessing procedures ( Andersson et al., 2003 ;Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016 ). DTI parameters data processing was performed using FSL ( Jenkinson et al., 2012 ) to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA).\nFor NODDI calculations, we followed the MATLAB scripts provided in ( Zhang et al., 2012 ). For NODDI fitting, the initial condition for the intrinsic diffusivity (D in ) of the neural tissue was set to 0.6  10 -3 mm 2 s, particularly optimized for an overall murine brain tissue as described in earlier work ( Wang et al., 2019 ). A default value of isotropic diffusivity (2.0  10 -3 mm2s) was used for D iso value as indicated in previous studies ( Holz et al.,20 0 0 ). Applying equations already implemented in the original MATLAB algorithms in ex vivo fixed tissue, an additional dot-compartment (diffusion is restricted in all directions) was included for the fitting ( Dhital et al., 2018 ). Manual segmentation, volumetric calculations, and diffusivity parameters were acquired for three different brain structures: a) Superficial GM cortical areas (superficial GM), b) subcortical areas (deep GM); and c) WM tracts, using ITK-SNAP ( www.itksnap.org ) ( Yushkevich et al., 2006 ;Yushkevich et al., 2016 ). Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined following stereotaxic coordinates and landmarks presented by the Paxinos mouse brain atlas ( Paxinos and Franklin, 2004 ). Four (4) superficial GM ROIs areas were selected; frontal accessory cortical area (FrAc), the Cingular cortex (Cing), the primary motor cortex (M1), and the supplementary motor cortex (M2). Two (2) deep GM areas were selected; the striatum (STR) and the hippocampus (HC). Additionally, we analyzed the corpus callosum (CC), a WM area generally affected by HD disease ( Gatto and Weissmann, 2019 ;Phillips et al., 2013 ;Phillips et al., 2014 ).\nFor tractography reconstructions and exploration purposes, a multi-shell diffusion scheme was used, with the b-values of 10 0 0 and 2500 smm 2 and sampling directions used were 20, and 20, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 0.15 mm. The slice thickness was 0.15 mm. The b-table was checked by an automatic quality control routine to ensure its accuracy ( Schilling et al., 2019 ). The diffusion tensor was calculated. A deterministic fiber tracking algorithm ( Yeh et al., 2013 ) was used. A seeding region was placed at the whole brain with a volume size of 4.2e  02 mm 3. The ROI was placed in the striatum region with a volume size of 5 mm 3 . The anisotropy threshold was 0.0960938. The angular threshold was 90 degrees. The step size was randomly selected from 0.5 to 1.5 voxels. The fiber trajectories were smoothed by averaging the propagation direction with a percentage of the previous direction. The percentage was randomly selected from 0 to 95. Tracks with a length shorter than 0 or longer than 20 mm were discarded. A total of 50 0 0 0 seeds were placed. ROIs were used for brain parcellation, and the connectivity matrix was calculated by using the count of the connecting tracks. The connectivity matrix and graph theoretical anal-ysis was conducted using DSI Studio ( http:dsi-studio.labsolver. org ).",

After embedding in optical cutting temperature (OCT) polymer compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura, Finetek, cat 4583), 50 μm thick brain sections were obtained using a microtome (Leica cryostat CM 1850 Cryostat, Buffalo Grove, IL). Brain sections were mounted on slides and dried for 15 minutes. Then, the OCT was removed by washing three times with Tris base buffer (TBS) and permeabilized with 0.25 Triton x-100 (20 min) and treated with blocking solution (1 BSA, 0.01 Triton x-100 in TBS) for an hour at room temperature (RT). Slides were incubated then with the primary antibody overnight in blocking solution, washed in TBS, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 60 min in blocking buffer. After washing, slides were incubated in propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min to detect nuclei. After a final wash in TBS, slides were dried and mounted in Vecta-Shield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acid proteins (GFAP) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark; 1:700), mouse monoclonal against (Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (anti-Iba1) (Wako, 019-19741, 1:200). PI (Molecular Probes) 20 mM was used in a solution 10 uM in TBS containing Tx-100 (0.01) and RNAse.\nCortical and hippocampal images in mice were acquired with an Olympus FV300BX61 microscope. Alexa-647 and Alexa-488conjugated secondary antibodies, and PI were excited using Argon (lambda: 488 nm), Helium-Neon (lambda: 543 nm), Helium-Neon (lambda: 633 nm) lasers, and a transmission light detector as previously described ( Castellanos et al., 2020 ). For quantitative experiments, identical laser power and acquisition settings were used. Representative histological sections were selected matching stereotaxic coordinates using MRI brain imaging (The Mouse Brain: 1 st Ed, Watson  Paxinos, 2008). Measurements were done using open-source ImageJ software ( Collins, 2007 ;Schneider et al., 2012 ). Mean intensity values were used for quantitative purposes. Four representatives (4) ROIs from four (4) consecutive immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides (n  16 ROIs) were selected for analysis ( Gatto, R. G. et al., 2020 ). In the case of CA1, CA3, and DG areas, ROIs were selected from the PI channel to determine the different layers (pyramidalis, radiata) and mean grey values obtained (background corrected) from the antibody channel (n  15-20 ROIs) in an analysis similar to that performed by Ugolino et al. ( Ugolini et al., 2018 ). For fractal and branch analysis, we used the plugin FracLac and Skeleton respectively in ImageJ. The analysis performed was similar to that described by Young et al ( Young and Morrison, 2018 ). Representative fluorescent micrographs were increased in brightness and contrast equally for all conditions (WT, presymptomatic, and symptomatic) to visually show the differences mentioned in the legends.",

In specific WM regions, like the corpus callosum (CC), a significant reduction was attained only in the R61 symptomatic group (WT-11wks  13.7  0.5 mm 3 vs R61 (30wks)  11.1  0.4 mm 3 , p  0.02) (18.97  decrease). In deep GM regions, like the striatum (STR) and hippocampus (HC), only significant changes were seen in the symptomatic stages (STR, WT-11wks  33.7  2.62 mm 3 vs. R61 (30wks)  24.9  2.4 mm 3 , p  0.04), (HC, WT-11wks)  22.0  0.3 mm 3 vs. R61 (30wks)  18.3  1.3 mm 3 , p  0.03) with a decrease of 26.1 and 16.8 respectively. Changes were also detected in M1 and M2 motor cortex areas at the symptomatic stage. In other areas of the cortex (CCX), such as the frontal accessory (FrAc) (WT-11wks  13.9  2.3 mm 3 vs R61 (11wks)  7.35  0.45 mm 3 , p  0.02) (47.1 decrease), and cingulate cortex (Cing) (WT-11wks  7.57  0.52 mm 3 vs R61 (11wks)  5.0  0.57 mm 3 , p  0.01) (33.97 decrease), significant presymptomatic volumetric decreases were accounted for. Additional normalization of each brain structure by the total brain volume on each experimental group and effect size analysis ( Daly and Cohen, 1987 ;Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1984 ) is shown in Supplementary Table 1. These results show that the R61 model depicts changes as already described in other HD mouse models and was further analyzed.",

However, no other significant changes in FA were detected in the CC body or splenium regions. Analysis of the striatum showed a spread increase of FA across the entire region as the disease progressed towards the symptomatic stage ( Figs. 4 and5 b). Moreover, the hippocampus showed an early initial localized FA decrease in the middle (labeled as HC plane 2 in Fig. 1 ) spreading to its entire region at the symptomatic stage ( Figs. 4 and5 c). Cortical FrAc and Cing regions ( Figs. 4 and5 d), presented a broader change between normal and disease groups at the very early presymptomatic period fundamentally located to the more anterior portions of the brain. Cortical areas, as the M1 and M2, showed more modest and localized early reductions in FA as well. A more detailed account of DTI derivatives from the segmented ROIs, including axial (AD  λ 1 ), radial (RD  λ 2  λ 3 )2, and mean diffusivity (MD  λ 1  λ 2  λ 3 )3) are described in Table 1 .

    "Early cellular neuroinflammatory structural biomarkers in the R61 mouse brain": {
      "text": "The presence of early glia anomalies in HD has been documented in previous work. In this preclinical model, we evaluated the presence of GFAP as a maker to track astrocytes. Our studies found increased levels of this protein as the disease progressed, in susceptible structures, such as the CCX, CC, and STR of the presymptomatic R61 mice compared to the WT control ( Fig. 9 ac). These results were larger in the middle HC region, particularly in early stages ( Fig. 9 d).\nA more thorough examination of the different regions of the HCs is shown in Fig. 10 . The HC was subdivided into different areas, and ROIs in each were established to determine the intensity of the GFAP signal, the number of astrocytes, and morphological alterations ( Fig. 10 a-c). The plots show that the intensity of the GFAP signal was higher in all areas (CA1, CA3, and hilus) for the symptomatic animals. Interestingly, the CA3 area showed the highest GFAP signal for presymptomatic animals, similar to what was observed for FA values in HC middle portions ( Figs. 5 and6 ). We focused on the CA3 area for further analysis. A higher density of astrocytes was evidenced in the R61 presymptomatic mice compared to the WT control or symptomatic counterparts ( Fig. 10 b,bottom). Additionally, we performed a structural analysis using skeletonizations and fractals to compare the cell morphologies ( Fig. 10 c, explained in materials and methods). The parameters obtained, the fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity (L), offer a way of quantifying and comparing geometrical complexity ( Di Leva, 2016 ), and have been used extensively in the field of neuroscience as well as many others ( Kapitulnik and Deutscher, 1984 ). In general terms, a higher FD reflects a higher irregularity, while L complements the analysis yielding a measure of heterogeneity. The representative astrocyte images show a higher FD (fractal dimension) and L (lacunarity) in the R61 compared to WT-11wks mice evidencing a higher level of complexity, even at the presymptomatic stage.\nThe microglia (stained with Iba1) has been documented as playing a role at the later stages of HD ( Palpagama et al., 2019 ). Results from our analysis confirmed this with a significant increase in the levels of the marker located in the medial areas of the HC at the presymptomatic stage of the R61 compared to the WT-11wks control mice ( Fig. 11 ).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This work has revealed early changes in dMRI microstructural parameters in the R61 HD mouse model and associated the findings with cellular biomarkers of neuroinflammation. At the macrostructural level, changes in volumes detected in this work ( Fig. 2 ) are in line with those determined in HD patients, and documented in other HD mouse models, like the zQ175 ( Heikkinen et al., 2012 ) and previous work in the R61 mice ( Hansson et al., 1999 ). Other HD mouse models show volumetric changes as well. In the case of the R62 model, changes were detected via MRI in symptomatic animals, CCX, STR, and HC, but not in presymptomatic animals ( Cepeda-Prado et al., 2012 ). Volume loss was also detected in the HdH150Q mouse brain at preand post-symptomatic stages ( Steventon et al., 2016 ). In this study, R61 mice mimic changes described in clinical HD, with a volume loss of about 23 in total cortical GM ( Halliday et al., 2009 ), and highest in STR nuclei ( Ruocco et al., 2006 ).\nAn increase in HD ventricular size is another main feature described in HD ( Hobbs et al., 2010 ). Likewise, preclinical studies in rodent models of NDDs have shown that the detection of changes in ventricular size measured by UHF-MRI is feasible. In clinical longitudinal MRI studies, Hobbs et al. estimated that HD ventricular volumes (adjusted for normal aging, sex, and total intracranial volume) increased more than in control groups, only one year before the onset of motor deficits ( Hobbs et al., 2010 ). This short window of presymptomatic detection agrees with our findings ( Fig. 3 ), where no significant changes in the R61 mouse were seen at an earlier stage of the disease. This finding confirms the fact that ventricular size is not a reliable bioimaging marker to predict HD at earlier stages. At the microstructural level, (among the effects associated with the presence of mutant HTT), the loss of axonal connectivity (AC) is one of the earliest and main pathological events described in HD ( Cowan and Raymond, 2006 ;Sieradzan and Mann, 2001 ). This AC loss can be visualized further with the use of MRI techniques in preclinical models, like the R61 mice ( Table 3 ). dMRI has shown that DTI can evaluate brain injury and reveal changes in brain microstructure ( Gupta et al., 2008 ;Gupta et al., 2010 ;Gupta et al., 2012 ). FA values reported in this work ( Figs. 5 and6 ) agree with the literature: as the progression of the disease relates to structure disorganization, we found lower FA values in WM and superficial GM structures -as well as opposite increased FA values in deep GM nuclei (STR). The unexpected increase of FA in the striatum might reflect a coherent breakdown of different grey and white matter constituents (e.g., microstructure simplification, cytoskeleton degeneration, myelin breakdown, loss of cortical axons ( Fazio et al., 2018 ). Also, as Douaud et al suggested, an atypical increase of FA could be the result of the selective loss of some of the subcortical connections targeted by the degenerative processi.e., mainly the striatopallidal projections at an early stage of the disease that may turn the striatum into a seemingly more organized structure ( Douaud et al., 2009 ) and reviewed before ( Gatto and Weissmann, 2019 ). This reinforces the validity of the R61 as a model to further evaluate changes in HD. Moreover, specific delineation of anterior to posterior regions, within the structures of interest detected the longitudinal progression of the disease. Changes in neuronal connectivity can be reflected in WM orientations, probably related to a balance of several factors such as neurodegeneration and microstructure reorganization, as well as neuroplastic events ( Gatto, 2020b ). This is also detected in this study by the significant changes in DTI parameters (FA) and changes in the histological compartments determined by NODDI (ICVF and particularly ODI). This new information can improve our understanding of the topographic evolution of the disease and network alterations at the different stages ( Fig. 7 ), as described in other preclinical models of HD ( Chang et al., 2018 ).\nAnomalies described by DTI can be connected to AC changes ( Table 1 ). However, the study of neuroinflammation requires a dual intra and extracellular analysis. In the NODDI model, ODI parameters (and by extension ICVF and IsoVF scalars) have been directly related to the loss of connectivity and neuroinflammation phenomena. As an example, Yi et al. showed that the increased presence of microglia in the extra-neurite space contributed to alterations in water diffusivity, particularly detected in ODI values ( Yi et al., 2019 ). An extra-neuronal compartment upsurge (based on an increase in ODI values) in the context of microglia infiltration, would be somehow difficult to explain. In this work, NODDI results reproduced the compartmental redistribution measured by ICVF and ODI in other NDDs ( Gatto et al., 2018c ) ( Table 2 ). The alteration of other parameters associated with an increase of free water in the interstitial space (IsoVF) could more accurately represent the increase in interstitial water associated with inflammatory processes. This has been described in other neurodegenerative diseases ( Gatto et al., 2018c ) and depicted in ( Fig. 8 b).

Note that FA values from R61 (11wks) and R61 (30wks) are compared to their respective controls WT-11wks and WT-30wks. Our work detected a marked change in the diffusion change in the middle portion of the HC at a presymptomatic stage. The same area showed changes as detected in our histological studies using neuroinflammatory markers and centered in the HC middle portion, particularly in the CA3 region ( Fig. 9 ). Glial (and diffusion) changes in HC could relate to cognitive alterations documented in clinical and rodent models, showing an increase of GFAP levels in CA1, CA3, and DG regions ( Bondan et al., 2019 ). Additionally, studies have shown that structures such as the HC are particularly sensitive to the harmful effects of neuroinflammatory mechanisms in synaptic plasticity ( Mancini et al., 2017 ). Detailed histological analysis in HC showed changes in astrocyte morphology, a common pathological feature preceding structural deficits that may drive disease progression. Astrocytes undergo a series of morphological and functional changes (overall described as astrogliosis) mainly characterized by swelling of the cell body, presence of larger and thicker processes, as well as increasing GFAPexpression ( Pirici et al., 2009 ). Also, this cell type expresses AQP-4 channels and thus their role in water uptake as has been described for other NDDs ( Gatto et al., 2018a ). Specifically, in HD, astrocytes show inclusions of mutant HTT (mHTT) proteins that have been related to alterations of its components ( Cisbani and Cicchetti, 2012 ;Shin et al., 2005 ). This alone was shown to trigger HD pathology in mice that overexpress mHTT exclusively in astrocytes ( Bradford et al., 2010 ).",

      "text": "In our MRI experiments, isoVF showed alterations in HC middle portions at the early stages; interestingly, as mentioned before, histology showed that GFAP increased levels were also prominent particularly in CA3 areas of the HC together with an increase in astrocyte complexity. Likewise, differences in GFAP levels in different areas of HC were also described for Alzheimers disease (AD) transgenic mice compared to the WT counterpart ( Ugolini et al., 2018 ), and a change in astrocytic morphology was reported also in some brain structures of the R62 mice ( Vorisek et al., 2017 ). In previous work, astrocytes have been analyzed via the fractal dimension (FD) technique in different preclinical ( Reichenbach et al., 1992 ), and clinical studies ( Pirici et al., 2009 ). In our studies, we found that different conditions (control, presymptomatic and symptomatic mice) bore differences in astrocytic morphological patterns ( Fig. 10 ).\nPFA fixation has an impact on diffusion parameters. As an example, clinical studies have shown that formalin fixation promotes a decrease in MRI relaxometry (T1 and T2), and a decrease in myelin water fraction (MWF) measurements, but accounting for minimal changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters such FA and mean diffusivity, (MD) ( Shatil et al., 2018 ). Specifically, to mouse brain DTI and tractography studies, there are some changes in the scalar metrics one year after fixation, but these changes are sufficiently small, particularly in WM to support reproducible connectomes over a period ranging from two weeks to one-year postfixation ( Xiao et al., 2020 ). Also, it is a well-recognized fact that formalin fixation alters water diffusion coefficients in the context of pathological conditions, such as the infarcted brain ( Sun et al., 2005 ) as well as in DTI preclinical studies with fresh ex vivo and fixed brains tissue ( DArceuil et al., 2007 ), which have to be accounted for in the ex vivo pipeline of high-quality images ( Dyrby et al., 2011 ) to improve the validation strategies for the interpretation of microstructure ( Dyrby et al., 2018 ). Particular to our ex vivo study, the chosen lower b-value (10 0 0 smm 2 ) for acquisition has been used in previous preclinical studies ( Crombe et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). However, it is also probable that this particular lower b value maynot be enough (in the case of the NODDI model) to completely distinguish the restricted diffusion for the intra-neurite compartment from other compartments, thus a lower initial b value might (a) Macrostructural biomarkers derived from MRI scans showed a significant reduction in volume across regions, particularly susceptible to the mHTT expression. Significant changes in whole brain volume and segmented ROIs can only be detected at the symptomatic stage. (b) Microstructural changes can be measured in specific regions of the R61 mouse neuroanatomy. In such regions, early changes in GM and WM neuronal microstructure can be analyzed by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In WM tracts (represented as axonal cross-sections in Fig. 11 d) and cortical GM, a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) can be associated with a neuronal injury. Neurodegenerative microstructural changes detected with the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model using the cell degeneration and neuronal mass intracellular compartment (IC) and the intracellular volume fraction (ICVF). (c) Glial cells like astrocytes and microglia have a major role in the regulation of the brain tissue microenvironment. (d) Astrocytes (by their regulation of the membrane Aquaporin receptor expression) regulate the hydric environment. Water balance mechanisms could be altered or enhanced in the early stages of HD. Thus, the combination of neurite volume decreases and a potential increase in water content could explain the expansion of the extracellular compartment (EC), increasing the overall mean diffusion (MD) within the voxel, as well as the orientation diffusion index (ODI). Also, microglial cells, (one of the main cells involved in inflammatory processes) increases their secretion of cytokine mediators, also augmenting the tissue water permeability from the brain-blood barrier (BBB) at later stages of the disease. The combination of all previously mentioned effects (decrease in the IC, increase in EC, and small vessel permeability) may lead to an early and local (interstitial) raise in free-water content, as detected by an increase in the levels of isotropic volume fraction (IsoVF).

Interestingly, that study showed the optimum parallel diffusivity is significantly lower for GM relative to WM, and a significantly decrease in optimum parallel diffusivity in GM  WM in the infant group. Moreover, in recent clinical studies, researchers have optimized the value of d for the cerebral cortex to 1.1  10 -3 mm 2 s (from the default value of 1.7  10 -3 mm 2 s) in the study of GM regions ( Fukutomi et al., 2019 ). Although our studies used an empirical diffusivity value equal for GM and WM brain structures, further studies are necessary to define specific GM diffusivity values in murine brain tissues.\nConceptual limitations of the dMRI models must always be considered due to the complexity of the biological materials under analysis. Different mechanisms can compensate for one another and lead to misinterpretations of the underlying events. As an example, immune cell infiltration, which results in a de-crease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ( Sevick et al., 1992 ), can be counteracted by the vasogenic edema induced by neuroinflammation ( Schlaug et al., 1997 ). Thus, the use of DTI derived parameters may not be specific enough to selectively quantify restricted diffusion in inflammatory tissues, where several interrelated cellular events are taking place simultaneously ( Glass et al., 2010 ;Komine and Yamanaka, 2015 ;Ransohoff et al., 2015 ;Sochocka et al., 2017 ). FA could potentially fall short in the GM assessment due to its isotropic nature and particularly important in the short distance exchange of information. Thus, it is possible that the collection of cell bodies and apical dendrites are not represented by most of the isotropic features ( Gatto, R. G. et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the use of more complex models as non-Gaussian diffusion models, can improve our quantitative approach and interpretation of the microstructural events in preclinical models of HD ( Gatto et al., 2015 ) and other NDDs ( Gatto, 2020a ;Gatto et al., 2019 ).\nEven though DWI methods might not be specific enough to reflect all the biological changes occurring in HD, these methods can be influenced by axonal pathology as well as changes in myelin content.Advanced DWI models appear to improve correlations with histology ( Albrecht et al., 2016 ). More and more aspects of neuroinflammation become accessible to probing by MRIMRS, and an increasing number of studies are carried out taking advantage of the complementarity of the information provided by this technique ( Quarantelli, 2015 ). The structural metrics obtained with these techniques are not direct measures of cell number or density and are likely to reflect a combination of many cellular processes. Nonetheless, these methods are sensitive to anatomical changes that can occur in the context of pathology such as atrophy, which has been linked to inflammation. MRI metrics are important for the characterization of neuroinflammatory disorders, and some have already proven their usefulness for diagnosis, and follow-up of patients affected by neuroinflammation ( Albrecht et al., 2016 ). Advanced diffusion models, based on neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in MRI, have proved to be sensitive to microglial density and the cellular changes associated with microglial activation in a preclinical setting ( Yi et al., 2019 ). Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, ( Miller, 2018 ) show changes in neuroinflammation, but evidence derived by MRI on astrocytic activation are still confined to few groups, and often on limited samples ( Cavaliere et al., 2020 ).\nOverall, UHFD-MRI is an exceptional tool to study structural neurodegenerative features in preclinical HD models ( Gatto et al., 2018a ) ( Weissmann et al., 2020 ) ( Fig. 12 ). However, the link between multiple macrostructural, microstructural, and neurochemical events are complex and still not well-understood. Thus, our approach encourages the combination of multiple dMRI models and analytical histological methods. This holistic approach could improve the timing of potential therapeutic approaches.",

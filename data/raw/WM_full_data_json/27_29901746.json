    "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the main risk factor for dementia. The subtle damage provoked by chronic high blood pressure in the brain is usually evidenced by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in terms of white matter (WM) hyperintensities or cerebral atrophy. However, it is clear that by the time brain damage is visible, it may be too late hampering neurodegeneration. Aim of this study was to characterize a signature of early brain damage induced by hypertension, before the neurodegenerative injury manifests.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "High blood pressure (BP) is a chronic condition that causes progressive target organ damage. 1,2 Decades of studies in hypertension allowed the identification of typical features of preclinical lesions in target organs of chronic increased BP, making available to clinicians clear markers of disease progression and complications in peripheral organs. However, high BP also profoundly challenges the brain. Besides contributing to acute forms of brain damage like ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertension is also the major risk factor for chronic brain injury, manifesting with alterations of cognitive functions, ranging from subtle deficits to dementia. 3,4 It is well known that the vast majority of cases of Alzheimers Disease and related dementia in elderly are not ascribable to genetic predisposition but rather to the chronic exposure to vascular risk factors in midlife. That is said, the clinical approach to this category of patients usually starts when symptoms are clearly evident and progression of dementia is perceived even by themselves. Indeed, the clinically relevant brain damage can be evidenced by conventional imaging, like structural MRI, which assesses the brain injury associated to the symptomatology and usually characterized as cerebral atrophy and white matter (WM) hyperintensities. 56789 However, it has becoming increasingly clear that when these macroscopic signs of brain damage are manifest, it may be too late to reverse the neurodegenerative process and we still lack procedures for assessing progression markers that could reveal pre-symptomatic alterations and identify patients at risk of developing dementia lately.\nA conceptual advancement that could help in overcoming these limitations, comes from novel neuroimaging approaches in MRI, capable to recognize alterations in the brain when conventional methods of analysis fail in detecting signs of damage. 10 To this aim, WM microstructural alterations began to be studied using DTI. 111213 The basic concept standing behind this approach exploits the water diffusion properties in WM and can reveal localized abnormalities in specific brain areas. The quantitative analysis of these diffusion properties let us calculate different indexes, which can describe the characteristics of integrity and organization of WM fiber bundles. The advantage over conventional methods stands on the possibility to identify damage at microscopic level instead of macroscopic lesions, making it possible staging damage progression.\nA main limitation in the use of this approach came from the evidence that the initial region of interest (ROI)-based or atlas-based methods of DTI analysis evidenced many technical flaws. More recently, the technological advancement allowed to overcome these limitations by developing methods to spatially characterize WM diffusion abnormalities along the pathway of a specific tract of WM instead of larger brain areas, and modelling appropriate diffusion schemes based on probabilistic assumptions 14 that produce a set of trajectories linked to a specific voxel. 14,15 Thus far, however, no study exploited this strategy to examine microstructural WM damage in hypertensive patients, at a stage where they have normal brain imaging at conventional MRI and no diagnosis of dementia at the neurocognitive assessment. The goal of our work was to identify a specific signature of subtle and early alterations in the brain of hypertensive patients, through the combined use of probabilistic fibertracking of WM and neuropsychological assessment.",

The protocol was performed in compliance with the ethical standards established in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of our Institution, as registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02310217). Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\nBetween November 2014 and September 2017, we screened subjects admitted at our outpatients facility-Regional Excellence Hypertension Center of the Italian Society of Hypertension-affiliated to the Department of Neurological Complications of Cardiovascular Diseases of our Institute. We recruited individuals conforming to the following criteria: aged 40 to 65 years, compliant to give written informed consent, possibility to perform a dedicated 3 Tesla-MRI scan. The resulting 143 eligible patients were subjected to the assessment of strict inclusionexclusion criteria by two independent raters. The exclusion criteria were the following: stroke, dementia, schizophrenia, seizures, Parkinsons disease, bipolar disorder, and any other diagnosed neurologic or psychiatric disease, claustrophobia, secondary hypertension, end-stage heart disease, renal failure, dialysis treatment, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and drugs that could affect cognitive functions. In the end, 70 patients met the criteria and entered the study. Then, in order to have a homogeneous sample of individuals, we further excluded subjects with already manifest signs of damage or alterations at conventional MRI andor diagnosis of dementia, assessed as detailed in the specific sections below. After this latter screening, 28 patients reporting WM hyperintensities or lacunar damage (n  19), neurinoma (n  1), meningioma (n  1), angioma (n  1), brain calcifications (n  2), and artefacts due to movement (n  4) were further excluded, resulting in a final sample of 42 individuals.\nEach subject included in the study protocol underwent clinical examinations to assess covariates as office BP, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and education, and were categorized in hypertensive (n  23) and normotensive (n  19) individuals accordingly to their history of hypertension, current anti-hypertensive therapy and target organ damage, determined as detailed below in specific sessions. Since the protocol was designed as an observational study, there was no unified antihypertensive schedule for hypertensives and actual anti-hypertensive therapy was recorded for all patients and included the following main classes of drugs: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE-IARBs), calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and b-blockers.",

After localization and calibration routines, the sequences used were as follows: T1-weighted images in axial orientation, acquired using a 3D SPGR sequence (TRTETI  5.61.7 400 ms, flip angle  11 , FOV  256 mm, slice thickness  1 mm, pixel spacing  1.0 mm Â 1.0 mm) with a 256 Â 256 in-plane resolution; AX DPT2 scan (TRTETE2  332010103.0 ms, FOV 220 mm, slice thickness  4 mm); DTI was performed with a diffusion weighted spin echoplanar imaging sequence (TRTE 89.712200 ms, slice thickness 3 mm, 50 contiguous slices, maximum b-value  1000 smm2 in 30 optimized noncollinear directions; one volume was acquired without diffusion weighting). All images were anonymized; radiological assessment was performed by a blinded radiologist; subsequent DTI and structural image analysis was performed by a blinded operator through an automated analysis protocol.\nConventional MRI on T1 and AX DPT2 scans were used to assess the presence of macroscopic brain damage, presence of WM hyperintensity load, lacunae, or other pathological alterations. A negative radiological result was considered an indispensable criterion to be eligible and the inclusion cut-off used for vascular-related damage was set at a Fazekas score  _ 1.\nDiffusion images were processed using the standardized pipeline with the DTIfit tool. After pre-processing, analysis was performed using the PROBTRACK tool of probabilistic Bayesian Framework for tractography. PROBTRACK exploits a diffusion model estimated by BEDPOSTX, a tool for probabilistic diffusion parameters estimation capable of modelling crossing fibers. A standard tractography pipeline has been implemented using the plugin AutoPTX, following parameters and quality check procedures as described. 16 17 segmented tract volumes were computed to exclude WM tract atrophies. FA, MD, AD, and RD were averaged for voxels inside tract segmentations. All tools were available from FSL Suite (version 5.0.8). 181920 The analysis of brain cortex assessed cortical thinning or atrophy (exclusion criteria for the study) and was performed with FSL-VBM (Voxel based morphometry), 21 an optimized VBM protocol 22 carried out with FSL tools. 18 First, structural images were brain-extracted and grey matter-segmented before being registered to the MNI152 standard space using non-linear registration. 23 Second, all native grey matter images were non-linearly registered to this study-specific template and modulated to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation. The modulated grey matter images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3 mm. Finally, voxelwise General Linear Model (GLM) was applied using permutation-based non-parametric testing, correcting for multiple comparisons across space with significance threshold of corrected P-value (P 0.05).",

All the HT patients arriving at our observation were already on anti-hypertensive therapy, as listed in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Estimated duration of hypertensive condition was also recorded, accordingly to anamnestic history of patients (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).\nAt echocardiography, HT displayed signatures of hypertrophic remodeling, evidenced by increased thickness of LV walls, LVMI 2.7 , and RWT (Table 1). Hypertensive patients showed a significant diastolic dysfunction, even though the preserved cardiac ejection fraction (EF) observed in HT was indicative of an adaptive remodeling without loss of contractility, thus excluding organ failure (Table 1). In measuring carotid arteries IMT, HT displayed a moderate wall thickening (Table 1), usually reflecting a status of chronic increased BP, 39 reaching the significance only for the left internal carotid artery. On the other hand, the absence of atherosclerotic plaques excluded obstructive diseases that could compromise cerebrovascular functioning. Lastly, we evaluated renal function and observed that patients with hypertension had no alterations in microalbuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Table 1).",

    "Fiber-tracking highlights a signature of WM microstructural alterations in hypertensive patients": {
      "text": "Accordingly to our inclusionexclusion criteria, all individuals recruited had no damage at conventional T2-MRI scans, assessed by a blinded neuroradiologist. We further ascertained absence of topical cortical thinning of the grey matter, which could negatively impact on cognitive function, independently of WM damage. To unravel this issue we performed VBM analysis on T1-scan that showed normal grey matter, with no significant cluster of differences between NT and HT individuals, with lowest Pvalue equal to 0.274 across the volume (Figure 1). Additionally, we checked whether the WM tracts segmented by fiber-tracking DTI-MRI had any difference in the size, by evaluating single tracts volumes. No difference between HT and NT emerged, meaning that no tract evidenced malformation or atrophy (see Supplementary material online, Table S2). When we assessed the diffusion parameters of FA, MD, AD, and RD of the WM tracts segmented by fiber-tracking DTI-MRI, we revealed significant differences between HT and NT patients in specific tracts (Figure 2 and Table 2). Concomitant FA and MD variations are usually considered for extrapolation of specific tracts alterations. In brief, lower FA indicates disorganized fascicles, affected by microstructural processes such as demyelination, axonal degradation, or gliosis. 13 MD, is a more sensitive measure even though less specific, and it results increased by pathological processes affecting neuronal membranes. 13 We observed a specific pattern of alterations in the WM fiber tracts of HT as compared to NT (Figure 2 and Table 2). In particular, HT showed a significant deterioration of WM connections in projection fibers of the Right Anterior Thalamic Radiation (r-ATR) (Figure 2A), association fibers of the Right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (r-SLF) (Figure 2B) and callosal fibers of the Forceps Minor (FMI) (Figure 2C).\nThus, over the whole WM tracts analysed (Figure 3A), HT patients displayed a significant decrease in FA and concomitant increase in MD in the above-described specific tracts (i.e. ATR, SLF, and FMI), resulting in the signature represented in Figure 3B. Interestingly, while concurrent alterations of FA and MD were displayed only by right WM bundles of the specific tracts, MD alone revealed a damage progressing in the contralateral side (Table 2). In addition, AD and RD DTI parameters were considered, to take into account the potential impact of different neural mechanisms on WM abnormalities. Conventionally, incremental variations in RD are associated with myelin breakdown, 13 whereas in AD describe secondary processes of axon degeneration. 13 Our data also and hypertensive (HT) subjects showing in a colour-code the regions of brain cortex where (B) NT differed from HT (blue scale for non-significant differences-red scale for significant differences) and where (C) HT differed from NT (green scale for non-significant differences-red scale for significant differences).

The difference in DTI parameters emerged in the univariate between HT and NT subjects was still significant in the ANCOVA, independently of age (see Supplementary material online, Table S3). To further exclude that other potentially influencing covariates could interfere with the effects of hypertension on DTI parameters, we also tested gender, smoke, and BMI by ANCOVA. None of these factors influenced the significant difference between HT and NT for the WM tracts reported in the univariate analysis (see Supplementary material online, Table S3). More important, when we tested the potential influence of some anti-hypertensive drugs on the observed effects, we did not find any significant interference for none of the medications used (see Supplementary material online, Table S4).",

Further analysis of specific cognitive subdomains tested by the MoCA revealed significantly impaired memory, executive functions, attention, and language domains (see Supplementary material online, Table S5).\nThe significantly worse score reported by HT patients in the verbal paired-associate learning revealed difficulties in retaining new information through working memory (Table 1). On the Stroop Test, HT did not perform as well as NT, thus indicating that hypertension negatively affects executive functions (Table 1).

    "WM microstructural alterations scale with cognitive impairment and target organ damage": {
      "text": "In the end, we generated correlation models among microstructural WM alterations, cardiac remodeling, hypertensive condition and cognitive profile. We found a significant positive correlation between MoCA scores and FA of the projection and association fibers (ATR and SLF) (Figure 3C andD). FA values of the same projection and association fibers negatively correlated with the estimated duration of hypertension (Figure 3E) as MoCA scores did (Figure 3F). It is interesting to notice that the sample of hypertensive patients (n  18), excluded because of already manifest neurological damage, had a significantly longer estimated duration of hypertension when compared to the group of included patients (mean  SD  9.61  5.57 vs. 6.13  3.73 years; P  0.05), thus suggesting that with disease advancement, brain damage progressively evolve toward an increasingly manifest injury. Further supporting this hypothesis, both the included and excluded patients had comparable blood pressure control (data not shown). Hence, in order to test whether the observed correlations between DTI parameters and cognitive scores was modulated by hypertensive condition, we also performed a partial correlation analyses controlling for SBP and years of hypertensive conditions. There were no significant influences of SBP levels and overall duration of hypertension in the correlation observed neither between MoCA and FA r-ATR SBP: df(39)  0.239, n  42, P  0.132; years of hypertension: df(39)  0.199, n  42, P  0.213 nor between MoCA and FA r-SLF SBP: df(39)  0.287, n  39, P  0.069; years of hypertension: df(39)  0.276, n  42, P  0.081.\nSince altered FMI may be involved in impaired processing speed tasks, 41 we tested the correlation between Stroop interference time, Stroop test errors and FMI-FA, finding a significant relationship suggestive of an impact of hypertension in inhibiting interfering stimuli, represented by the time performance (Figure 3G andH). Even the correlation observed between FA-FMI and Stroop Interference Time was controlled for the interaction with both SBP, duration of hypertension and age, given that this latter parameter emerged as influencing the deterioration of FA-FMI observed in HT. Interestingly, while there was a statistically significant negative partial correlation between Stroop Interference Time and FA-FMI while controlling for SBP df(39)  -0.321, n  39, P  0.040 no effect was observed for overall duration of hypertension df(39)  -0.282, n  42, P  0.074 or when controlling for age df(39)  -0.126, n  42, P  0.431. When controlling the correlation between Stroop test errors and FMI-FA for the same parameters it emerged a significant negative correlation when controlling for overall duration of hypertension df(39)  -0.312, n  42, P  0.047 while no effect were observed controlling for SBP df(39)  -0.300, n  39, P  0.057 or when controlling for age df(39)  -0.196, n  42, P  0.219.\nIn the end, the significant negative correlation observed between indexed LVMI and MoCA (Figure 3I) revealed parallel progression of early cognitive alterations and initial peripheral organ damage.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This is the first study that highlights how hypertensive patients present microstructural alterations of specific WM tracts, at a stage where no sign of macroscopic structural brain damage was evidenced by conventional methods. The WM abnormalities, displayed in tracts segmented by probabilistic fiber-tracking and associated to projectionassociation fibers and callosum system, were not visible on structural MRI and were associated with impairment of the related cognitive functions, typically prodromal of later dementia.\nOur results have been obtained in a hypertensive population characterized by the absence of comorbidities and an initial stage of peripheral organ damage, as shown by modest cardiac and vascular hypertrophic remodeling, but no overt sign of end-organ failure. The lack of structural brain injury induced by hypertension makes assessing prodromal signs quite challenging. DTI-MRI revealed itself as an important step toward using advanced neuroimaging as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. 11,12 WM links different functional brain areas through bundles of fibers established between different cortical structures or between subcortical areas and the cortex. The fiber bundles could be thus defined, following anatomical projections. Based on this a priori knowledge of the whole connections in the brain, we can track the WM bundles relating different functional areas and creating a unique tract identification for each subject. 16,42 By applying this method, we performed DTI-MRI tractography, probabilistically estimating fiber orientation and number per each voxel, and extracting quantitative diffusion parameters. 14,15 Despite HT subjects in our study were on anti-hypertensive therapy, the analysis evidenced a specific signature of their brains, characterized by a deterioration of projection fibers (ATR), association fibers (SLF), and callosum (FMI) systems. Interestingly, the injured tracts are related to specific cognitive functions that were concomitantly impaired, as envisaged by performance on cognitive assessment. The ATR is a projection fiber that connects the thalamuss anterior nucleus to the anterior cingulate gyrus and frontal cortex, and ATR damage has been linked to impaired memory, 43 as revealed also in our HT patients by poor performance on MoCA test, and specifically in the memory subscale. The SLF, a tract composed of two long bi-directional bundles of neuronal axons, connects the cerebrum parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes with the ipsilateral frontal cortices. 43 Characterized primarily as an association fiber, the SLF facilitates the formation of a bidirectional neural network necessary for cognitive functions such as attention, memory, emotions, and language, 43 functions as well impaired in HT under investigation in our study. Lastly, the FMI, also known as the anterior forceps, is a fiber bundle that connects the frontal lobes lateral and medial surfaces, crosses the midline via the genu of the corpus callosum, and has been linked to processing speed tasks. 41 This latter is some way measured by the results reported in the Stroop interference test, significantly worse in HT. Taken together, the altered WM tracts recapitulate a spatial signature of microstructural alterations that could be prodromal of the brain areas typically reported as affected by lacunar damage or hyperintensities in studies performed in patients at later stages of the disease and subjected to conventional MRI. Interestingly, this pattern of alteration has been extracted from a sample of patients with adequate range of blood pressure control, suggesting that an efficient anti-hypertensive therapy is not sufficient to exclude the onset of vascular dementia or protect the brain from WM microstructural damage. Further supporting this concept, the sample of patients that we excluded because of macroscopic WM damage evidenced by conventional MRI had a significantly longer estimated duration of hypertensive condition, despite showing ranges of blood pressure control similar to those of the samples of patients included in the study protocol.\nIn addition, it should be further considered that several other risk factors, typically associated with hypertension as well, as aging, increased BMI and smoking, may influence per se WM integrity. The results obtained in the covariate analyses conducted in subjects under investigation in this work, would suggest a negligible role of potential interactions established between hypertension and confounding factors, thus strengthening the relevance of the signature identified. Likely, the strict inclusionexclusion criteria chosen in this study allowed to study a population of HT as deprived as possible of confounding factors for the analysis of WM alterations.\nTo fully understand which kind of treatment can protect WM and cognitive functions, studies aimed at addressing the mechanisms generating the damage need to be carried on. On this notice, two recent works added important knowledge in this field of research, showing how salt intake can affect cerebral blood flow 44 and how pericyte loss can alter the",

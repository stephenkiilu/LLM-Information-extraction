    "abstract": "Background-Neuroimaging in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) generally shows medial temporal lobe atrophy and diminished glucose metabolism and cerebral blood flow in the posterior cingulate gyrus. However, it is unclear whether these abnormalities also impact the cingulum fibers, which connect the medial temporal lobe and the posterior cingulate regions. Objective-To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA), to test 1) if MCI and AD are associated with DTI abnormalities in the parahippocampal and posterior cingulate regions of the cingulum fibers; 2) if white matter abnormalities extend to the neocortical fiber connections in the corpus callosum (CC); 3) if DTI improves accuracy to separate AD and MCI from healthy aging vs structural MRI. Methods-DTI and structural MRI were preformed on 17 patients with AD, 17 with MCI, and 18 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Results-FA of the cingulum fibers was significantly reduced in MCI, and even more in AD. FA was also significantly reduced in the splenium of the CC in AD, but not in MCI. Adding DTI to hippocampal volume significantly improved the accuracy to separate MCI and AD from CN. Conclusion-Assessment of the cingulum fibers using diffusion tensor imaging may aid early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Structural MRI studies found prominent volume losses in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 1-3 and Alzheimer disease (AD) 4-6 while PET and SPECT studies found functional reductions primarily in the posterior cingulate. 7-12 The regional dissociation between structural and functional abnormalities may be due to reduced neuronal traffic between medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate. Thus the cingulum fibers which connect the medial temporal lobe and the posterior cingulate 13,14 may be involved in early AD. In late AD, as the disease spreads to the cortex, 15 neocortical connections, such as corpus callosum (CC), may also be afflicted.",

      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to detect degradation of white matter fiber bundles, 16-18 by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (D). 19 Several DTI studies of AD found abnormal FA and D in posterior cingulate, 20-22 temporal, parietal lobes, 23,24 and CC. 22,25-27 However, the regional patterns of abnormal DTI values were not consistent. Moreover, previous DTI assessments were limited to the posterior cingulate, while fiber extensions to medial temporal lobe were not evaluated. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of DTI for MCI and AD as compared to conventional hippocampal volumetry has not been determined.\nThe main goals of this study were 1) to test if abnormal DTI values along the cingulum fibers are associated with MCI and AD pathology; and 2) to test if DTI measures improve the accuracy to separate MCI and AD from healthy aging over hippocampal volume loss.",

Patients with AD and MCI were referred from the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) and Davis (UCD) AD treatment centers, and CN subjects were recruited from populations, between July 2002 and April 2005. All participants underwent a series of neurologic tests and a battery of neuropsychological assessments, which included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 28 and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) 29 at UCSF. MCI was determined according to either the Petersen criteria 30 or the criteria established by the AD Cooperative Study (ADCS). 31 Three of the MCI subjects were diagnosed with amnesic MCI, according to Petersen criteria, while the remaining MCI subjects presented a broader range of cognitive impairments. All patients with AD fulfilled the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stoke and AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria 32 for probable AD. The CN subjects had no history of a psychiatric or neuropsychological disease, major heart disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, or head trauma, and furthermore, scored within the normal range on all cognitive tests. A neuroradiologist reviewed the MR images from each subject to confirm absence of major neuropathologies, such as tumors and infarctions. Furthermore, subjects with extensive white matter lesions (WML) involving fibers of interest were not included in this study. In general, however, subjects with WML not extending into the regions of interest were included in this study. An experienced radiologist reviewed all T1, T2-weighted, and proton density images to determine severity of WML. In addition, the severity of WML was classified as mild (score 1), moderate (score 2), or severe (score 3), according to Scheltens rating scale. 33 All subjects or their legal guardians gave written informed consent before participation in the study, which was approved by the committees of Human Research at UCSF and the VA Medical Center.",

DTI was performed using an inversion-prepared double refocused single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence 34 (TRTETI  60001002000 msec; 2.34  2.34 in-plane resolution, 19 contiguous slices, each 5 mm thick), with bipolar diffusion sensitizing gradients of b  1000 smm 2 applied along six directions. Additional spin-echo EPI scans without diffusion gradients (b  0 image) were also acquired for normalizing diffusion measurements. Inversion recovery reduced contributions from CSF to the diffusion signal and double-refocusing RF pulses with bipolar gradients reduced geometric distortions in DTI due to eddy currents.",

Furthermore, hippocampal boundaries from semi-automated tracing were visually reviewed scan by scan and manually corrected if misregistrations occurred, thus further diminishing differences between manual and automated measurements.

DTIstudioV2 software 36 (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) was used to create FA, D, and color-coded directionality maps of diffusion, that were overlaid on each other. The color-coded directional maps (red: left-to-right direction, green: anterior-to-posterior direction, blue: superior-to-interior direction) provided easy visualization of the white matter fiber tracts. Elliptical regions of interest (ROI) were drawn based on the identification of white matter tracts on the color-coded maps. 21,25 A total of four pairs of ROIs were placed on axial slices to select the following white matter regions (figure 1): 1) bilateral parahippocampal regions on the medial temporal portion of the cingulum fibers at a slice level where the full view of the hippocampal formation could be identified; 2) bilateral posterior cingulate regions, at the middle level of the dorsal curve of the cingulum fibers; 3) genu and splenium ROIs at the center of anterior and posterior CC; 4) for reference, bilateral regions at the posterior limb of internal capsule, where sensorimotor fiber converge and no degradations related to MCI or AD are expected. FA and D values within each ROI were averaged. ROIs were placed to maximally encompass each white matter fiber tract, and had generally an in-plane size of 4  4 mm 2 to 6  9 mm 2 , with 5 mm slice thickness. The ROI sizes were kept fixed for all subjects. To account for potential variation of fiber thickness with head size, TIV was included as a covariate in the group analysis of DTI data. An experienced radiologist (Y.Z.), blinded to subject information including diagnosis, performed the ROI drawings. To determine reliability of the ROI measurements, the same rater repeated ROI drawings on 12 randomly selected subjects, blinded to the previous readings. Reliability, expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient, was 0.96 for the DTI measurements.",

A similar linear model was used to analyze variations of hippocampal volumes. To determine if diagnosis and age added explanatory power and were therefore needed in the models, three nested models were fitted by maximum likelihood: the first (base) model included only the covariates, while diagnosis and a diagnosis  age interaction were sequentially added in the second and third model, respectively. The resulting fits were compared sequentially via F-tests to determine if diagnosis or diagnosis  age added explanatory power (p  0.05) to the base model. To estimate the magnitude of group effects, effect sizes were calculated according to the following:\nwhere Mean 12 and Std 12 represent mean and SD, respectively, of measures in Groups 1 and 2, and n 12 are the number of subjects in Group 1 and 2. The powers of DTI and hippocampal volume measures to correctly classify CN, MCI, and AD were estimated based on logistic regressions and sensitivity and specificity of the classifications were expressed in terms of a receiver operator characteristics analysis as area under the curve (AUC). The logistic regressions were further adapted to a random leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation of the classifications. Finally, AUCs from cross-validations were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The statistical computations were performed using Splus 6.3 (Insightful Inc., Seattle, WA). The significance level was α  0.05 in all tests.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We found that 1) MCI is associated with FA reductions particularly in the cingulum fibers, predominantly in the left posterior cingulate. In AD, FA is further reduced in the cingulum fibers and FA reductions extend to the splenium, consistent with previous reports. 2) FA reductions in the posterior cingulate improved the classification of MCI and AD from cognitively normal elderly compared to the classifications using hippocampal volume loss alone.\nTo explain the dissociation between PETSPECT and MRI findings in MCI and AD, we hypothesized that the integrity of the cingulum fibers, which connect the posterior cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus, 13,14 may be compromised in the early stage of AD. Although the exact nature of the fiber disintegration is unclear, FA reduction, coupled with increased diffusivity, is thought to reflect axonal loss or demyelination. 37,38 Our finding of prominent FA reduction in posterior cingulate regions in MCI is consistent with previous reports, 21,22 and the substantial FA reductions in parahippocampal regions in MCI further establishes the vulnerability of the cingulum fibers in the early stage of AD. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that the entire connections between hippocampus and posterior cingulate are affected in the early stage of AD. Furthermore, we found that the FA values of the cingulum fibers in MCI are significantly lower than in controls but very close to the FA values in AD group, whereas the hippocampal volumes in MCI are intermediate between AD and control and in fact not significantly different from control. If we conceptualize MCI as representing early AD, our findings suggest that DTI measures of FA in the cingulum fibers may be a more sensitive marker of early AD pathology than hippocampal volume. Therefore, if these findings are replicated, DTI measures of FA in the cingulum fibers may be used as an early predictor of future cognitive decline and development of AD.\nConsistent with previous DTI studies in AD, we also found FA reductions in posterior aspects but not anterior aspects of the CC. 22,25 Anatomically, the posterior CC connects the temporal and parietal cortices, while the anterior CC connects frontal cortices. 39 Thus, our finding supports the suggestion that the temporoparietal connections are more impacted than frontal connections by AD.\nWe also found that FA reductions of cingulum fibers, especially in the left posterior cingulate region, improved the classification between MCI and elderly controls over using hippocampal volume alone. Hippocampal volume could not accomplish reliable classification between MCI and CN, independent of whether adjustments for age effects were made. Moreover, FA of the cingulum fibers significantly improved the separation of AD from control subjects, achieving almost complete separation between the groups, compared to an already high classification power using hippocampal volume alone. Taken together, the results suggest that measuring the FA value in the cingulum fibers could be a supplementary marker to the hippocampal volume in diagnoses of MCI and AD. Prospective studies are underway to determine if DTI predicts cognitive decline and conversion to AD.\nOur study has several limitations. Since we did not follow patients with MCI longitudinally to determine conversion to AD, it remains to be seen whether the DTI findings in MCI were related to AD or indicates perhaps other types of dementia. Another limitation is that DTI observations in AD and MCI could be related to other factors than the AD pathology, such as WML due to cerebral vascular disease, although the groups were matched by WML severity and the subjects with WML involving the ROI were not included in this study. The relation between fiber integrity and cerebral vascular disease needs to be further explored. Lastly, it cannot be excluded that inclusion of CSF, as a consequence of brain atrophy, may have biased DTI results in AD and MCI toward lower FA and higher D values, despite our attempts to suppress the CSF signal by using an inversion-recovery DTI sequence. Therefore, our DTI results may not entirely be decoupled from underlying brain atrophy and more work needs to be done to develop techniques that further reduce or eliminate this confound from DTI measurements.

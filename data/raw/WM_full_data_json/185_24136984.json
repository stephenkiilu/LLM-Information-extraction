    "abstract": "Background: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and Alzheimers disease (AD) have some similar clinical features and both involve white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disorders. Purpose: To compare putative relationships between ventricular morphology, CSF flow, and white matter diffusion in AD and NPH. Material and Methods: Thirty patients (18 with AD and 12 with suspected NPH) were included in the study. All patients underwent a 3-Tesla MRI scan, which included phase-contrast MRI of the aqueduct (to assess the aqueductal CSF stroke volume) and a DTI session (to calculate the fractional anisotropy FA and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC) in the internal capsules). Results: FA was correlated with ventricular volume in the suspected NPH population (P  0.001; r s ¼ 0.88), whereas the ADC was highly correlated with the aqueductal CSF stroke volume in AD (P  0.001; r s ¼ 0.79). Conclusion: Although AD and NPH both involve CSF disorders, the two diseases do not have the same impact on the internal capsules. The magnitude of the ADC is related to the aqueductal CSF stroke volume in AD, whereas FA is related to ventricular volume in NPH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the Western world. It involves grey matter and white matter abnormalities, both of which are correlated with indices of cognitive decline (1,2). In AD, ventriculomegaly, white matter lesions, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow disorders can be evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3).\nMoreover, recent theoretical work has suggested that certain CSF disorders could induce AD (4). Indeed, ventricular enlargement is a morphological sign of AD progression (5,6).\nHowever, these types of morphological and functional changes are not fully specific for AD, since patients with hydrocephalus present the same type of brain lesions (7). Many researchers have assessed the relationship between ventricular enlargement and the severity of AD (8) or hydrocephalus (7). Indeed, ventricular volume increases with disease severity and is associated (notably in hydrocephalus) with changes in parameters measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (9). Moreover, phase contrast MRI (PCMRI) enables the hydrodynamic assessment of biologic fluids. The aqueductal CSF stroke volume quantifies the volume of fluid passing from the ventricular compartment into the subarachnoid spaces and thus reflects the pressure differences experienced by the ventricular system (10). It has been shown that aqueductal CSF stroke volumes are higher in normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) than in AD (11). It is also well established that AD induces white matter lesions (notably in the internal capsule IC) that can be observed with DTI. However, the cause of this degeneration has yet to be defined (12). In DTI, tissue diffusion properties can be assessed by means of two postprocessed indexes: fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Fractional anisotropy reflects the spatial organization of the studied material (with an FA value of 0 indicating an isotropic medium and a value of 1 indicating a linear arrangement), whereas the ADC represents the magnitude of water diffusion. It has been suggested that when intracranial pressure increases, the water diffusion (i.e. the ADC) in the periventricular region will increase because of the transependymal resorption of CSF (13,14). This process produces an increase in the extracellular water content in adjacent tissues (e.g. interstitial edema). Increased diffusion in the periventricular region has been documented in selected clinical cases of NPH and in obstructive hydrocephalus (15). Even though the disease mechanisms in AD and NPH share certain features, the putative relationships between ventricular volume, CSF flow, and diffusion values in periventricular structures (such as the ICs) in AD have not previously been investigated. Here, we examined the links between morphological aspects of lateral ventricles (e.g. volume) and aqueductal CSF stroke volume with diffusion parameters in the ICs in patients with AD and suspected NPH patients.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The aim of the present study was to assess the potential relationships between CSF hydrodynamics, ventricle morphology, and white matter characteristics in the periventricular area in AD patients and in suspected NPH patients. First, we found that suspected NPH patients had a higher aqueductal CSF stroke volume and a greater ventricular volume than AD patients did. This was consistent with the literature data on this topic (11,24). A few researchers have assessed DTI parameters in periventricular structures in AD or hydrocephalus. Assaf et al. (25) examined patients with increased intracranial pressure (not chronic idiopathic hydrocephalus) and reported abnormally high FA in white matter regions in the vicinity of the ventricles. Hattingen et al. studied patients with idiopathic hydrocephalus and found similar results for the corticospinal tract (9). However, these studies compared diseased patients with healthy elderly controls. In the present work, we compared DTI results for two diseases in which similar types of brain lesions occur (7). We did not observe intergroup differences in FA in the ICs.\nWe observed significant differences between AD and suspected NPH in terms of white matter characteristics. Indeed, we found that the shape of the diffusion tensor was not affected by ventricular enlargement in AD but was significantly correlated with the latter parameter in NPH (Fig. 3). Our bootstrap analysis showed that this correlation was stable. We hypothesize that the changes in FA might be related to dilatation of the ventricles and associated damage to adjacent white matter (25,26). However, dilatation alone cannot explain the strong correlation between FA and ventricle size in suspected NPH, since this relationship was not observed in AD patients. Hence, another parameter must be involved in this phenomenon. We also found that the cm²s) Fig. 4. A scatter plot showing the relationship between the (ADC) and aqueductal CSF stroke volume at the internal capsule level for Alzheimer disease and suspected NPH. A Spearmans test revealed significant correlation between these two parameters for Alzheimer patients (P  0.001; r s ¼ 0.72).\nADC was found significantly correlated with aqueductal CSF stroke volume in AD patients (Fig. 4). Once again, internal validation of the model showed that this correlation was stable. This relationship can be explained by the forced-diffusion phenomenon: the higher the stroke volume, the higher the diffusion amplitude (notably via transependymal absorption). By way of an example, Fig. 7 presents axial T2-FLAIR images of the AD patients presenting the two most extreme stroke volumes. Transependymal resorption is clearly higher in Fig. 7b and was associated with the highest stroke volume in the AD group. However, it appears that the effect of convection is limited in range. Indeed, we found that this relationship did not hold for the suspected NPH patients, who had the highest aqueductal CSF stroke volumes. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that white matter damage is related to CSF pulsatility as well as ventricle size. Indeed, the CSF impacts on the ventricular walls at each cardiac cycle; when the aqueductal CSF stroke volume is high, this may enlarge the ventricles and lead to potential periventricular damage. Small stroke volumes and ventricular volumes do not affect the shape and size of the IC. However, ventricular enlargement is limited, since the brain is contained within the (non-expandable) skull. Once the enlargement limit has been reached, pressure on surrounding structures will rise and thus increase the likelihood of damage to white matter.\nIt is noteworthy that two patients with clinical features of NPH did not have the aqueductal CSF stroke volumes typically encountered in this condition (27). However, our study of flow measurement variability evidenced high reproducibility and so this finding cannot be attributed to errors in the CSF flow calculation. In fact, these data fit with the hypothesis whereby hydrocephalus can be concomitant with other degenerative diseases (such as AD or brain atrophy) (4). The typical aqueductal CSF stroke volume in healthy cm²s) Fig. 6. A scatter plot showing the relationship between apparent radial diffusivity and aqueductal CSF stroke volume for patients with AD and patients with suspected NPH. A Spearmans test revealed a significant correlation between these two parameters in the AD group (P ¼ 0.0015, r s ¼ 0.69).\nelderly subjects has been estimated at 34 mLcardiac cycle (28). The values for our AD patients were slightly higher than this, whereas NPH patients had significantly and abnormally high aqueductal CSF stroke volumes (which are in line with previous reports) (11).\nIn the present study, we used an ROI-based approach to investigate the changes in FA and ADC. Although the ROI method is easy to perform and readily available to most clinicians, it may be biased by subjectivity. A common alternative is the use of fully automated, voxelwise approaches such as TBSS (29). However, the TBSS method is reportedly not applicable to subjects with large ventricles (29,30). However, Hattingen et al. cross-validated their data using both ROI-based and TBSS approaches and found similar results (9). Thus, our choice of an ROI-based analysis remains valid. Despite the fact that the ventricular dilatation observed in hydrocephalus patients can affect the aspect of white matter on the FA map, we were able to adequately visualize the ICs and designate our ROIs (Fig. 1).\nAnother potential study limitation relates to patient selection. Our AD and suspected NPH patients were selected according to clinical criteria (notably cognitive function screening for AD and Hakims triad evaluation for NPH). In both diseases, it is difficult to establish accurate diagnostic criteria. Moreover, we did not perform follow-up studies of our patients (notably for suspected NPH) and thus cannot completely rule out the possibility that factors other than hydrocephalus contributed to the clinical symptoms in some of the suspected NPH patients. However, none of the NPH patients had a diagnosed medical condition that better explained the key symptoms than idiopathic hydrocephalus did.\nIn conclusion, our study showed that although both AD and NPH involve CSF disorders, the two diseases do not have the same impact on the ICs. We found that the magnitude of the diffusion is related to the aqueductal CSF stroke volume in AD, whereas the FA is related to ventricular volume in NPH.",

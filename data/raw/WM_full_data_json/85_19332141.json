    "abstract": "Although Huntingtons disease is largely considered to be a subcortical disease, there is no clear consensus on whether all deep grey matter loss is a direct downstream consequence of the massive degeneration of the medium-size spiny neurons in the striatum. Our aim was to characterise in vivo such preferential degeneration by analysing various distinct diffusion imaging measures including mean diffusivity, anisotropy, fibre orientation (using the information of the principal diffusion direction) and white matter tractography. All results converged to demonstrate the selective degeneration of connections in subcortical grey and white matter, degeneration which was likely to originate with the death of the striatal medium-size spiny neurons. Indeed, we found a significant increase of MD and FA in all the subcortical grey matter structures involved in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. The atypical striatal and pallidal increase of FA was concurrent to a decrease of the dispersion of the fibre orientation, unambiguously characterising a preferential loss of connections along specific radiating directions from these structures while some others are comparatively spared. Analysis of striatal and pallidal white matter tracts revealed that striato-pallidal projections were the most affected. The ability of DTI to uncover the impact of such neurodegenerative disease on some specific neuronalaxonal populations is a further step towards the future definition of a surrogate marker of this disease. Beyond Huntingtons disease, we prove here that diffusion imaging technique, associated to adequate methodological analyses, can provide insight into any neurodegenerative disorder for which some neuronal populations or connections are selectively targeted over others.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a lethal autosomic dominant neurodegenerative disease that predominantly affects subcortical grey matter structures. Post mortem, it is characterised at the cellular level by the progressive degeneration of the striatal medium-size spiny neurons, which represent the great majority of the neuronal populations of the striatum (Graveland et al., 1985;Vonsattel et al., 1985). In vivo, the subcortical impact of HD is macroscopically depicted by the atrophy of the striatum, the pallidum and the thalamus-referred to hereafter as the subcortical grey nuclei or SGN-but also of the substantia nigra as measured by conventional structural MRI (Jernigan et al., 1991;Aylward et al., 2004;Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Douaud et al., 2006).\nIt remains unclear whether all deep grey matter loss can be attributed to the original death of striatal spiny neurons. The primary degeneration in the striatum may spread to the other subcortical nuclei composing the basal ganglia loops via the preferential loss of striatopallidal projections. Being able to characterise such preferential degeneration in basal ganglia connections would be crucial to determine whether protecting or replacing striatal cells would be enough to prevent extrastriatal cell loss (Bachoud-Levi et al., 2000;McBride et al., 2006). Nevertheless, this question has never been addressed in vivo before and, contrary to post mortem investigations, would benefit from access to data at an early stage of the disease, permit a whole-brain exploration of the pathophysiological process and offer a unique way to monitor its progression and the effect of experimental treatments. However, this is not a question that can be answered by conventional imaging techniques. Indeed, these techniques are unable to distinguish regional brain atrophy that is general or non-specific in its cellular targets from atrophy that affects specific cell populations.\nOn the contrary, we hypothesised that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) would have the potential to make such a distinction in cases where the connections of different populations of neurons have different orientational organization. First, mean diffusivity (MD) tends to be increased in pathological tissue-grey or white matter-where the density of cellular membranes is reduced. In tissue that is preferentially organized along a particular orientation, such as along axonal fibres, fractional anisotropy (FA) is commonly found to be decreased in case of a pathological process as a result of the reduction in cellular boundaries that hinder diffusion (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996;Beaulieu, 2002). No systematic effect is observed on the main orientation of the underlying tissue, represented in practice by the orientation of the first eigenvector of the tensor (also called principal diffusion direction or PDD). However in deep grey matter, where there are multiple populations of cells and connections with different orientational preferences, a selective degeneration of some of these connections would make this tissue appear less isotropic, which corresponds to an atypical increase of FA. Subsequently, this preferential degeneration would also be characterised by a better coherence of these multiple orientations within these structures, i.e. by a decrease in the spatial dispersion of the PDD. A systematic shift of orientation of the PDD away from the more vulnerable connections should also be seen (Pierpaoli et al., 2001).\nIn HD, if the loss of subcortical grey matter originates from the death of medium-size spiny neurons in the striatum, then one organized population of neurons and axons should be comparatively more affected than the others. We thus would expect to see an increase in MD in deep grey matter structures as a marker of degeneration, accompanied by an increase in FA as evidence for the selectivity of this degeneration. Concurrently, fibre orientations should be spatially distributed more homogeneously, i.e. we should be able to show a decrease in their dispersion. In the putamen for instance, where connections to the pallidum (medio-lateral orientation) should degenerate more rapidly than the cortico-subcortical projections (dorsoventral direction), we should be able to demonstrate a systematic change in fibre orientation towards this superiorinferior axis. Some selectivity in the degeneration of subcortical white matter tracts would also be expected. That is, for each subcortical structure, its connections (reconstructed using tractography) that would be directly affected by the initial death of striatal spiny neurons should be found more abnormal than the others.\nHD therefore here serves as an exceptional pathological model to assess whether DTI technique combined to a specific methodology will be able to demonstrate a selective degeneration. This would clearly be of benefit for a better understanding and monitoring of other neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in which an increase of FA in the basal ganglia was first witnessed (Ciccarelli et al., 2001).",

All subjects gave their written informed consent. Subjects 14 HD patients (5 women, 9 men, aged 42  8) were included in this study. All patients had a genetically proven HD with an abnormal number of CAG repeats ranging from 41 to 57 and at least 1 year of clinical symptoms. At the time of the imaging study, the majority of the patients (n  9) were at stage I of the disease (total functional capacity or TFC  11-13; Shoulson and Fahn, 1979). Four of the patients were at stage II (TFC  10) and one was at stage III (TFC  6). 10 control subjects (5 women, 5 men, aged 37  12) underwent the same imaging protocol. We did not try to match patient and control populations for age. Indeed, we expected a differential impact of age on our DTI measures in the two groups which we controlled for statistically (see the Statistical analysis section below). Finally, HD patients were examined using the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) (1996) in each hospital and the scores for each subscale (motor, behavioural, functional and neuropsychological) were collected.",

      "text": "Diffusion-weighted images of patients and controls were preprocessed in BrainVISA (Cointepas et al., 2001), which corrects for the echoplanar distortion (Mangin et al., 2002) and automatically extracts the diffusion tensor in each voxel.\nIn order to be confident in our findings, we carried out two independent analyses of the diffusion images. We first performed wholebrain voxel-wise analyses, which requires no a priori hypotheses regarding the location of the changes. These allowed us to discern whether the effects were specific to the deep grey matter structures. We then manually defined anatomical regions of interest (ROI) of the subcortical grey matter on a subject-by-subject basis, to ensure that any effect seen in the voxel-wise analyses could not be explained by a residual misregistration of the patient data to the standard space.\nPreprocessing of FA, MD and x, y and z components of the PDD images for the voxel-wise analyses Special care was given to the voxel-wise approach employed to register all MD and FA maps into a common standard space. Such an approach is delicate in Huntingtons disease and the registration step may not correctly handle the massive atrophy of the deep grey nuclei, leading to a misinterpretation of the results (Douaud et al., 2006).\nIn a preliminary analysis using the SPM2 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London), we found that the use of a template built from the b 0 images did not give a satisfactory realignment of the subcortical structures, probably due to the lack of contrast in these structures in such maps. Similarly, the use of a template of grey matter, constructed with the corresponding grey matter segmented T1-weighted images, happened to be insufficient to properly realign the subcortical structures. Indeed, diffusion-weighted images exhibit distortions due to susceptibility artefacts that are not present in T1-weighted images and are, unfortunately, mainly located around the deep grey matter (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995; see Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material).\nWe therefore created a left-right symmetric study-specific FA template, in which the subcortical contrast is excellent, particularly in the anterior limb of the internal capsule that is crucial for properly realigning the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This FA template was built from the 10 control subjects and a subset of 10 patients (5 randomly chosen stage I patients, the 4 stage II patients and the patient at stage III). This discards the bias that would have resulted from favouring one of the two groups in the spatial normalisation step. To create this template, all the b 0 images, as well as their respective mirror images, were first realigned onto the ICBM 152 T2 template (MNI), which was masked to extract only brain information. Then, the non-linear parameters estimated from these registrations were applied to each native FA map and its mirror image. A mean image of the 20 FA normalised images and their 20 corresponding mirror images was created and then convolved with an isotropic 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. All native FA maps were then non-linearly normalised onto this FA template and smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel (as the FWHM should be similar to the spatial extent of patient-control differences that are expected to be the strongest in the basal ganglia; Jones et al., 2005). The resulting non-linear transformations were applied to the MD maps (in which we removed the non-informative CSF signal) and to the maps of x, y and z projections of the first eigenvector of the diffusion tensor (PDD) in each voxel. Spatially normalised MD images as well as spatially normalised x, y and z maps of the PDD were then smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.",

The striatum was further subdivided into the head and body of the caudate nucleus, the anterior and posterior putamen, and the ventral striatum. In order to do reliable identification of these anatomical ROIs, a single examiner (GD) segmented these deep brain nuclei in the T1-weighted images which were rigidly reoriented so that the anterior and posterior commissures were located in the same axial plane and the inter-hemispheric plane was perpendicular to this axial plane (the AC-PC space, the MNI152 space with no scaling factor; see Douaud et al., 2006 for more details on the delineation of the structures) (Fig. 1).\nAll diffusion-weighted images, including the PDD maps, were similarly reoriented in the AC-PC space with a rigid spatial transformation (the gradients directions were reoriented using the same transformation prior to the estimation of the tensor). To obtain MD and FA subcortical values in these various subregions, the ROI were then placed on MD and FA scans rigidly reoriented in each subject own AC-PC space, after being eroded by 1 mm to limit partial volume effects in diffusion index values. Finally, to correct for the subcortical distortions that can be more prominent in some subjects than others (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995), a translation was manually applied on a structure-by-structure and subject-by-subject basis, when some of the ROI were still not properly superimposed to the corresponding structure in the diffusion space.",

This method determines the most probable direction to progress from one voxel to another by taking into account both the incident direction of the particle that reconstructs the virtual fibre and the principal diffusion direction derived from the tensor model. By attributing a weight to the incident direction of the particle that is larger in less anisotropic tissue, this tractography approach avoids a particle from being attracted to an improbable direction when it reaches a region of crossing fibres, such as the descending pathways from the sensorimotor cortex and the corpus callosum.\nThe virtual fibre tracts reconstructed for each subject were then fragmented and re-labeled: for instance, for two ROI A and B used as seed masks, we differentiated tracts joining ROI A and B from tracts going to or starting from ROI A and not joining ROI B and vice-versa (see Fig. S2 of the Supplementary material). For each SGN, it further follows from our hypotheses that the pathways directly affected by the death of medium-size spiny neurons of the striatum (striatum- pallidum) should demonstrate greater abnormalities than any other, comparatively more spared, known connections of this SGN (cortexstriatum, striatum-substantia nigra, thalamus-striatum; see Table S1 of the Supplementary material for details of these connections).",

      "text": "Whole-brain and ROI investigation of MD and FA: a first step towards the evidence of selective degeneration in the SGN We found a significant increase in MD in the HD patients primarily located in the subcortical grey matter. More precisely, higher MD values were found bilaterally in the anterior and posterior putamen, the pallidum, the ventral striatum and the thalamus (centro-median nucleus and right ventro-lateral nucleus) (Fig. 2). Additional increase of MD was found in the corona radiata, more precisely in the frontal and parietal white matter, mainly around the central sulcus. All the 3 and 4 of the Supplementary material).\nsignificant results found in the statistical ANCOVA t-map are listed in Table S2 of the Supplementary material.\nWe also found significantly higher FA values in the HD patients almost exclusively confined to the subcortical grey matter, particularly bilaterally in the putamen, the pallidum, the ventral striatum, the thalamus (ventro-lateral nucleus and centro-median nucleus), the substantia nigra and in the right subthalamic nucleus (Fig. 2; Table S3 of the Supplementary material).\nWe did not find any increase in MD or FA in the caudate nucleus. On close examination, it appeared that the nonlinear registration, though grossly matching the caudate nucleus across subjects, was not accurate enough to provide good correspondence of its whole contour. In order to verify these voxel-based findings in the subcortical structures and to test our hypothesis of an increase of MD and FA in the caudate, we then carried out an analysis, insensitive to registration issues, with the manually defined anatomical ROI.\nThe ROI placed on each individual MD map revealed a bilateral increase in MD values in every SGN including the caudate nucleus, anincrease that was significant except for in the left thalamus (Fig. 2; Table 1). MD was higher by  19 on average in the caudate of the patients,  34 in the putamen, 23 in the ventral striatum and 17 in the pallidum.\nFA values were found to be significantly higher in the head and body of the caudate, in the anterior putamen, the pallidum and the right thalamus. More precisely, FA values were increased by 27 in the caudate,  17 in the anterior putamen, 18 in the pallidum and were also increased by  11 in the posterior putamen and  6 in the thalamus (Fig. 2; Table 2).\nAnalysis of the fibre orientations in the SGN: further in vivo evidence to support selective degeneration in the SGN Using the anatomical ROI defined in the SGN, we carried out an analysis of the dispersion of the main fibre orientations (PDD) in each structure (Schwartzman et al., 2005).\nThis analysis revealed a significant decrease in dispersion in the head and body of the caudate, the anterior putamen, the pallidum and the thalamus compared to the control group (Fig. 3). More specifically, the dispersion was on average reduced in the patients by -15 in the caudate, -17 in the putamen, -5 in the ventral striatum, -17 in the pallidum and by -21 in the thalamus.\nA whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a significant bilateral reduction in the x component of the PDD in the patients, exclusively confined to the anterior and posterior putamen and to the pallidum (Fig. 3).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Although HD is mainly considered to be a subcortical disease, there is no clear consensus on whether all the deep grey matter loss is directly related to the original death of the medium-size spiny neurons of the striatum. It is essential to be capable of characterising in vivo such preferential degeneration as it would give a better insight into the evolving process of this neurodegenerative disease. To question this matter, we have used several distinct diffusion imaging measures, some of them being applied for the very first time to patients with neurodegenerative pathology. Complementary voxel-wise and ROI approaches were carried out, to ensure that the results obtained were not possibly driven by some residual misregistration when warping the diffusion images into a common standard space. All results-measures of MD, FA, PDD dispersion and white matter tractography-converged to demonstrate the selective degeneration of connections in the subcortical grey nuclei, degeneration that is likely to originate with the death of the striatal spiny neurons.\nIncreases in MD have often already been reported in previous studies on age-or disease-related neurodegeneration (Moseley, 2002;Bozzali and Cherubini, 2007). In line with our findings, two previous Adjusted mean MD values (SE) of Huntingtons disease patients and controls (10 -9 m 2 .s -1 ) and ANCOVA results between the two populations. Adjusted mean FA values (SE) between Huntingtons disease patients and controls and ANCOVA results. DTI studies using ROI analyses have shown higher MD values in the caudate and the putamen of HD patients (Mascalchi et al., 2004;Seppi et al., 2006), whilst one study only found it in the putamen (Rosas et al., 2006). More precisely, one of the studies showed an increase of 24 in the caudate and of  36 in the putamen which is in good agreement with our results in the neostriatum (19 and 34 respectively) (Mascalchi et al., 2004). The increase found in this study is slightly greater than the one we established probably because it was observed in patients at more advanced stages of the disease than the ones included in our study. This striatal MD increase is likely to be caused by the expansion of the extracellular space corresponding to a decrease in membrane density due to cell degeneration, which is in accordance with the volume loss in each sub-region of the striatum previously observed in these patients (Douaud et al., 2006). The higher MD values observed in the pallidum confirmed the results of two recent studies (Seppi et al., 2006;Rosas et al., 2006). This increase may either be imputable to the sole loss of the projections from striatal spiny neurons, or to neuronal shrinking or depletion within the pallidum itself (Wakai et al., 1993).\nFurthermore, we have found that FA values were increased in the caudate, the putamen and the pallidum. Two studies have reported an increased anisotropy in the lenticular nucleus but did not find any significant FA differences in the caudate, which should logically present a similar pattern to that observed in the putamen (Rosas et al., 2006;Kloppel et al., 2008). In contrast with the MD findings, the increased FA found in the deep grey matter is an unusual result. To our knowledge, there are only four studies showing such a result: one in multiple sclerosis (Ciccarelli et al., 2001), one in ageing (Furutani et al., 2005) and two in HD (Rosas et al., 2006;Kloppel et al., 2008). By the admission of the authors of the most recent study (Kloppel et al., 2008), the FA increases (found) in grey matter are difficult to interpret. In this study, we suggested that the selective loss of some of the subcortical connections targeted by the degenerative process-i.e., mainly the striato-pallidal projections at this early stage of the disease (Reiner et al., 1988;Albin et al., 1992;Mitchell et al., 1999;Deng et al., 2004)-may turn the striatum into a seemingly more organized structure.\nWe were able to test this hypothesis using a novel approach, never applied so far to clinical studies, which aims at examining the DTI data differently by studying the main fibre orientation depicted by the principal diffusion direction (Schwartzman et al., 2005). This ROI analysis revealed that the dispersion of the PDD was reduced in the neostriatum and the pallidum of the patients, unambiguously characterising a preferential loss of connections along specific radiating directions from these structures while some others were comparatively spared. PDD dispersion in the putamen also happened to provide the highest sensitivity for correctly diagnosing patients (93), compared with MD in the putamen (86) or FA in the caudate nucleus (71). As a corollary, we also more specifically interrogated our hypothesis by looking at the x, y and z components of the main fibre orientations. In the HD population, we predicted a very focal shift in the PDD away from the medio-lateral orientation (x-axis) of the putamino-pallidal connections towards the antero-posterior (y-axis) and the dorsal-ventral (z-axis) orientations of the cortical-putaminal projections (Parent and Parent, 2006). However, we could not make any assumptions about the organization of the fibres inside the caudate nucleus as the cortico-striatal projections to this structure have a less distinct organization compared with the striato-pallidal pathways. And indeed as predicted, a whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a decrease in the x component concurrent with an increase in the y and z components in the lenticular nucleus and only in this structure. This reflects the fact that the cortico-putaminal connections are relatively spared by the degenerative process at this stage of the disease compared to the putamino-pallidal pathways. This result can be compared to a similar ROI-based finding in Wallerian degeneration by Pierpaoli et al., who found a significant decrease of the PDD along the z axis characterising damages to the descending motor pathways in the rostral pons concurrent to an increase of the PDD along the x axis, showing that the transverse pontine fibres became the dominant pathway in this region (Pierpaoli et al., 2001).\nIn the white matter itself, the hypothesis of a preferential loss of some of the striatal connections was further supported by our tractography results, which precisely showed a significant increase in MD in the striato-pallidal projections. The biggest effect was found in the projection from the putamen to the pallidum (23 on average), while the other connections of the putamen (with the substantia nigra and the cortex) and the pallidum (with the thalamus and the subthalamic nucleus) showed a more moderate increase in mean diffusivity (9). Outside the subcortico-subcortical connections, the most significant effect was found in the cortical afferents to the putamen, remarkably coinciding with the white matter abnormalities located around the central sulcus revealed with the voxel-wise analysis of MD (see Fig. 5 for example in one subject). These MD differences in the corticostriatal pathways are in line with previous imaging and post mortem reports in both HD patients and animal model showing loss in the cerebral white matter and degeneration of the pyramidal cells the primary motor cortex (MacDonald and Halliday, 2002;Rosas et al., 2003;Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Cepeda et al., 2007). We further wanted to test if this modification of the mean diffusivity in the cortico-striatal projections was related to a possible loss of white matter quantifiable with a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) white matter analysis. We therefore performed the optimised white matter VBM protocol (Good et al., 2001) that showed a loss of deep white matter localised exclusively around the basal ganglia (see comments and Fig. S5 of the Supplementary material). It did not reveal any loss in the corona radiata after correction for multiple comparisons. This emphasizes that the MD index is sensitive to microstructural alterations of fibre bundles between the sensori-motor, premotor and prefrontal cortices and the striatum, before this micro-structural change develops into macrostructural loss measurable by VBM analyses.\nVoxel-based DTI analyses, which require no prior knowledge of the location of diffusion abnormalities, also allowed us to identify the thalamic nuclei targeted by the degenerative process and to reveal other subcortical microstructural alterations in the substantia nigra and the right subthalamic nucleus. Indeed, we found significantly higher MD and FA values in the ventro-lateral and the centro-median nuclei of the patients. Thalamic atrophy previously reported in these patients may therefore be confined to these two nuclei, which could explain the moderate volume loss in this subcortical structure (-16) (Douaud et al., 2006). As both ventro-lateral and centro-median nuclei are part of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop, these microstructural alteration and atrophy are most likely related to primary striatal injury (Parent and DeBellefeuille, 1983;Sidibe et al., 1997;McFarland and Haber;2002;Behrens et al., 2003). We also found a significant FA increase in the substantia nigra that may be driven by a selective deficit of striatal afferents and is in good agreement with the atrophy found previously in this structure (Douaud et al., 2006). Finally, while conventional T1-weighted MRI analyses have so far failed to reveal any alteration of the subthalamic nucleus, we were finally able to demonstrate an FA increase in this structure that completes the cortico-subcortico-cortical circuitry (Hamani et al., 2004).\nWhat have we learnt in vivo about the subcortical pathophysiological impact of HD?\nThe combined analyses of various DTI indices in HD therefore converge to provide meaningful information about the pathophysiological damage occurring in the subcortical regions of the brain. Interestingly, all subcortical grey matter structures involved in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops show microstructural abnormalities: the striatum, the pallidum, the ventro-lateral and the centromedian nuclei of the thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus and finally the substantia nigra. The only point of convergence of these loops being the striatum, it therefore seems probable that these abnormalities have as common origin the dramatic loss of striatal mediumsize spiny neurons. All the subcortical white matter connections implicated in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry also show an increase in MD, reinforcing the assumption of a primary degeneration in the striatum.\nFurthermore, voxel-based analysis of MD is able to reveal microstructural abnormalities in the white matter proximal to premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices, likely representing cortical projections to the posterior putamen. As the centro-median thalamic nucleus, sending back its efferents to the sensorimotor territories of the striatum and to the motor and premotor cortical areas, is predominantly involved in the motor basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop (Alexander et al., 1990;Parent and Parent, 2005), this altogether suggests that the motor subcortical loop is the most affected by the degenerative process at this stage of the disease.\nA crucial finding of this study is the in vivo characterisation of a selective degeneration of fibre tracts in subcortical regions. In the white matter, it is characterised by a massive increase in the mean diffusivity of the striato-pallidal connections (even more particularly between the putamen and the pallidum), an increase that was substantially bigger than for other striatal and pallidal connections. In the grey matter, this preferential loss of some fibre tracts is characterised by an increase in anisotropy. To find such an increase in a pathological study is a singular result. By analysing the dispersion of the fibre orientations in the subcortical grey nuclei, we have been able to demonstrate that this increase was related to a selective degeneration that had only been demonstrated post mortem so far (Reiner et al., 1988;Albin et al., 1992;Mitchell et al., 1999;Deng et al., 2004). This result is unprecedented and provides a solid answer to the few studies that found increased anisotropy in subcortical grey matter (Ciccarelli et al., 2001;Furutani et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2006;Kloppel et al., 2008). Above all, it offers the exciting perspective of being able to study in vivo the selective impact of HD in large population of patients and to follow the progressive degeneration in the subcortical structures and their connections, progression that post mortem studies do not permit by definition. The ability of DTI to uncover this preferential impact of the disease on some neuronal and axonal populations may represent in the future a precious surrogate marker to assess and monitor the impact of experimental therapies such as cell transplantation or neuroprotective gene therapy (Bachoud-Levi et al., 2000;McBride et al., 2006).\nFinally, the techniques we have outlined in this manuscript are not limited in their scope to HD. They can as such provide significant insight into any neurodegenerative disorder for which some neuronal populations or connections are selectively targeted over others including multiple sclerosis (Ciccarelli et al., 2001), Parkinsons disease (Yoshikawa et al., 2004) or Alzheimers disease (Ringman et al., 2007).",

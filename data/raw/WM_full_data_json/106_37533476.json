    "abstract": "Background: Vascular calcifications are a hallmark of atherosclerosis, and in the coronary arteries are routinely used as a prognostic marker. Calcifications of intracranial vessels (ICC) are frequently observed on non-contrast CT (NCCT) and their effect on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains unclear. Our aim was to explore the association of ICC with prospective long-term cognitive function and advanced MRI-measures in a large prospective cohort of cognitively intact mild stroke survivors. Methods: Data from the Tel-Aviv brain acute stroke cohort (TABASCO) study ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01926691 were analyzed. This prospective cohort study (n  575) aimed to identify predictors of PSCI, in cognitively intact mild stroke survivors. A quantitative assessment of the intracranial calcium content -The ICC score (ICCS) was calculated semi-automatically on NCCT using a validated calcium quantification application. Participants underwent a 3 T-MRI and prospective comprehensive cognitive clinical and laboratory assessments at enrollment, 6, 12, and 24-months. Results: Data were available for 531 participants (67.4 years, 59.5 males). The incidence of PSCI at two-years doubled in the high ICCS group (26 vs. 13.7, p  0.001). The high ICCS group had significantly greater small-vessel-disease (SVD) tissue changes and reduced microstructural-integrity assessed by Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI) maps (p  0.05 for all). In multivariate analysis, a higher ICCS was independently associated with brain atrophy manifested by lower normalized white and gray matter, hippocampal and thalamic volumes (β  -0.178, β  -0.2, β  -0.137, β  -0.157; p  0.05) and independently predicted PSCI (OR 1.83,. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the ICCS, which is a simple and readily available imaging marker on NCCT, is associated with brain atrophy, microstructural damage, the extent of SVD, and may predict PSCI. This finding has implications for identifying individuals at risk for PSCI and implementing targeted interventions to mitigate this risk.",

    "Background": {
      "text": "Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a significant longterm complication affecting stroke survivors and contributing to the global burden of dementia (1). Risk factors for PSCI include age, lower education, socioeconomic disparities, pre-existing cognitive decline, and vascular risk-profile (2). Atherosclerosis, a common cause of vascular diseases (3) is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction (4)(5)(6)(7)(8). Clinical assessment of atherosclerosis focuses on identifying risk factors for acute vascular events (9). These risk assessment tools fail to reflect the ongoing effects of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression on adjacent brain tissue. The extent to which atherosclerosis exerts a chronic silent effect leading to tissue dysfunction is unclear.\nVascular calcifications are a surrogate for atherosclerosis and act as its established pathological feature in different vascular beds (10). Local inflammation, glycemic and lipid control promote osteogenic differentiation in vascular cells within the atheroma, causing mineralization (11). Recent publications showed correlation between the systemic atherosclerotic load, as assessed by quantitative calcium calculations, and cognitive function (12). The Coronary Calcium Score (CAC), e.g., Agatston score, is the best-studied vascular calcification and is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis (13)(14)(15). It correlates with cognitive decline, consistent with the hypothesis that vascular injuries play a role in the development of dementia (12,16). Similarly, the extent of vascular calcifications in other arterial beds was shown to correlate with cognitive decline (12,16,17) and increased mortality (18). Intracranial calcifications (ICC) were first observed in the 1960s using ex-vivo radiography and pathology investigations. Although ICC are frequently observed on Non-Contrast CT(NCCT), their clinical significance was not investigated until recent years.\nNeuroimaging features are important predictors for PSCI (19). Previous studies have primarily investigated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, such as the location and volume of stroke, measures of brain atrophy, and markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) (19). Furthermore, intracranial stenosis, as detected by CT angiography (CTA), is also associated with an increased risk of PSCI (20,21).\nThere is increasing evidence linking ICC to elevated stroke rates, imaging-verified SVD markers (22), and their influence on stroke outcomes following endovascular thrombectomy (23). However, there is currently a lack of data examining the association between intracranial calcifications as an imaging marker and the risk of future PSCI.\nIn this study, we employed a semi-automated quantitative calculation of the ICC to create the ICC-score (ICCS), allowing us to quantify the calcium load in the main intracranial vessels in a large prospective cohort of cognitively intact mild stroke survivors.\nOur objective was to investigate the potential association between ICCS and a range of radiological and clinical outcomes, including brain atrophy, microstructural integrity, SVD markers and long-term cognitive function, and asses its utility as an imaging marker for PSCI.",

      "text": "This study represents an analysis of data obtained from a singlecenter prospective cohort study known as the Tel-Aviv-brain-acutestroke cohort (TABASCO) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01926691), whose detailed design and protocol have been previously described (24). Patients included were men and women over 50 years old, admitted within 72 h after a first-ever acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), with a total NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 17. Exclusion criteria: stroke that resulted from traumainvasive procedures, hemorrhagic stroke, a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment before the stroke (determined by Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score  3.3) (25), severe aphasia or disability which made the possibility of follow-up unlikely.\nThe cohort consisted of 575 consecutive eligible patients who were recruited between April 1st, 2008 and December 1st, 2014, with a prospective follow-up period ranging from 2 to 8 years. Figure 1 shows the flow chart of patient and data selection for this current analysis.\nAll participants signed informed consent forms, approved by the local ethics committee.\nPatients completed a baseline neuropsychological assessment including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) (26) and the NeuroTrax computerized cognitive testing (NeuroTrax Corp., Bellaire, TX) (27) during the first days after the stroke. These comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months (28). A Global Cognitive Score was computed as the average of the six index scores (memory, executive functions, visuospatial perception, verbal function, attention and motor skills) as previously described (28). All scores were normalized according to stratifications of age and education to give a distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. All cognitive assessments were done using different validated versions for repeated measures. Complete cognitive assessments 2-years after the index event were available for 507 (88) participants due to loss of follow-up. Additionally, detailed neurostatus and laboratory assessments were performed throughout the follow-up period, including polymorphism of genes of interest such as Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE) as previously describe (29).",

The calcium quantification analysis was performed using the Philips portal software HeartBeat CS application version 9 in a semi-automated manner. The readers were blinded to all clinical and radiological data, including stroke location and volume. To ensure the accuracy of the results, inter-observer reliability was assessed by evaluating 15 scans, yielding an intra-class correlation score of 0.98 (95 CI 0.961-0.996).\nExperienced vascular neurologist (ES) and neuro-radiologists (US, SG, IB) calculated the ICCS by analyzing NCCT images in axial planes with a bone window. The ICCS was obtained by summing the calcium content in the proximal intracranial arteries, which include the internal carotid, vertebral, and basilar arteries. The Agatston method (14, 15) was used to analyze areas with a density greater than 130 Hounsfield units (Hu). The software automatically highlighted areas with a density greater than 130 HU, as shown in Figure 2. A region-of-interest (ROI) was manually contoured in each of the aforementioned vessels in all axial slices showing the vessel to measure the peak attenuation of all intracranial vessels. The readers adjusted the windowlevel and followed the anatomical contour of the vessels to ensure only vessels were included in the analysis. All ROIs were carefully examined on zoomed images and manually contoured to ensure that the bony base-of-skull was not incorporated in the analysis.\nThe ICCS was obtained for each artery by multiplying the plaque area by a weighted peak attenuation score, as routinely done when calculating the Agatston score. The weighted peak attenuation was calculated using a cofactor of 1-4, depending on the Hounsfield unit range: cofactor 1 (130-199 Hu), cofactor 2 (200-299 Hu), cofactor 3 (300-399 Hu), and cofactor 4 (400 Hu).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we assessed the extent of intracranial calcifications using the ICCS in a large prospective cohort of cognitively intact mild stroke survivors. We investigated the relationship between ICCS and advanced brain MRI analyses, as well as long-term cognitive measures. In our cohort, ICCS was associated with MRI-proven tissue damage at the time of enrollment including: cerebral SVD markers, brain atrophy, and NAWM microstructural damage. Additionally, ICCS was significantly associated with worse cognitive function at all time points up to 24-months post stroke, and higher scores were linked with a higher likelihood of developing PSCI. This score independently predicted PSCI 2-years after the index event.\nPSCI is a common, devastating, and poorly understood complication of stroke, affecting up to 30 of stroke survivors (11). While it is traditionally related to age, stroke severity, and vascular risk factors (2), it is only partially explained by additional infarcts following the index event or secondary degeneration of brain structures. In our study population of minor stroke survivors who were cognitively intact at the time of image acquisition, ICCS showed a significant association with all SVD markers, brain atrophy, and microstructural damage, independent of age, gender, and vascular risk factors. These findings align with previously published data showing a correlation between ICCS and sub-cortical tissue damage, specifically SVD markers (40). Our study also found that ICCS independently correlated with microstructural damage in the NAWM and brain atrophy, specifically in brain structures crucial for cognitive function, such as the thalamus and hippocampus. Notably, there are no published studies assessing the ICCS in association with such detailed brain atrophy measures and DTI analyses.\nThe ICCS is a reliable measure of intracranial arterial calcifications on NCCT imaging and is considered a hallmark of atherosclerosis (10). Consistent with previous literature on vascular calcification in intracranial and other vascular beds (13,17), we found that individuals with high ICCS also had a higher vascular risk factor profile, including diabetes and hypertension, a greater likelihood of large vessel atherosclerosis and more severe strokes (41). However, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk profile, individuals with a higher ICCS still demonstrated an association with greater MRI proven tissue damage, significant detailed brain atrophy and microstructural damage of the NAWM on DTI analysis as demonstrated in Table 2. This suggests a potential direct effect of the ongoing atherosclerotic process on brain tissue. We hypothesize that the atherosclerotic tissue may directly promote pathological processes in the distal microcirculation, leading to microangiopathic changes. Atherosclerotic tissue is a source of inflammatory activity that generates downstream micro-emboli containing fibrin, platelet clots, plaque debris, and inflammatory cytokines (42). These micro-emboli can accelerate pathological changes in the small penetrating arteries, leading to ischemic white matter changes and subsequent brain atrophy. Atherosclerosis-related luminal stenosis can induce hemodynamic changes, which in conjunction with small platelet aggregates or cholesterol micro-emboli shed from the diseased arterial wall, may play important roles in chronic cognitive decline, even in the absence of recurrent acute vascular occlusion.\nPrevious cross-sectional studies have shown an association between vascular calcifications and cognitive function (22). Our study supports these findings, demonstrating a strong association between the ICCS and cognitive function at enrollment, as well as at all follow-up time points up to 2 years following the index event, independent of age, gender, stroke severity, and known risk factors for PSCI. Furthermore, higher ICCS scores predicted and were associated with an increased likelihood of developing future PSCI and dementia.\nAn exploratory subgroup analysis was conducted on individuals who underwent a CTA, demonstrated that the degree of overall cranio-cervical vessel stenosis significantly correlated with the ICCS, as expected. However, it is noteworthy that even in individuals without arterial stenosis, the ICCS still retained its independent correlation with long-term PSCI. This finding may suggest that proximal atherosclerosis can influence the downstream vascular tree through mechanisms other than hemodynamic restriction secondary to luminal narrowing. The pathophysiology underlying the association between ICCS and cognition, whether through direct hemodynamic effects due to arterial stenosis or as a result of local plaque formation and stability, requires further investigation and additional studies are required to establish a causative relationship.\nOur findings highlight the potential utility of the ICCS as an imaging marker for future brain dysfunction. In the field of cardiology, CAC has been established as a predictor of coronary stenosis and risk of myocardial infarction, and is routinely used for individual patient prognostication (14,15). Similarly, the ICCS, which measures a (22). Our study further suggests that the ICCS retains its predictive role for future PSCI, assessed up to 24 months after the index event. NCCT is a widely used and easily accessible imaging modality for stroke patients due to its speed, reliability, and costeffectiveness. As such, the ICCS has potential usefulness as a readily available and rapidly obtainable marker of arterial calcifications. In our cohort it acted as a better predictor for PSCI compared to other well-known MRI imaging markers for PSCI. While the ICCS should not replace MRI as an important imaging modality, it may serve as a valuable bedside prognostic tool and help guide the need for aggressive risk factor management, similar to the CAC in the field of cardiology.\nOur study has several limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, the ICCS is a crude measure that does not account for non-calcified soft atherosclerotic plaques, which are considered more unstable and may play a more important role in the pathophysiology of brain atherosclerosis. Second, although our data supports the association between ICCS and PSCI, we cannot establish a causative relationship. Additional limitations include the lack of follow-up imaging and the inclusion of only patients with mild clinical stroke manifestations.\nMoreover, the majority of our study population consisted of Caucasians, which limits our ethnic diversity and the external validity of our findings. Larger studies with a more ethnically diverse population are needed to assess the generalizability and practical application of the ICCS in various ethnic groups. Lastly, even though the loss to follow-up was relatively modest, there was likely some selection bias regarding the long-term cognitive results. Multiple imputations were used to address this problem and provide an estimate of probable cognitive results in patients lost to follow-up. We used many predictor variables, demonstrating consistent results. Also, no differences were observed in baseline characteristics between participants included and not included in the current analysis. Thus, it seemed reasonable to assume that data were missing at random. Under the assumption of missing at random, we may obtain valid inferences by applying the multiple imputation technique. Analysis of the observed data set (including imputed values) revealed the same trend of results for cognitive scores.\nThe study has several strengths, including its prospective design, long-term detailed cognitive follow-up, and extensive and advanced MRI analyses for most participants.\nIn order to thoroughly assess the reliability of ICCS as an imaging marker for predicting cognitive prognosis and determine its practicality in clinical decision-making, along with establishing cut-off values for clinically significant ICCS in stroke survivors, it is imperative to conduct larger studies that encompass a more diverse ethnic population. Furthermore, future investigations should focus on exploring and validating a straightforward visual scoring system based on ICCS, which could potentially provide benefits to clinicians in a bedside setting.",

      "text": "The ICCS is a simple and easily obtainable score based on semiautomatic analysis of NCCT. Our study found that in mild stroke survivors with intact cognition, ICCS was associated with brain atrophy, microstructural tissue damage, cerebral SVD, and higher rates of prospective PSCI. Furthermore, ICCS independently predicted cognitive deterioration 24 months after the stroke. The use of ICCS may help guide post-stroke prognostication and lead to individualized therapy by adjusting treatment targets in stroke survivors.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To quantify 18-month changes in white matter microstructure in premanifest (pre-HD) and symptomatic Huntingtons disease (symp-HD). To investigate baseline clinical, cognitive and motor symptoms that are predictive of white matter microstructural change over 18 months. Method: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed for 28 pre-HD, 25 symp-HD, and 27 controls scanned at baseline and after 18 months. Unbiased tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) methods were used to identify longitudinal changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of white matter. Stepwise linear regression models were used to identify baseline clinical, cognitive, and motor measures that are predictive of longitudinal diffusion changes. Results: Symp-HD compared to controls showed 18-month reductions in FA in the corpus callosum and cingulum white matter. Symp-HD compared to pre-HD showed increased RD in the corpus callosum and striatal projection pathways. FA in the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus callosum was significantly associated with a baseline clinical motor measure (Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale: total motor scores: UHDRS-TMS) across both HD groups. This measure was also the only independent predictor of longitudinal decline in FA in all parts of the corpus callosum across both HD groups. Conclusions: We provide direct evidence of longitudinal decline in white matter microstructure in symp-HD. Although pre-HD did not show longitudinal change, clinical symptoms and motor function predicted white matter microstructural changes for all gene positive subjects. These findings suggest that loss of axonal integrity is an early hallmark of neurodegenerative changes which are clinically relevant.",

      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathology that spreads beyond its well-known targets in the basal ganglia (Cudkowicz and Kowall, 1990;Li and Conforti, 2012). In particular, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have documented atrophy in the caudate and putamen, as well as in wide spread cortical regions (i.e., frontal and parietal lobes) (Dominguez et al., 2013;Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013a;Rosas et al., 2002;Rosas et al., 2011;Tabrizi et al., 2009). Importantly, gray matter atrophy has been shown to parallel localized abnormalities in white matter pathways, including striatal projection fibers and corpus callosum (Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008;Poudel et al., 2014;Rosas et al., 2010;Tabrizi et al., 2009). However, these white matter microstructural changes, measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have only been cross-sectional in design (Rosas et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2006) and thus provide limited insights on the development and progression of such changes, or how they may relate to functional outcomes. The only previous longitudinal study of white matter microstructure was not sensitive enough to differentiate HD individuals from healthy controls, possibly due to limitations in methodology and very small sample size (N  7) (Weaver et al., 2009). Hence, a longitudinal investigation is necessary to better characterize changes in white matter microstructure over time, identify factors that may predict these changes, and provide potential new biomarkers to track the effectiveness of potential therapeutics.\nIn this study we investigated whether: i) pre-HD and symp-HD individuals, compared to healthy controls, show 18-month longitudinal change in whole brain white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD); and, ii) baseline clinical symptoms, cognitive and motor functions in pre-HD and symp-HD are predictive of such changes. We applied an unbiased tensor based registration approach (Keihaninejad et al., 2013), followed by a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis of whole brain white matter. Based on previous findings (Rosas et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2006) we hypothesized that both pre-HD and symp-HD groups would show longitudinal change in white matter microstructure in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and striatal projection white matter pathways, and, that baseline clinical symptoms, cognitive and motor functions would be predictive of such changes.",

      "text": "FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) (http:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl fslwikiFDT) was used for eddy current correction and elimination of motion artifacts. For the TBSS analysis, we estimated rigid registration parameters between each gradient and baseline image of the original diffusion weighted images and removed participants with large motion spikes. Based on this method six participants were removed from subsequent analyses (four symp-HD, one pre-HD, and one control). This step reduces measurement noise and improve reproducibility of microstructure in white matter tracts. Diffusion tensor images were then generated for each participant using the diffusion tensor imaging toolkit (DTI-TK). An unbiased approach recently described and used (Keihaninejad et al., 2013) was chosen for the registration of the longitudinal DTI data, to develop an initial within-subject template from baseline and 18 months of diffusion tensors, and then to iteratively refine, first with affine and then with non-linear registrations. The within-subject templates were then used to create a study specific group-level template using iterative affine and non-linear registrations (Keihaninejad et al., 2013). The group-level population specific diffusion template was registered to an ICBM-152 space enhanced diffusion tensor template (Zhang et al., 2011) using a sequence of rigid, affine, and non-linear registrations. This method of registration of withinsubject data takes into account possible white matter atrophy over time HD. Furthermore, generation of inter-subject group-wise atlas eliminated the potential for bias in estimation of longitudinal changes. Finally, the composition of the mappings from subject space to within-subject template, within-subject template to population template, and population template to ICBM-152 standard template was used to normalize each subjects diffusion tensor data to the ICBM-152 template. For each participant, FA, RD, and AD data were estimated using the normalised tensor images.\nTract based spatial statistic analysis FA, RD, and AD data from each participant were further processed and analyzed using the tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis tool available in the FSL toolbox (Smith et al., 2006). A skeleton of white matter was generated by thresholding the mean FA map (FA N 0.2) and representing a single line running down the centers of all the common white matter fibers (Smith et al., 2006). Each participants normalized FA image was then projected onto this common skeleton to minimize any residual misalignment of tracts. The skeleton projection was then applied to RD and AD images to create a separate skeleton representing the RD and AD values. To estimate white matter microstructural change over 18 months for each participant, we subtracted baseline data (i.e., FA, RD, and AD skeleton) from 18 month data. The difference images were then used in a general linear model based analysis, which included predictors for four groups (pre-HD close , pre-HD far , all pre-HD, symp-HD, and controls) and three covariates (age, gender, and inter-scan interval). Statistical contrasts were defined for difference in change over time between symp-HD and controls, pre-HD close and controls, pre-HD far and controls, and symp-HD and overall pre-HD group. The model was estimated using the randomize tool available in FSL, which used non-parametric permutation based inference using 5000 permutations. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons across space using the threshold free cluster enhancement method (p b 0.05).",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "Statistical analyses of clinical and neurocognitive variables were performed using the MatLab Statistics Toolbox (MathWorks, Natik, MA, USA). Only the white matter regions showing significant changes in FA, RD, or AD over time in symp-HD or pre-HD, compared to controls, were selected for this analysis. White matter regions of interest were delineated using the JHU white matter atlas, by linearly and nonlinearly registering (FSL, FLIRT  FNIRT) average study specific FA map with JHU FA map. Partial correlation analyses with age and Disease Burden Score (DBS) as covariates were performed between percent change in FA and baseline UHDRS-TMS in the overall HD group (i.e., pre-HD and symp-HD combined). Disease Burden Score is a function of age and CAG repeat and indicates the pathological load of the mutated HTT protein (Penney et al., 1997). We considered correlations to be significant at p b 0.05 corrected using Bonferronis method. To investigate whether baseline clinical symptoms, cognitive and motor functions predict the longitudinal change in HD, stepwise linear regressions were performed with percent change in FA as dependent variables against four sets of independent variables: clinical (age, UHDRS-TMS, DBS), cognitive-quantified motor age, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Stroop word reading, Paced Tapping, and combined (age, UHDRS-TMS, DBS, SDMT, Stroop, Paced Tapping). Separate stepwise regressions were fitted for the clinical, cognitive, and combined models. Results were considered to be significant at p b 0.05. Our previous publications provide a more comprehensive summary of all neurocognitive tests used as part of the IMAGE-HD study (Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013a;Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013b;Poudel et al., 2013).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study characterized 18-month changes in white matter microstructure in pre-HD and symp-HD individuals. Symp-HD, compared to controls and pre-HD, showed decreased FA over 18-months in the corpus callosum and middle cingulum white matter. Symp-HD also showed 18-month increased RD in widespread white matter, but this change was only significant compared to the change in pre-HD. Change in FA in all parts of the corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium) was linearly associated with baseline UHDRS-TMS across both HD groups. UHDRS-TMS was also a significant independent predictor of longitudinal FA change in the body, genu, and splenium of corpus callosum. Baseline tapping performance across both HD groups was an independent predictor of the longitudinal decline in middle cingulum FA. These findings provide the first direct evidence for clinically relevant progressive decline in white matter microstructure in HD.\nLongitudinal change in white matter FA and RD in symp-HD supports our hypothesis of progressive decline of white matter microstructure in HD. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of longitudinal change in white matter microstructure in symp-HD, a characteristic that significantly differentiated symp-HD from both pre-HD and control groups. A previously published longitudinal study of white matter microstructure in HD reported only within-group reduction in similar white matter areas in a small group of n  7 (Weaver et al., 2009). Our findings are also consistent with previous cross-sectional studies demonstrating compromised white matter microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum and cingulum in HD (Dumas et al., 2012;Poudel et al., 2014;Rosas et al., 2010). Some changes in white matter microstructure have also been reported in pre-HD as early as 10 years prior to symptom onset (Rosas et al., 2010). Although the whole-brain TBSS analysis in the present study was not sensitive to longitudinal FA or RD change in pre-HD, a post-hoc comparison between pre-HD close and controls showed that FA change in the genu of corpus callosum may be sensitive to longitudinal progression as individuals approach onset. In symp-HD, the annual decrease of 1.5 in FA in all sections of the corpus callosum suggests that microstructural decline in this brain region accelerates after symptom onset.\nIn the symp-HD group, 18-month reduction in FA was also observed in the middle cingulum white matter. The cingulum, a collection of white matter tracts that interconnects the parietal, frontal, and motor cortices, is known to be prone to early degeneration in HD (Stoffers et al., 2010). In particular, the middle segment of cingulum, which shows changes in the current study, contains connections with premotor and motor cortical regions. Since motor and pre-motor cortical gray matter may represent the first of the cortical structures to show neurodegeneration in HD (Rosas et al., 2002), 18-month reduction in the structural integrity of the white matter connecting these regions is not surprising. However, because measurable longitudinal changes in FA were observed only in symp-HD, and not in pre-HD, this suggests that longitudinal microstructural changes reflective of myelin damage may be sensitive only during the manifest stages of the disease. This finding is somewhat surprising since previous large-scale studies in pre-HD (Aylward et al., 2012;Tabrizi et al., 2013) have demonstrated longitudinal atrophy of white matter. However, it is important to note that microstructural changes during the pre-HD stage may be dynamic, depending on a number of factors including how far along the disease continuum the individual is in terms of estimated years to onset. It is also possible that the diffusivity changes during the premanifest stages are more variable and perhaps more dynamic over time compared with the diffusivity changes during the early manifest stages. Interestingly, we observed trends towards reduced RD over time in pre-HD (see Supplementary Table 1), which may be reflective of compensatory remyelination (Song et al., 2005). This may in-part explain the lack of a significant reduction in FA in the pre-HD group, which may be associated with myelin damage (See Supplementary Table 2).\nThe clinical relevance of the longitudinal findings is highlighted by the significant association between corpus callosum FA change and baseline UHDRS-TMS. This finding was further strengthened by stepwise regression modeling, which revealed UHDRS-TMS to be the most predictive marker of longitudinal decline in all parts of the corpus callosum. The UHDRS-TMS measures motor function and taps into symptomatology that is critical in HD diagnosis. The association between UHDRS and longitudinal change in corpus callosum microstructure may therefore reflect its sensitivity to disruption in interhemispheric structural connectivity in HD. The ensuing rapid loss of inter-hemispheric communication, due to deterioration of corpus callosum microstructure, may account for some of the symptoms evident in symptomatic HD that are not entirely explained by corticostriatal dysfunction.\nAlthough the specific cellular mechanism underlying changes in DTI measures remains unclear, our findings of decreased FA and increased RD over time in symp-HD may be explained by either loss of axonal fibers in HD, or HD-related demyelination, or both. In support of the first possibility, studies in animal models of HD have shown axonal degeneration associated with huntingtin aggregates. Postmortem studies in HD have also found decreases in pyramidal neurons and their axonal connections (Cudkowicz and Kowall, 1990). Support for the second explanation comes from post-mortem studies of pre-HD brains, which show significantly elevated densities of oligodendrocytes, perhaps due to a physiological attempt to repair and remyelinate (Myers et al., 1991). DTI studies have also shown that myelin pathology is reflected by an increase in RD, and not AD (Song et al., 2005). In the current study, decreased FA in the corpus callosum and cingulum white matter, accompanied by increased RD but no change in AD, is suggestive of progressive myelin pathology in HD.\nIn this study we used an unbiased tensor-based registration framework for investigating changes in whole brain white matter microstructure over time. Previous studies have primarily relied on scalar maps (e.g., FA) derived from the diffusion tensor to perform independent registrations to a standard template (Weaver et al., 2009), and have generally failed to differentiate longitudinal changes in HD from controls (Sritharan et al., 2010;Weaver et al., 2009). Registration of DTI data using full tensor information improves both specificity and precision for detecting longitudinal changes compared to standard scalar approaches (Keihaninejad et al., 2013). Registration of within-subject data in this study, using a non-linear method, also takes possible white matter atrophy over time into account, which is consistently reported in HD (Dominguez et al., 2013;Poudel et al., 2014;Tabrizi et al., 2013). Furthermore, generation of an inter-subject group-wise atlas eliminated the potential for bias in estimation of longitudinal changes. Hence, the significant findings from the current study represent biomarkers that are unbiased and are sensitive to neuropathology in HD.\nIn conclusion, this study has shown that symp-HD individuals are particularly vulnerable to a rapid change in white matter microstructure, which can be observed over periods as short as 18 months. Although no significant change in microstructure was detected during the pre-HD stage, baseline clinical symptoms (UHDRS-TMS) and Paced Tapping were predictive of change in white matter microstructure in overall pre-HD and symp-HD over 18 months. Thus, change in white matter microstructure may be a candidate biomarker for consideration in future clinical trials.",

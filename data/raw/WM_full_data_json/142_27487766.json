    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment is the second most common form of dementia. The pathogenic pathways leading to vascular cognitive impairment remain unclear but clinical and experimental data have shown that chronic reactive astrogliosis occurs within white matter lesions, indicating that a sustained pro-inflammatory environment affecting the white matter may contribute towards disease progression. To model vascular cognitive impairment, we induced prolonged mild cerebral hypoperfusion in mice by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis. This chronic hypoperfusion resulted in reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia within white matter tracts, demyelination and axonal degeneration, consecutive spatial memory deficits, and loss of white matter integrity, as measured by ultra high-field magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. White matter astrogliosis was accompanied by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kB in reactive astrocytes. Using mice expressing a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kB under the control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-IkBα-dn), we found that transgenic inhibition of astroglial NF-kB signaling ameliorated gliosis and axonal loss, maintained white matter structural integrity, and preserved memory function. Collectively, our results imply that pro-inflammatory changes in white matter astrocytes may represent an important detrimental component in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment, and that targeting these pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterised by impaired cognitive function attributable to cerebrovascular pathology 1. In its pure form, VCI is the second most common form of dementia and represents an important co-factor for the development of Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders 2. Neuropathologically, VCI is characterised by demyelination and axonal loss within white matter tracts 3, which has traditionally been attributed to the direct effects of chronic oxygen deprivation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that chronic neuroinflammation may also play a detrimental role in the initiation and progression of VCI. First, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, which are risk factors for VCI, induce a chronic pro-inflammatory environment, particularly in and around blood vessels 4,5. Second, increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers have been detected within white matter lesions in animal models and post-mortem studies of VCI patients 6,7, and alterations of blood-brain barrier integrity are a central and perhaps aggravating element of VCI 8,9. Finally, in patients and animal models of VCI, reactive gliosis of microglia and astrocytes is present within the white matter 10,11. Reactive astrogliosis is a pervasive defence mechanism in response to cerebral injury that may promote neurodegeneration or neuroprotection in a context-dependent manner 12. However, the roles of astrogliosis and the various inflammatory cascades mediated by reactive astrocytes in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and VCI remain poorly understood.\nHere, we have used an animal model that recapitulates many of the neuropathological and behavioural hallmarks of VCI 13. We demonstrate that reactive astrogliosis induces activation of the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway in astrocytes, and that transgenic inhibition of this pathway confers protection against axonal loss, helps to promote white matter integrity, and preserves cognitive function.",

Following contrast enhancement (0.4  saturated pixels), images were binarised with a threshold defined as the mean background intensity plus the standard deviation of background intensity multiplied by 3. Astrocyte area coverage and diameter, and micoglial cell count were determined automatically by ImageJ. For astrocyte process length, binarised images were skeletonised and analysed using the Analyze Skeleton (2D3D) plugin for ImageJ. These semi-automatic quantifications were compared with a subset of data (n  3 from each group) that was quantified by manual analysis; no significant difference was detected between the analysis methods (data not shown). GFAP-positive astrocytes were considered positive for p65 when they showed a spherical somatic p65 staining that was smaller than the GFAP-positive cell soma and overlapped with the Hoechst 33258 nuclear counterstain. Mean pixel intensity of SMI312 staining in 8-bit grey level images was taken as a measure of axonal integrity. Demyelination was analysed in LFB-stained sections using a semi-quantitative scoring system (0  no demyelination; 1  visible fiber disarrangement; 2  vacuoles and focal demyelination; 3  widespreadcontinuous demyelination). Examples are provided in Additional file 1: Figure S1. Analysis of the corpus callosum was performed within pre-defined areas (0.75 mm and 2.0 mm from the midline). All measurements were taken in triplicates, and the values averaged. Laser speckle contrast data were down-sampled, exported into Excel (Microsoft), and normalised to perfusion levels before microcoil implantation. Paravision 5.1 (Bruker) was used to generate the parametric images used for white matter analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured. Direction-encoded colour (DEC) maps based on the primary eigenvectors were generated using inhouse software. The colour determines the principal direction (X, Y or Z) of the primary eigenvector exhibiting the largest diffusion coefficient from the measured diffusion tensor: red designates medial to lateral orientation, blue represents dorsal to ventral orientation and green exhibits the rostral to caudal orientation. Regions of interest (ROIs) including the corpus callosum, external capsule and internal capsule were manually drawn onto the diffusion tensor images, and verified by comparison with the corresponding T 2 -w image and a stereotaxic mouse brain atlas 20. Heatmaps were generated by a) registering the FA images to a reference image within the respective cohort and b) setting landmarks on trace-weighted diffusion images and transferring them onto their respective FA images.

      "text": "We modified a model of bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) 13 by placing microcoils around both common carotid arteries to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in mice (Fig. 1a). Longitudinal laser speckle imaging demonstrated a reduction in cerebral blood flow by 32  9  24 h and 29  8  7 days following BCAS induction, respectively, whereas blood flow remained unaltered in sham-treated mice (Fig. 1b-c). Separate cohorts of mice, perfused either 1 week or 6 weeks after BCAS induction, exhibited white matter demyelination (Fig. 1d), reactive astrogliosis (Fig. 1e-g), microglial activation (Fig. 1h), and delayed degradation of white matter axonal integrity (Fig. 1i). Reactive astrogliosis was evident by increased area coverage, cell size and process length, although the latter parameter is also influenced by GFAP redistribution induced by astrogliosis 12. The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the corpus callosum did not differ between the groups, owing to the high fraction of GFAP-positive astrocytes already present in the white matter (148  12mm 2 Additional file 2: Figure S2. Changes comparable to those observed in the corpus callosum were detected in the internal capsule and external capsule (Additional file 3: Figure S3). Moreover, we found that the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, were increased in homogenates of the corpus callosum isolated from mice subjected to BCAS (Fig. 1j).\nTo investigate spatial long-term memory, we used a two-trial Y maze spatial memory task 19. In the first trial (acquisition), mice were allowed to visit two arms of the maze, while the third arm was blocked. In the second trial (retrieval) performed 24 h later, mice had access to all three arms. As expected, given the natural tendency of rodents to explore new environments, sham-treated mice showed a strong preference for the novel arm in the retrieval trial (Fig. 2a-b). By contrast, mice subjected to BCAS showed no preference for the novel arm (Fig. 2b), indicating decreased spatial memory function. Spontaneous locomotor activity and the level of anxiety, which were investigated in the open field test, did not differ between the groups (Fig. 2c-e) indicating that the deficits of hypoperfused mice in the Y maze test were due to impaired memory function and not to a decline in motor function or general behavioural alterations.",

    "NF-kB is activated by chronic hypoperfusion in reactive white matter astrocytes": {
      "text": "One consequence of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 is the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kB signaling cascade in reactive astrocytes 21. Under control conditions, inactive NF-kB is localised to the cytoplasm by its interaction with inhibitory IkB proteins such as IkBα. Dissociation from IkB and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kB is initiated by the degradation of IkB through cytokine-induced IkB kinase activation 22. Once activated, NF-kB acts as an important regulator of reactive gliosis, inflammation, myelination and neuronal survival in different disease models 12,14,23.\nTherefore, we investigated the occurrence of activated nuclear NF-kB by immunohistochemistry against the active p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-kB. We found that 27.2  7.1  of all GFAP-positive white matter reactive astrocytes in hypoperfused mice were positive for nuclear (i.e. active) p65 (n  7 mice; Fig. 3a). By contrast, only sparse and cytosolic (i.e. inactive) p65 labeling was visible in astrocytes from sham-treated mice (3.8  1.8 , n  6 mice; Fig. 3b). White matter microglia and neurons were only very rarely positive for nuclear p65 in chronic hypoxic mice (3.4  0.9  of Iba1-positive microglia and 0. These data indicate that the majority of white matter NF-kB activation in our model occurs in astrocytes. To quantify NF-kB activity, we used a chemiluminescent assay measuring the amount of p65 bound to the flanked DNA binding consensus sequence for NF-kB in nuclear extracts from brain homogenates. Consistent with the immunohistochemistry, this assay demonstrated strong NF-kB activation in the brains of mice subjected to BCAS compared with sham (Fig. 3c). These data indicate that reactive astrogliosis and chronic inflammation of the white matter in hypoperfused mice induces NF-kB activation in reactive astrocytes.",

    "Astrocyte-specific transgenic inhibition of NF-kB activity confers protection against structural and cognitive decline following chronic hypoperfusion": {
      "text": "To investigate the consequences of astroglial NF-kB activation, we used transgenic GFAP-IkBα-dn mice in which astroglial NF-kB activation is selectively inhibited by targeting the overexpression of a dominant negative form of IkBα to astrocytes 14. Earlier studies have shown that the transgene is selectively active in astrocytes, while NF-kB activity remains unchanged in neurons 14. Following BCAS, we found that nuclear p65 was absent from reactive white matter astrocytes (Fig. 3d) and that NF-kB activity was similar to sham-treated mice (Fig. 3c).\nThe level and time course of cerebral blood flow reduction (Fig. 4a) and the plasticity of the posterior communicating artery (PcomA; Fig. 4b) were similar in GFAP-IkBα-dn and wildtype mice (Laser speckle blood flow levels from each individual day of measurement were compared between GFAP-IkBα-dn and wildtype mice; p  0.05 for each comparison, Mann-Whitney test). Thus, differences between these groups are unlikely to be due to variability in the degree of hypoperfusion or collateralisation between the anterior and posterior cerebral artery circulation.\nInterestingly, astrogliosis was detectable in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice following BCAS but reactive microglial activation and demyelination in white matter structures were significantly attenuated (Fig. 4c-e). Furthermore, axonal integrity within the corpus callosum was preserved in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice compared with shamtreated controls (Fig. 4f ). Importantly, GFAP-IkBα-dn mice subjected to hypoperfusion spent significantly more time in the novel arm in the retrieval trial of the Y maze test (Fig. 4g), indicating preserved spatial memory function as a consequence of decreased NF-kB signaling. The open field test revealed no differences in distance moved, velocity or time spent in the surround between hypoperfused GFAP-IkBα-dn, sham-treated GFAP-IkBαdn and wildtype mice (Fig. 4h-j). Overall, these data show that NF-kB activation in reactive astrocytes contributes to neuropathological damage and behavioural changes in our VaD model. of patients with vascular dementia 24,25. Therefore, we investigated whether the preservation of axonal integrity observed in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice was detectable by DTI MRI. DTI was performed on hypoperfused or sham-treated wildtype and GFAP-IkBα-dn mice 6 weeks post surgery. Coronal images from brain areas encompassing the major white matter tracts (corpus callosum, internal capsule and external capsule) were acquired, and fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured. Representative direction-encoded colour (DEC) maps are shown in Fig. 5a. We detected significant changes in white matter FA, ADC, AD and RD values in wildtype mice subjected to BCAS compared with sham-treated mice (Fig. 5b-e and Additional file 4: Figure S4). This indicates that hypoperfusion induced deterioration in white matter integrity consistent with the observed histopathological changes. By contrast, GFAP-IkBα-dn mice subjected to BCAS mice did not exhibit a difference in the diffusivity measures when compared with sham-treated GFAP-IkBα-dn mice, underlining the strong attenuation in pathology compared with wildtype animals (Fig. 5b-e).

Importantly, clinical and experimental studies have shown that vascular impairment is associated with inflammatory changes and Fig. 4 GFAP-IkBα-dn mice are protected from the deleterious effects of chronic hypoperfusion. a Laser speckle contrast imaging of GFAP-IkBα-dn mice demonstrated cerebral hypoperfusion after BCAS compared with sham-treated mice (p  0.05, Mann-Whitney test) similar to blood flow levels observed in wildtype mice shown in Fig. 1. b India ink angiograms revealed that the patencydevelopment of the posterior communicating artery (PComA) was similar in wildtype and GFAP-IkBα-dn mice (n  5 for each group; p  0.05, Mann-Whitney test). c-f Reactive astrogliosis was evident in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice after BCAS. However, microgliosis, demyelination and loss of axonal integrity were strongly ameliorated (6 weeks after BCAS; n  6 for each group and staining; Mann-Whitney test for each comparison). g 6 weeks after BCAS, GFAP-IkBα-dn mice spent significantly more time in the novel arm during the retrieval trial of the Y maze compared to wildtype mice subjected to BCAS, indicating preserved spatial memory function (n  12 for each group; Mann-Whitney test; Two-way ANOVA: F(1, 46)  5.52, p  0.02 for genotype effect). h-j The distance travelled and velocity, as well as the level of anxiety, of GFAP-IkBα-dn mice subjected to sham surgery or BCAS did not differ significantly and was similar to wildtype mice. Wildtype mouse data in G-J correspond to those in Fig. 2 reactive gliosis of the white matter 45679, indicating that white matter damage is not simply a consequence of chronic oxygen deprivation but is induced and sustained by a pro-inflammatory environment. The hallmarks of chronic inflammation:reactive gliosis of white matter astrocytes and microglia, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, were also detected in our model and associated with axonal degeneration, demyelination, spatial memory impairment and loss of white matter integrity. Importantly, the DTI signatures of hypoperfused mice corroborated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed on histology 26, and were comparable to those observed in clinical vascular cognitive impairment 27. The cellular sources of IL-1 and IL-6 are difficult to define in vivo using our model. However, earlier studies have shown that microglia and, to a lesser degree, astrocytes release these cytokines during hypoxia 1,23,28. Hence, both cell types may induce and sustain the pro-inflammatory environment that ultimately leads to demyelination. Moreover, progressive demyelination may further exacerbate gliosis 28.\nReactive astrogliosis is a pervasive but insufficiently understood response mechanism of the brain to acute or chronic injury 12. Interestingly, we found that astrogliosis induces activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-kB pathway, and that transgenic inhibition of NF-kB signaling in reactive astrocytes confers protection from degeneration and cognitive impairment. Notably, some degree of gliosis was evident in transgenic mice after BCAS, indicating that multiple pathways may be involved 12. The protective effect of NF-kB on white matter integrity was also detectable using DTI, underlining the significance of DTI as a longitudinal marker of treatment response in future translational studies.\nIt should be noted that the model used in the present study, and arguably in previously published animal studies thus far 11, does not reflect certain aspects of clinical IκBα-dn BCAS IκBα-dn Sham Fig. 5 Ultra high-field diffusion tensor imaging reveals preserved structural integrity of major white matter tracts in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice. a Anaesthetised wildtype or GFAP-IkBα-dn mice, either shamtreated or subjected to BCAS, were imaged using ultra high-field DTI MRI. Major white matter tracts (CC, corpus callosum; IC, internal capsule; EC, external capsule) were identified in direction-encoded colour (DEC) images (red, medial to lateral orientation; blue, dorsal to ventral orientation; green, rostral to caudal orientation) based on the primary eigenvectors. b Fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in all regions of interest in wildtype but not in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice subjected to BCAS. c BCAS induced significant changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the internal capsule and external capsule in wildtype but not in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice. d-e Axial and radial diffusivity were also significantly altered in wildtype but not in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice subjected to BCAS (wildtype sham, n  6; wildtype BCAS, n  5; GFAP-IkBα-dn sham, n  3; GFAP-IkBα-dn BCAS, n  5; Mann-Whitney test for all comparisons) vascular cognitive impairment including the chronic evolution of the disease over decades, the predominant affection of small vessels, and cardiovascular and environmental co-morbidities. Therefore, an important question for future studies is whether the protective effect of NF-kB inhibition is evident in models that recapitulate other aspects of human vascular cognitive impairment. One other important point to address will be whether astroglial NF-kB contributes to pathways such as those mediated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 activation or perturbed glutamate uptake 29, in models of vascular cognitive impairment. Furthermore, as NF-kB pathway inhibitors progress through pre-clinical development 31, it will be of great interest to investigate whether these compounds confer comparable protection from chronic hypoxia.\nThe NF-kB pathway has been implicated in other pathological conditions such as autoimmune or toxic demyelination and spinal cord injury 14,23,32. Here, we demonstrated that activation of NF-kB in astrocytes contributes not only to white matter demyelination and axonal loss during chronic hypoxia but that an astrocytic pro-inflammatory pathway may have important consequences for cognitive outcome in neurodegenerative disease.",

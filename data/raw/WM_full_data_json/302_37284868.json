    "abstract": "Objectives Venous pathology could contribute to the development of parenchymal lesions in cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). We aim to identify presumed periventricular venous infarction (PPVI) in CADASIL and analyze the associations between PPVI, white matter edema, and microstructural integrity within white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) regions. Methods We included forty-nine patients with CADASIL from a prospectively enrolled cohort. PPVI was identified according to previously established MRI criteria. White matter edema was evaluated using the free water (FW) index derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and microstructural integrity was evaluated using FW-corrected DTI parameters. We compared the mean FW values and regional volumes with different levels of FW (ranging from 0.3 to 0.8) in WMHs regions between the PPVI and non-PPVI groups. We used intracranial volume to normalize each volume. We also analyzed the association between FW and microstructural integrity in fiber tracts connected with PPVI. Results We found 16 PPVIs in 10 of 49 CADASIL patients (20.4). The PPVI group had larger WMHs volume (0.068 versus 0.046, p  0.036) and higher FW in WMHs (0.55 versus 0.52, p  0.032) than the non-PPVI group. Larger areas with high FW content were also found in the PPVI group (threshold: 0.7, 0.47 versus 0.37, p  0.015; threshold: 0.8, 0.33 versus 0.25, p  0.003). Furthermore, higher FW correlated with decreased microstructural integrity (p  0.009) in fiber tracts connected with PPVI. Conclusions PPVI was associated with increased FW content and white matter degeneration in CADASIL patients. Clinical relevance statement PPVI is an important factor related with WMHs, and therefore, preventing the occurrence of PPVI would be beneficial for patients with CADASIL. Key Points Presumed periventricular venous infarction is important and occurs in about 20 of patients with CADASIL. Presumed periventricular venous infarction was associated with increased free water content in the regions of white matter hyperintensities. Free water correlated with microstructural degenerations in white matter tracts connected with the presumed periventricular venous infarction.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene 1. Early studies estimated that the prevalence of NOTCH3 mutations was around 2-4100,000, but some recent studies demonstrated a much higher rate at 1 in 300-500 2. CADASIL has many similarities to sporadic CSVD with lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and thus, it can serve as a model to explore the pathogenesis of CSVD 3. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of subcortical infarcts and WMHs have not been fully understood in CADASIL.\nSubcortical infarct is usually assumed to be caused by an interruption of blood flow due to arterial abnormalities such as atherosclerosis or lipohyalinosis 4. However, venous pathology may also lead to subcortical infarcts. A recent postmortem study of patients with Alzheimers disease has reported that most periventricular infarctions are related to venous collagenosis, rather than arteriolosclerosis 5. Several CADASIL studies have observed venous collagenosis and decreased density of medullary veins in the regions of periventricular WMHs 6,7. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis revealed granular osmiophilic material (the pathological hallmark of CADASIL) deposition in both cerebral arteries and veins 8. Hitherto, little is known about periventricular venous infarction (PVI) in CADASIL.\nThe cerebral venous system plays an essential role in removing metabolic waste and regulating the balance of interstitial fluid (ISF) 9. ISF flows out of the brain through the veins and perivenous spaces 10,11. It also spreads along white matter tracts 12. Venous infarction in the deep white matter could cause increased hydrostatic pressure in upstream capillaries 13 and impair the ISF efflux pathways, resulting in the development of interstitial edema (i.e., extracellular edema) 14, which may further lead to fiber tract degeneration 15. Indeed, several recent studies showed increased water content in the white matter of CADASIL patients 16,17. Therefore, exploring the relationship between PVI and extracellular edema in WMHs regions has important implications for understanding the pathologies of white matter degeneration in CADASIL.\nIn the present study, we first studied the frequency of presumed PVI (PPVI) using MRI criteria in a cohort of CADASIL patients. Second, we analyzed the association between PPVI and extracellular edema within WMHs. Third, we investigated the relationship between extracellular edema and microstructural degenerations in white matter tracts connecting the PPVI. We hypothesized that PPVI would be associated with a higher burden of extracellular edema within WMHs, and white matter edema would correlate with microstructural degenerations in white matter tracts connected with the PPVI.",

      "text": "We identified chronic PPVI using the following MRI criteria 19,20 (Fig. 1A): (1) focal periventricular white matter lesions;\n(2) hypointense signals on both T1WI and FLAIR images; (3) black dots sign within lesions on SWI images; (4) gray matter sparing. The black dots sign on SWI images is important for differentiating PPVI from lacunes (Fig. 1B). Notably, PPVI should be distinguished from enlarged perivascular spaces which were round, oval, or linear,  3 mm in their maximum diameter, with smooth delineated contours surrounding the perforating arteries 21. To increase the visibility of the black dots sign within lesions and reduce the effects of noise and artifacts, we processed the SWI images using a new approach called CLEAR-SWI, which has the advantage of eliminating the phase warp artifacts. This method could improve image homogeneity and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with standard SWI methods 22. All images were reviewed by two experienced radiologists (X.F.Y. and X.D.) blind to clinical information. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.\nWe segmented PPVI based on T1WI images. Skullstripped T1WI images were segmented into three classes using FMRIBs Automated Segmentation Tool: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As the PPVI had the same signal as CSF, it appeared on the image of partial volume estimates for CSF (PVE-CSF). Thus, we obtained the PPVI mask from the PVE-CSF images by applying an intensity threshold and a region-growth method. Lacunes and perivascular spaces were carefully avoided and manually removed if they were mis-included. Finally, the PPVI volume was calculated. To avoid the influence of head size, we also calculated the intracranial volume (ICV) from the T1WI image using FreeSurfer and corrected the PPVI volume using ICV.",

Each PPVI mask was normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by applying the transformation matrix derived from registering the T1WI image to a brain template in the MNI space (1 mm 3 ) using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). Then, white matter tracts passing through each PPVI were reconstructed based on ten healthy controls tractography results 23. For each PPVI, tractography maps of the ten healthy controls were binarized and averaged together so that each voxel represented a probability of fiber pathways from 0 to 1 23. The mask of fiber pathways connecting the PPVI (FCI) was created by applying a threshold of 0.5. Both PPVI and FCI were then warped from the MNI space to the native diffusion space using the b  0 smm 2 (b0) image as the reference image.",

Both WMHs volume and ICV-corrected WMHs volume were measured.

The FW, FA, and FAt are dimensionless, and MD and MDt are in units of 10 -3 mm 2 s. The mean values of FW, FAt, MDt, FA, and MD were extracted from the masks of WMHs, WMHs  FCI, and WMHs -FCI for each patient.

We compared demographic, clinical, and neuroradiological variables between the PPVI and non-PPVI groups using Students t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fishers exact test for categorical data. We used linear mixed-effects models to compare the volumes of regions with different FW thresholds between the PPVI and non-PPVI groups, adjusting for WMHs volume and disease duration. Because FW volumes were not normally distributed, both FW volumes and ICV-corrected FW volumes were log10 transformed. We used Bonferronis correction to adjust for multiple comparisons and reported Bonferroni-corrected p values. We used paired t tests to examine the differences in diffusion parameters between WMHs  FCI and WMHs -FCI in the PPVI group. The effect size for mean difference (M diff  WMHs  FCI minus WMHs -FCI) in each diffusion metric was computed, and the corresponding 95 CI was constructed by bootstrapped resampling for 5000 resamples 29.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our study used MRI criteria to identify PPVI in CADASIL and found that PPVI was associated with increased extracellular edema in the regions of WMHs. Furthermore, extracellular edema correlated with microstructural degenerations in white matter tracts connecting the PPVI.\nPPVI existed in 20.4 of the patients. While PPVI and lacunes showed similar signals on conventional MR images, they exhibited different features on SWI images. PPVI had punctate hypointensities within the lesion, while lacunes usually had hypointense rims around the lesion. Furthermore, we found that PPVI mainly occurred at the center of WMHs, but lacunes were located at the edge of WMHs. The spatial relationship between lacunes and WMHs was consistent with a previous study 30. These findings provided additional clues to identify PPVI.\nOur unexpected finding was that PPVI had no association with the clinical symptoms, including transient ischemic attack or stroke, headache, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric disorders. It was possibly because neurological signs and symptoms are highly variable and even asymptomatic after cerebral vein occlusion 13. A variety of factors, such as sex, lesion location, lacunes, and microbleeds, are also related to clinical symptoms 3, which might have covered the effect of PPVI.\nVenous collagenosis has been recognized as a contributor to WMHs 5,6. It can lead to thickened vessel walls and venous hypertension, resulting in impaired ISF drainage and decreased cerebral blood flow 31. In sporadic CSVD, we have found that disrupted medullary veins were associated with increased ISF in the periventricular white matter 32. As a more severe form of venous pathology, PVI could not only cause increased hydrostatic pressure in upstream capillaries but also interrupt ISF drainage pathways, including perivenous spaces and white matter tracts. These pathologies would together cause extracellular edema 14. In line with these theories, we found that PPVI was associated with a higher burden of extracellular edema within WMHs.\nWe also found that extracellular edema was more pronounced and correlated with microstructural injury in white matter tracts connecting the PPVI. Interestingly, altered fluid mobility and water content might precede fiber tract damage 17, and reversing these pathologies might slow down the degeneration process 15. Nevertheless, further longitudinal studies are still needed to confirm the possible causal relationships.\nThe cause of PVI may be complicated. Venous collagenosis has been observed in the regions of periventricular infarcts in a recent postmortem study 5, suggesting that venous collagenosis may contribute to the development of PVI. From a genetic perspective, cerebral venous infarctions in adults are commonly secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis 33. Damage to the endothelial cell of the veins, Fig. 5 A-D The associations between FW and other diffusion parameters in subregions of WMHs  FCI and WMHs -FCI in the PPVI group. The dashed lines represent the mean values. The MD and MDt are in units of 10 -3 mm 2 s. p  0.05; p  0.005; p  0.001. NS., not significant; FW, free water; WMHs, white matter hyperintensities; FCI, fiber pathways connecting the PPVI; WMHs  FCI, FCI within WMHs; WMHs -FCI, WMHs without FCI; PPVI, presumed periventricular venous infarction; MD, mean diffusivity; MDt, tissue compartment MD; FA, fractional anisotropy; FAt, tissue compartment FA caused by the NOTCH3 gene mutations, seems to take part in venous thrombosis in CADASIL 34. Besides, the upregulation of collagen in the venule wall would also promote local thrombosis 35. Therefore, venous collagenosis and thrombosis may co-exist before the formation of PVI.\nOur study has several limitations. First, we identified PPVI according to the MRI criteria, and there was no histopathological confirmation. Future studies could analyze the accuracy of MRI criteria for identifying PPVI in animal models of CADASIL. Second, all patients were recruited from a single center, potentially producing biased results. It remains unknown whether the incidence of PPVI is underestimated or overestimated, although predisposition to PPVI may have a genetic basis 33. Multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings. Third, this is a cross-sectional study. Although there was an association between PPVI and extracellular edema within WMHs, it is still difficult to confirm a causal effect. Longitudinal studies are required to investigate the temporal relationship between PPVI and extracellular edema. Fourth, it should be noted that all PPVIs were detected at the chronic stage regarding their imaging characteristics. However, capturing the acute stage of PPVI seems to be difficult because patients with PPVI can present with non-specific symptoms, such as headaches. Last, the sample size is small, which limits the usage of multivariate analysis.\nIn conclusion, PPVI occurs in about 20 of patients with CADASIL and it was associated with a higher burden of extracellular edema within WMHs. Furthermore, extracellular edema correlated with microstructural degenerations in white matter tracts connected with PPVI. These results highlighted the importance of PPVI for white matter degeneration in CADASIL, which may help future preventive trials.",

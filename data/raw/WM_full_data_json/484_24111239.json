The fractional anisotropy (FA) metric has been used predominantly to study changes in the WM tracts. Here an attempt is made to delineate specific regions of interest in the WM that may be probable indicators for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Genetic algorithm has been used as feature reduction method along with Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) machine learning technique to determine the most prominent regions in the WM that are indicators of AD. It is found in this study that Fornix region of WM is most affected by Alzheimer. Further, classification was done to differentiate between Alzheimer and Normal controls with accuracy of 84.5. The results obtained were validated by comparing with the existing literature on Alzheimer.",

    "I. INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) causes major anatomical degeneration to the neurons and synapses in specific regions of hippocampus in the brain. Statistical estimates reveal that 1 in every 85 persons will have developed this dementia by 2050 1. As AD progresses, substantial damage is caused to the white matter (WM) tracts which, if left untreated can result in subsequent loss of memory leading to death of the patient 4. The clinical treatment available today is effective only in the early stages of disease thus detection of AD in its early stages is a pressing issue of the present times.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is one of the non-invasive in vivo techniques to probe the WM tracts in brain 3. DTI works on the probabilistic determination of diffusion of water molecules over a given time period in a tissue structure. This imaging technique is a modified MRI method which uses a variable gradient of magnetic field in required co-ordinate directions to map the diffusion of water molecules. Images are acquired in a minimum of six directional planes and are used to generate the voxel map. Due to varying magnitude of diffusion in each direction, the diffusion tensor acquires an ellipsoidal shape in three dimensional spaces. This can be used very effectively to study the cause of delineation of WM tracts resulting in the development of AD.\nThe most widely studied index of DTI is Fractional Anisotropy (FA).This gives a measure of the molecular displacement anisotropy of water in space 5. FA can be The characteristic study on WM has been carried out since long. Analysis on WM tracts is done using atlas based approach followed by manual segmentation to identify the abnormalities present. Kenichi et.al 6 used Atlas based approach to map all the regions of the WM using large deformation diffeomorphic mapping and analyzed WM deformity AD subject. Study done by White et.al demonstrated Voxel Based Analysis (VBA) 10 to delineate the region of interest in WM. To date many machine learning approaches have been used for the diagnosis of AD using MRI images. Laurence et.al The aim of present study is to investigate the specific regions in the white matter which are most affected by AD with an automated approach. Feature reduction technique and machine learning algorithm are used to achieve this objective. In this study genetic algorithm is used to identify specific regions in white matter which describes the AD pathology most efficiently. Further, an adaptive method of classifier development AdaBoost is applied to ascertain the prominence of each affected region by classifying AD from Normal Control (NC). A tree classifier is initialized in this study which on repeated iteration with weighted voting renders a highly efficient classifier. The regions best describing the classification accuracy obtained from this method were compared with those mentioned in literature. Most of the regions were found to be consistent to regions responsible for AD.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II deals with the steps involved in acquiring data, feature extraction, genetic algorithm for feature reduction and classification using adaptive method. Section III describes the classification results for the proposed method and discusses its relevance. Section IV concludes the study and highlights important research prospects of the current approach.",

    "D. Feature Extraction and Reduction": {
      "text": "FA values obtained from 50 regions of White matter using DTI maps forms the feature vector for each subject. Genetic Algorithm (GA) a dimension reduction technique is used in order to remove the redundant features and extract the prominent features which best describe the AD pathology.\nGA is influenced by natural selection and evolutionary growth 11 extensively explained by Charles Darwin. This optimization technique generates the best subset of available features. Binary encoding is used for the entire feature space which renders the preferred features as 1 and redundant features as 0. A random set of solutions is generated as the initial population.\nRandomly selected solutions are tested for fitness. The preferred features obtained as a result of selection is then modified 12. Further this process is iterated until an optimal solution is derived from the entire population. Each of the features is assigned a rank based on the predictive weight associated to each feature. Predictive weight for each feature vector is computed as follows 15.\nLet E be the individual subject from the set of samples S of the form B:T 1 , T 2 , T 3 å T J ; consisting of J feature vectors .The classifier output corresponding to the subject E is given by\nWhere 5  , 5  are the two classes of the samples space S.The fitness of each subject is calculated based on the classification accuracy obtained by the below formula\nwhere 62 is the number of subjects from O  that are correctly classified as that class, 60 is the number of subjects from O  that are correctly classified as that class, (0 is the number of subjects from O  that are incorrectly classified as the class O  and (2 is the number of subjects from O  that are incorrectly classified as class O  .\nLet S 1 , S 2 , S 3 å S J be the weights of the feature vector Initially all the features are considered equally important and the weight of the feature is assigned as\nThe weight of the E PD feature after t iterations is given by S E :P; Z S E :P F 1;  Ã ?KQJP (F ,E)BEP F Ã ?KQJP (F ,G)\nwhere BEPF is the fitness of the F PD program in the population, and ?KQJP(F, G) is the number of times the G PD feature appears in the F PD program in the population, and N is total number of subjects in sample space S.\nThe top ranked features representing the specific region of WM based on the weights are further fed to the classifier to ascertain the diagnostic relevance.",

    "E. Classification Method": {
      "text": "Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is a classification algorithm based on the enhancement technique 13. The performance of weak classifiers can be improved by repeated iteration using boosting methods. Each iteration aims at increasing the weights of misclassified data and decreasing that of classified data. This results in increased optimization of the classifier for a given dataset. The reduced feature vectors obtained after applying GA on the dataset are used as features for this classifier.\nThe algorithmic steps involved are as follows:\nN Inputs given: S  :x 1 , y 1 ;, å å , :x N , y N ; N Initialize: Equal weights were assigned to all inputs:\nc) Update weights:\nThe weight is normalized on each iteration by a factor Z t such that Ã d n :t1;  1 N n1\n.\nN Termination: The iteration ends if t  0 or t R and set T  t F 1.",

    "III. RESULTS": {
      "text": "Analysis of prominent features representing the WM regions, which are obtained after applying GA on the data set are further performed. Predictive weights for each of the features contributing to the classification accuracy are calculated. Top 10 regions of WM based on the predictive weights are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1 it can be inferred that Fornix which connects hippocampus to hypothalamus is the most affected region in AD subjects as this feature carries the maximum predictive weight.\nOther prominent regions affected are Genu of Corpus Callosum Left, Cingulum, Body of Corpus Callosum, Cerebral Peduncle and Anterior Corona Radiate. These results are consistent with the atlas based study on white matter done by X.Fan et.al 14. Another part of this study is to classify AD from NC by analyzing the characteristic changes in the diffusion indices of white matter using AdaBoost classifier. A 10-fold cross validation technique is used to arrive at the classifier performance for selected features obtained after applying GA. Figure 3 shows the variation of the classifier accuracy along the number of selected features. The maximum classification accuracy of 84.5 is achieved with 10 selected features. Classification accuracy considering all the features is 75.3. Classification accuracy considering only tree classifier without boosting hovered around 62.34, indicating that boosting mechanism aids in improving the classification accuracy by 20. The sensitivity and specificity of different approaches used are tabulated in Table 1. The reduction in the classification accuracy when all the features are considered is due to over fitting of the data by the classifier. Thus feature reduction aids in improving the classification accuracy by eliminating the redundant or less useful features from the dataset. These results also demonstrate that only 8-12 prominent features which describe the AD pathology most are sufficient for the auto diagnosis of AD. Furthermore, considering all the features for the classification reduces the diagnosis of AD. Other DTI indices namely Mean Diffusivity (MD) was also considered for this study however there was no substantial change in the classification accuracy by inclusion of MD along with FA. Thus FA parameter is sufficient enough to provide the classification of AD from NC. IV. CONCLUSION\nIn this study an attempt is made to identify the prominent regions in WM which gets affected most by AD, using GA feature reduction technique and AdaBoost classifier. With this approach it is possible to concentrate on the specific regions for feature extraction rather than considering entire WM. GA reduction techniques shows that Fornix region of WM is most affected due to AD. AdaBoost classifier was used for the auto diagnosis of the AD. Combination of GA and AdaBoost classifier along with diffusion indices feature, FA extracted from DTI images is able to classify AD and NC with the accuracy of 84.5. This approach when used for mass screening of AD reduces the memory and time complexity of the algorithm due to feature extraction from the specified regions. The findings in this study are consistent with the literature in identification of most affected regions in WM due to AD. Furthermore study can be carried out to find better feature reduction techniques and high end classifiers to improve the classification accuracy for diagnosis of Alzheimer.",

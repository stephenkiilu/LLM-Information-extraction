    "abstract": "Except for aging, carrying the APOE ε4 allele (APOE4) is the most important risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease. APOE4 carriers may have reduced capacity to recycle lipids, resulting in white matter microstructural abnormalities. In this study, we evaluated whether white matter impairment measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) differs between healthy individuals with a different number of APOE4 alleles, and whether white matter impairment associates with brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) load and serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL). We studied 96 participants (APOE33, N  37; APOE34, N  39; APOE44, N  20; mean age 70.7 (SD 5.22) years, 63 females) with a brain MRI including a DTI sequence (N  96), Aβ-PET (N  89) and a venous blood sample for the serum NfL concentration measurement (N  88). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in six a priori-selected white matter regions-ofinterest (ROIs) were compared between the groups using ANCOVA, with sex and age as covariates. A voxelweighted average of FA, MD, RD and AxD was calculated for each subject, and correlations with Aβ-PET and NfL levels were evaluated. APOE44 carriers exhibited a higher MD and a higher RD in the body of corpus callosum than APOE34 (p  0.0053 and p  0.0049, respectively) and APOE33 (p  0.026 and p  0.042). APOE44 carriers had a higher AxD than APOE34 (p  0.012) and APOE33 (p  0.040) in the right cingulum adjacent to cingulate cortex. In the total sample, composite MD, RD and AxD positively correlated with the cortical Aβ load (r  0.26 to 0.33, p  0.013 for all) and with serum NfL concentrations (r  0.31 to 0.36, p  0.0028 for all). In conclusion, increased local diffusivity was detected in cognitively unimpaired APOE44 homozygotes compared to APOE34 and APOE33 carriers, and increased diffusivity correlated with biomarkers of Alzheimers disease and neurodegeneration. White matter impairment seems to be an early phenomenon in the Alzheimers disease pathologic process in APOE44 homozygotes.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The ε4 allele for the APOE gene (APOE4) is the most important genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD) (Corder et al., 1993). The mechanism through which APOE4 increases the risk for AD has not yet been fully described, but the role of APOE4 in lipid dysregulation has been recently highlighted (Blanchard et al., 2022). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in lipid transport in the brain (Espeseth et al., 2012), and lipids are essential components of the myelin sheath that encircles axons. APOE4-induced cholesterol dysregulations may decrease synaptogenesis and myelination (Bartzokis, 2011;Blanchard et al., 2022), which could contribute to the formation of toxic aggregates characteristic of AD, including beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques (Lesser et al., 2011).\nWhite matter impairment is part of the pathophysiological changes that an individual experiences over the course of AD (Bronge et al., 2002;Ingelsson et al., 2004). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a wellestablished magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to quantify the movement of water molecules in the brain (Basser et al., 1994), which can detect early neurodegeneration in patients of AD (Palesi et al., 2018). The tensor model characterizes diffusion with six parameters: three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues (ODonnell and Westin, 2011). Fractional anisotropy (FA), a normalized variance of the eigenvalues (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;ODonnell and Westin, 2011), describes the shape of the diffusion ellipsoid at every voxel. Mean diffusivity (MD) represents total diffusion in a voxel as an average of the eigenvalues (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996). Measures of axial (AxD) and radial (RD) diffusivity describe diffusion along the axis of maximal apparent diffusion and its two orthogonal orientations in the perpendicular plane, respectively (ODonnell and Westin, 2011). White matter pathology often causes anisotropy to decrease, which may be concomitant with subtle changes in one, or more, of the diffusion directions (Alexander et al., 2007). DTI is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure; however, changes in FA, MD, RD and AxD should be interpreted with caution in healthy subjects (Jones et al., 2013).\nPrevious studies have consistently reported damage to white matter tracts in patients with AD (Bachman et al., 2014;Esrael et al., 2021;Gallagher et al., 2023;Lim et al., 2012;Palesi et al., 2018;Racine et al., 2014). These findings have been linked to other risk factors for AD, including the presence of at least one copy of the APOE4 allele (Bagepally et al., 2012;Lee et al., 2016). However, studies with healthy APOE4 carriers showed mixed results. Several DTI studies report degeneration of white matter tracts in healthy APOE4 carriers (Bagepally et al., 2012;Cai et al., 2017;Cavedo et al., 2017;Douaud et al., 2011;Dowell et al., 2013;Gold et al., 2010;Heise et al., 2014;Nierenberg et al., 2005;Persson et al., 2006), but other investigations have been unable to replicate these findings (Adluru et al., 2014;Honea et al., 2009;Lyall et al., 2020;Nyberg and Salami, 2014;ODwyer et al., 2012;Westlye et al., 2012). Notably, these changes already appear in the preclinical stages of AD (Gallagher et al., 2023).\nEven though previous studies have investigated the impact of APOE genotype on DTI metrics, the specific effects of APOE4 homozygosity in healthy subjects are rarely analyzed. As only 25 of the Caucasian population carries the APOE4 allele and prevalence of AD is elevated in this group (Gharbi-Meliani et al., 2021), it can be challenging to collect data from healthy elderly subjects who carry two copies of this allele. Most reports merge APOE34 and APOE44 when investigating the effects of APOE4 in the brain. However, since APOE44 carriers also have a higher risk of vascular factors that could affect white matter integrity, including increased LDL cholesterol levels (Lesser et al., 2011) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) (Lyall et al., 2020), the changes detected with DTI could be expected to be more severe.\nDuring recent years, it has also become possible to investigate neuronal degeneration with fluid-based biomarkers; however, little is known about the association between DTI metrics and blood biomarkers of axonal degeneration in at-risk populations. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein expressed in neurons, which associates with other proteins to form the cytoskeleton of axons. Neurofilaments can be released in large quantities after axonal injury or degeneration (Schultz et al., 2020) and are nowadays measurable from easily-obtained blood samples (Gaetani et al., 2019). Elevated levels of serum NfL correlate with decreased FA and increased MD, AxD and RD, in patients of multiple sclerosis (Saraste et al., 2021) and AD (Schultz et al., 2020). To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the relationship between serum NfL levels and DTI metrics in healthy APOE4 carriers.\nIn this study, we aimed to expand previous DTI results by i) comparing the DTI metrics of healthy elderly subjects with one, two, or no copies of the APOE4 allele and ii) exploring their association with brain Aβ load assessed by  11 CPiB positron emission tomography (PET) and with serum NfL concentrations in the whole cognitively unimpaired sample. We hypothesized that APOE4 carriers (APOE44 and APOE34) would present white matter microstructural abnormalities in a genedose dependent way when compared to APOE33 carriers. We expected that changes in tissue microstructure assessed by DTI would associate with higher levels of serum NfL and Aβ pathology measured by PET.",

      "text": "A total of one hundred and nine healthy elderly adults (mini mentalstate examination MMSE score  25, CERAD total score  62 (Chandler et al., 2005), between the ages of 65 and 85 years old) from ASIC-E4 (Snellman et al., 2022) and CIRI-5Y (Ekblad et al., 2018) studies were assessed for this investigation. Data from both cohorts were acquired at Turku PET Centre. The main exclusion criteria were cognitive decline, neurological or psychiatric diseases, or contraindications for MRI and PET imaging. Participants from ASIC-E4 were recruited and APOE genotyped in collaboration with Auria Biobank (Turku, Finland) following a protocol already published (Snellman et al., 2022). Participants from CIRI-5Y were recruited from the Health2000 study population and APOE genotyped using the MassARRAY System (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) (Ekblad et al., 2018) with an adapted previously published method (Jänis et al., 2004). Both studies were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland. All participants signed a written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\nSix subjects from the initial sample could not be included because they were missing DTI data with reversed phase-encoding polarities. After examining the DTI images, two subjects (APOE33) were excluded from analysis due to enlarged CSF spaces or incomplete head coverage. There were no subjects with APOE24 genotype, but five subjects had APOE23 genotype. Since DTI metrics of APOE23 carriers were seen to significantly differ from those of APOE33, the genotypes could not be pooled together as a non-carrier group. Furthermore, given the small sample size of APOE2 carriers (n  5), we lacked sufficient statistical power to reach generalizable conclusions about this group. Thus, the main analyses and results are reported with the remaining ninety-six participants (Group 1: APOE33, n  37; Group 2: APOE34, n  39; Group 3: APOE44, n  20). Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 respectively show demographic and regional DTI results including APOE23 carriers.\nOut of the ninety-six participants who were included in the main analyses (after the exclusion of APOE23 carriers), eighty-nine underwent PET imaging with the tracer  11 CPiB (one participant chose not to participate in PET imaging, two participants discontinued the study, one PET scan was interrupted and three participants could not visit the site of acquisition for this session) and blood samples were acquired for eighty-eight participants (six participants could not fast before venous blood sampling and two participants discontinued the study) (Fig. 1).",

Twenty-four MRI scans were acquired with Philips Ingenia 3.0 T systems with 20-channel dS head coil (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and the remaining seventy-two scans were acquired with Philips Ingenuity 3.0 T TF PET-MR with 32-channel head coil (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). In order to minimize possible confounding variation, the acquisition protocols were matched for both scanners. T1-weighted sequences, T2-weighted sequences, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and DTI sequences were acquired for each participant. MRI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist to exclude the presence of brain abnormalities.\nThe full imaging protocol has already been published (Snellman et al., 2022). DTI data were acquired using single-shot echo-planar imaging pulse sequences (TR  6700 ms, TE  120 ms, 2  2  2 mm voxels, 80 axial slices, slice thickness  2 mm, no slice gap, field of view  256  256 mm 2 , flip angle  90  ) with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) parallel imaging.

DTI sequences were followed by a single volume with b-value of 0, with the same acquisition parameters but opposing phase-encoding direction. A FLAIR image (TR  8000 ms, TE  337 ms, 1  1  1 mm voxels, field of view  256  256 mm 2 , flip angle  90  ) was used to estimate computed Fazekas score using an automatic cNeuroimage analysis tool (Combinostics Oy, Tampere, Finland), with an adapted version of methods previously described (Koikkalainen et al., 2016).",

Manual slice-by-slice visual inspection was carried out for all volumes using FSLEyes Lightbox to confirm the quality of image acquisition. DTI volumes were corrected for subject motion, susceptibility-and eddy-current-induced distortions using the FMRIB Software Library v6.0.1 (Smith et al., 2004). Correction for susceptibility distortion was implemented using an adapted version of the reverse gradient method (Andersson et al., 2003). Outlier replacement and intra-volume movement correction were applied simultaneously with eddy current correction for all subjects (Andersson et al., 2016;Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016). Non-brain tissue was removed using FSLs brain extraction tool (Smith, 2002). The threshold for the brain mask was individually adjusted after visual inspection. The diffusion tensor model (Basser et al., 1994) was fitted at each voxel to estimate the parameter maps for FA, MD, AxD and RD.\nThe ROIs were selected independently before conducting wholebrain analysis, to mitigate potential bias. The following six regions were chosen, based on previous literature researching the relationship between APOE gene and white matter microstructure (Adluru et al., 2014;Cai et al., 2017;Cavedo et al., 2017;Gold et al., 2010;Racine et al., 2014): uncinate fasciculus (UF), genu, body and splenium of corpus callosum (G-CC, B-CC, S-CC), cingulum bundle projections to hippocampus (C-HC) and cingulum bundle running adjacent to the cingulate gyrus (C-CG) (Supplementary Fig. 2). UF, C-HC and C-CG were analyzed separately between hemispheres after testing that DTI metrics significantly differed with paired-sample t-tests.\nParticipants FA, MD, AxD and RD maps were non-linearly transformed to MNI space using the FMRIB58_FA standard-space template as reference. FA maps were thresholded at 0.2 to correct for partial volume effects (PVEs). John Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 atlas (Mori et al., 2008) was used to extract a brain mask of the selected ROIs. These masks were resampled to align their dimensions with the subjects maps. Mean FA, MD, AxD and RD values were calculated by averaging the voxels within the boundaries of each ROI mask.\nWhole-brain analyses were carried out within the TBSS framework (Smith et al., 2006). A mean FA image was created and skeletonized using individual FA maps projected to the FMRIB58_FA template. The tract skeleton was thresholded at a value of FA  0.2. The non-linear warps obtained during FA image registration were subsequently applied to the MD, AxD and RD maps.",

      "text": "The main statistical analyses were performed using RStudio version 2022.12.0  353. For all numerical variables, normality was assessed with histograms, Shapiro-Wilk and Jarque-Bera tests. DTI metrics which did not fit the normal distribution were logarithmically transformed. Homoscedasticity was verified with Levenes test.\nCategorical demographic variables were compared between APOE3 3, APOE34 and APOE44 carriers with a χ 2 test. Numerical demographic variables were compared with an ANOVA if normally distributed and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used otherwise. Statistical significance was established at p  0.05 (two-sided). If significant differences were found, a Tukeys honest significant difference (HSD) or Dunns test were used to determine which specific groups differed significantly from each other. FA, MD, AxD and RD at each of the ROIs were compared between APOE33, APOE34 and APOE44 carriers with a one-way ANCOVA, with the age and sex being covariates of no interest. If a significant difference was found, Tukeys HSD was used to determine the direction of differences and Cohens d was used to assess the effect size. To test that our results were independent of i) the scanner used at the time of acquisition ii) WMHs, measured as a computed Fazekas score, and other lifestyle factors including iii) smoking, iv) diabetes and v) antihypertensive medications, we included these five variables as covariates in a second model.\nBy conducting ROI analysis, we aimed to quantify diffusion in a controlled number of regions relevant to the development of AD, based on a predefined hypothesis. Moreover, the main purpose of ASIC-E4 and CIRI-5Y cohorts was not to assess white matter microstructure, which makes this study exploratory in nature. This means it may lack sufficient statistical power to detect subtle differences, thus providing false negatives. For these reasons, following the guidelines of statistical theory (Rothman, 1990) and current research (Lyall et al., 2020;Svärd et al., 2017), uncorrected alpha  0.05 was considered nominally significant in our regional analyses. We additionally applied the false discovery rate (FDR) correction to our findings (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), but results are reported without correction for multiple comparisons unless stated otherwise.\nTo evaluate the association of DTI measures with serum NfL concentration and global Aβ deposition estimated by PiB-COMP, mean scores of FA, MD, AxD and RD were calculated by computing the voxelweighted average of our ROIs. Spearmans rank-order test was used to assess the correlation coefficient in the whole sample and stratified by their APOE status, which was considered significant at p  0.05. We examined possible interactions between APOE genotype and DTI on serum NfL and global Aβ with multiple linear regression, where APOE genotype and FA, MD, AxD or RD and the interaction term were added as predictors.\nVoxel-wise differences were assessed with the GLM design using the Randomise tool in FSL (Winkler et al., 2014). DTI metrics were compared between APOE33, APOE34 and APOE44 carriers using a one-way ANCOVA, including mean-centered age and sex as covariates of no interest. The number of permutations was set to 5000 based on the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (Smith and Nichols, 2009). Results were considered significant at p  0.05 with the family wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons. Clusters were labelled according to JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels atlas.",

A previous DTI study which included a small group of APOE44 carriers (n  10) did not report differences between APOE4 homo-and heterozygotes (Persson et al., 2006), but we expected that subtle differences would appear if we increased the sample size. Our findings in DTI analysis indicate that APOE44 carriers show local increases in diffusivity. These subjects already have high loads of Aβ in their brains (Snellman et al., 2023). Thus, these differences in white matter microstructure are unlikely to be due to age-related changes and might reflect white matter impairment.\nWe did not find the gene-dose effects we expected, because APOE34 and APOE33 carriers did not significantly differ from each other at a regional level. DTI scalars do not necessarily reflect white matter Note: a The p-value refers to overall difference among the groups.

Furthermore, APOE34 carriers who are still cognitively healthy at approximately 70 years probably have only very subtle AD-related changes in their brain. Differences in DTI scalar measures were not significant at wholebrain level when we compared the three APOE4 groups to each other (all FWE-corrected p  0.09); however, a few small, significant clusters appeared when we used a more liberal threshold (uncorrected p  0.001). APOE44 carriers showed increased MD compared to APOE34 and APOE33, and APOE34 exhibited a higher AxD than APOE33 (FWE-corrected p  0.05), thus aligning to our ROI analysis. TBSS was run after our primary analysis to confirm our findings. It is possible that the whole-brain ANCOVA did not reach a significant threshold because the ROI approach focused only on regions vulnerable to AD pathology, whereas analysis of large brain maps included the whole white matter skeleton.",

    "Methodological considerations": {
      "text": "We chose a set of ROIs (B-CC, G-CC, S-CC, LC-CG, RC-CG, LC-CH, RC-CH, RUF, LUF) aimed to specifically test the effects of early AD, since APOE4 carriers in a subset of our cohort already exhibited abnormalities in biomarkers of AD (Snellman et al., 2023;Koivumäki et al., 2023). We found significantly increased diffusivity in the cingulum and corpus callosum of APOE4 homozygotes. These regions connect the entorhinal cortex and the cerebral hemispheres, respectively, and they are fundamental for higher cognitive functions. Microstructural alterations in these tracts have been found in patients of AD (Esrael et al., 2021;Gallagher et al., 2023;Lim et al., 2012;Palesi et al., 2018), and already in healthy APOE4 heterozygotes (Adluru et al., 2014;Cai et al., 2017). We explored the tissue microstructure of these ROIs under the premise that white matter impairment might precede cognitive decline (Gallagher et al., 2023). In addition, damage to the fornix has been consistently reported in patients with dementia (Aggleton et al., 2016;Oishi and Lyketsos, 2014), so we initially selected this region for our study. Despite its relevance from the biological perspective, the fornix is susceptible to PVEs, given its proximity to cerebrospinal fluid (Oishi and Lyketsos, 2014;Rieckmann et al., 2016). Although FA is quantified between 0 and 1, FA values below 0.20 are unlikely to represent white matter tracts (Rieckmann et al., 2016;Smith et al., 2006). Of our subjects, 30.7 exhibited values of FA  0.2 in the fornix before thresholding, while FA was consistently higher in the remaining regions. Thus, the fornix was not included as ROI in our final analyses.\nIn our statistical analyses, we controlled for possible nuisance covariates, including age, sex, diabetes, smoking, anti-hypertensive medication, type of scanner used during acquisition and Fazekas scores. WMHs have been linked to cognitive decline and an increased risk for dementia (De Groot et al., 2001;Tubi et al., 2020). AD and the Fig. 3. Pairwise comparisons with TBSS (shown in black-red) projected over the mean FA skeleton (shown in green) and the FMRIB58_FA_1mm template at p  0.05, corrected for age and sex and controlling the family wise error rate with TFCE. APOE44 show a higher mean diffusivity than APOE34 in the internal capsule and a higher mean diffusivity than APOE33 carriers in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (A); APOE34 show a greater axial diffusivity than APOE33 in a cluster comprising part of the splenium of corpus callosum, left posterior thalamic radiation and left posterior corona radiata (B). Clusters have been filled with tbss fill in FSL, for visualization purposes. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) APOE4 allele have been previously associated with WMHs (Lyall et al., 2020;Palesi et al., 2018), although the Fazekas score did not significantly vary across APOE groups within our cohort. Our results remained significant when we adjusted our analyses for lifestyle factors, WMHs and type of scanner. Moreover, these variables did not improve the explanatory value of our models (adjusted R 2 increased on average 0.012), hence we decided to only include sex and age as covariates in our main results, to avoid overadjustment.\nThe effect sizes of our results were mostly small, but we found medium effects of APOE4 homozygosity in the body of corpus callosum (Cohens d  0.50). The regional differences in MD, RD and AxD were attenuated when we implemented FDR correction. As it has been previously noted (Cox et al., 2016;Lyall et al., 2020;Rothman, 1990), adjusting for type-1 error when analyzing brain MRI phenotypes might be overly cautious, and it is more reliable to test the replicability of findings with different cohorts.",

    "APOE2 allele and white matter microstructure": {
      "text": "The APOE2 allele is generally considered neuroprotective (Nagy et al., 1995), but its effects on white matter microstructure have rarely been investigated, and with inconsistent results (Chiang et al., 2012;Lyall et al., 2014). We expected the APOE2 allele to protect white matter tracts, but our exploratory supplemental findings that they show local increases in diffusivity. DTI scalar measures are affected by numerous factors. Our sample of APOE23 carriers was advanced in age and they may have developed non-AD related pathologies that influenced these results. However, since our APOE2 carrier group had only five subjects, we cannot provide conclusive insights on this topic.",

    "DTI and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration": {
      "text": "As our secondary objective, we aimed to expand current literature by relating our findings using DTI analysis with additional biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired at-risk individuals. We selected serum NfL as a biomarker of interest, since this biomarker reflects the intensity of axonal degeneration (Gaetani et al., 2019). Aβ load estimated by PET was chosen because APOE4 allele induces Aβ deposition (Husain et al., 2021) that could affect white matter integrity (Rieckmann et al., 2016).\nWe found no correlations between FA and serum NfL levels. Increased NfL concentrations were associated with increased diffusivity scores (MD, RD and AxD) in the whole sample, but not in APOE33 carriers, although these correlations were more prominent in subjects carrying only one APOE4 allele. The associations found in the present study highlight the value of DTI and serum NfL as biomarkers for axonal degeneration, confirming their potential to detect white matter impairment in subjects at genetic risk for AD. Aβ load directly correlated with MD, RD and AxD. APOE33 and APOE34 carriers in our cohort had lower Aβ load than APOE44, and they exhibited lower diffusivity. The relationship between Aβ and DTI differs across cohorts and regions (Racine et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2020), presumably due to model constraints (Douaud et al., 2011). Numerous studies have failed to link the APOE gene with early white matter impairment, thus supporting the idea that white matter abnormalities might be better explained by the pathology of AD than the APOE genotype. However, it is not possible to deduce from these findings whether Aβ affects white matter microstructure, or both increased diffusivity and Aβ load are a consequence of the pathology the brain experiences in AD.",

    "Strengths and limitations": {
      "text": "A major strength of this project is the recruitment of 20 healthy APOE44 carriers who underwent MRI, PET and had serum samples available. Thanks to the collaboration with Auria biobank during recruitment, it was possible to include sufficient APOE44 carriers to conduct a separate group analysis, therefore improving the statistical power.\nThis study also has several limitations. We used two scanners during image acquisition, with slightly different protocols, and uneven distributions among groups. This introduced an additional confound to our analyses, although it did not influence our results. The inability to accurately represent regions with crossing fibers is an inherent limitation of the DTI model. Brain regions including UF and C-HC, where we did not find significant group differences, show large orientation dispersion (Gallagher et al., 2023), which can indicate the presence of crossing fibers. Other limitations are related to our sample. Firstly, our study cohort did not include a sufficiently large proportion of APOE23 carriers to analyze these participants as a separate group. Secondly, the age range of our healthy APOE44 carriers was slightly younger when compared to the other groups. Elderly non-carriers might have developed other pathologies. The DTI findings did not correlate with AD biomarkers in the non-carrier group, which supports the theory that white matter degeneration is a sign of early AD in subjects at genetic risk for the disease, but not in non-APOE4 carriers.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "Our main finding was that healthy elderly APOE44 carriers showed significantly increased MD, RD and AxD compared to APOE34 and APOE33 carriers in regions vulnerable to AD. These indicators positively correlated with Aβ deposition and serum NfL levels in subjects who carried one or two APOE4 alleles. The reported effects are mild and should be verified by independent cohorts.\nThis study emphasizes the importance of studying the effects of APOE4 homozygosity and heterozygosity separately, by demonstrating significant differences in white matter microstructure between these groups and their association to other biomarkers for AD.",

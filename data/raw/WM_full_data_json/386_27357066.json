    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to brain microstructural changes. The aims of this DTI study were to map voxelwise the spatial distribution of brain microstructural changes in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and to investigate any correlation between DTI-derived indices and extension of T2 hyperintensity. METHODS: Eighteen patients with CADASIL and 18 age-, sex-, and education-level-matched healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Differences in DTI-derived indices (mean diffusivity MD, fractional anisotropy FA, axial AD and radial RD diffusivities, and mode of anisotropy MO) of brain white matter (WM) between CADASIL patients and healthy subjects were assessed through tract-based spatial statistics. Then, DTI-derived indices were correlated with the patients score on the extended Fazekas visual scale of the T2 hyperintensity. RESULTS: When compared to healthy controls, CADASIL patients showed extensive symmetric areas of increased MDRD and decreased ADFAMO that involved almost the entire hemispheric cerebral WM (internal and external capsule, WM of the temporal poles, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, forceps major and minor, corticospinal tracts, and thalamic radiations), thalami, and corpus callosum. Additional areas of increased RD were observed in pons, midbrain, cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellar WM. Only FA was negatively correlated with extended Fazekas visual score.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most frequent inherited brain small vessel disease (SVD). It is caused by missense mutations or, more rarely, deletions and insertions of NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19p13 that determines progressive degeneration of smooth muscle cells and deposits of granular osmiophilic material in the basal membrane of brain and systemic small arteries. 1 The most common clinical manifestations of CADASIL are migraine, transient ischemic attacks or strokes, psychiatric disorders, and progressive cognitive impairment in midage adults. 2 Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a leukoencephalopathy very similar to that observed in elderly hypertensive patients. 2 However, the areas of T2 hyperintensity usually appear before 35 years of age in CADASIL symptomatic or asymptomatic gene carriers.\nThey are initially localized in the periventricular cerebral white matter (WM) and centrum semiovale. Later, the distribution of T2 hyperintensity becomes peculiar with involvement of the WM of the external capsule, temporal poles, brainstem, and corpus callosum and of basal ganglia and thalamus. 2 Areas of T2 hyperintensity are combined with lacunar infarcts in about two-thirds of patients 3 and less frequently, with dilated perivascular spaces and microbleeds. 2 Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enable a sensitive quantitative assessment of the microstructural changes of the brain in patients with CADASIL. This involves both the WM exhibiting increased T2 signal and the normal appearing WM (NAWM) and the gray matter nuclei, namely, striatum and thalami. 456 In particular, using regions of interest (ROI) or histogram analyses, increase of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or of the mean Copyright  C 2016 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 1 diffusivity (MD) and decrease of the fractional anisotropy (FA) were observed in CADASIL as compared to healthy controls. Also, histogram measurements of diffusion indices were capable to detect progression of microstructural changes and were recommended for longitudinal studies. 789 Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is a reliable and optimized method to map voxelwise the distribution of the microstructural changes revealed by DTI in the WM of whole brain. 10,11 It has been employed to investigate leukoencephalopathy due to SVD in elderly subjects, 121314 but to our knowledge, it has not been used in patients with CADASIL.\nIn this study, we aimed to use TBSS to map voxelwise the spatial distribution of brain microstructural change revealed by DTI-derived indices in patients with CADASIL. Also, we investigated any correlation between DTI-derived indices and extension of T2 hyperintensity.",

      "text": "In this prospective study, a complete MRI protocol was performed in 21 symptomatic patients with genetically proven CADASIL regularly followed at the VAS-COG clinic of the Stroke Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy. The same MRI protocol had been previously performed in 24 normal subjects without history of neurologic or psychiatric disease and with a normal neurological examination who were selected as potential controls for this study. A preliminary analysis of demographic data showed that the two groups were different with regard to age, gender, and education level. Because of the small sample size, an analysis adjusted for demographic variables was not correctly applicable. Thus, considering the demographic characteristics of CADASIL sample, we applied the propensity score method to create two groups, matched for age, sex, and educational level. The two groups created with this method were composed of 20 CADASIL patients and 20 controls. Propensity score matching was obtained by means of PSMATCHING3 extension of R in SPSS20 with algorithm Nearest Neighbor. 15 Two CADASIL patients (and hence the two corresponding control subjects) were not included in the final sample because of technical problems with DTI.\nThe final samples of patients and controls were composed by 18 patients with CADASIL (7 mean and 11 women, mean age 42.9  11.1 years mean  standard deviation, range 23-61 years) and 18 healthy subjects (10 men and 8 women, mean age 41.2  10.1 years, range 25-66 years).\nPatients and controls have signed a written informed consent to undergo a dedicated MRI study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by local ethics committees.",

WM T2 hyperintensities on FLAIR images were graded according to the extended (0-6 score) modified Fazekas scale. 16 Periventricular hyperintensities scores are as follows: 0  absence, 1  caps or pencil-thin lining, 2  smooth halo, and 3  irregular periventricular hyperintensities extending into the deep WM. Deep WM hyperintense signals scores are as follows: 0  absence, 1  punctuate foci, 2  beginning confluence of foci, and 3  large confluent areas. Periventricular and deep WM hyperintensities are rated separately. A total score is obtainable by summing the two partial scores. Moreover, he was requested to report separately for the right and left cerebral hemispheres.\nLacunar infarcts visible on MRI were defined as markedly hypointense (CSF-like) lesions on T1-weighted imaging with corresponding hypointense centrum and hyperintense rim on FLAIR images with a diameter  20 mm.

      "text": "Voxelwise statistical analysis of FA, MD, AD, RD, and MO maps was carried out using TBSS, 10 part of FSL. All subjects FA data were normalized to a common space (ie, the best representative subject obtained by nonlinearly normalizing every FA image to every other one) employing the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (FMRIBs nonlinear image registration tool, 22,23 which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field). 24 Then, the mean FA image was created and thinned (FA  0.35) to create a mean FA skeleton that represents the centers of all tracts common to all subjects. This was accomplished using an FA minimum threshold of .35, higher than the default value (.2) in order to more likely exclude all (cortical and deep) gray matter in data analysis. Each subjects aligned FA data were projected onto this skeleton, and then aligned into the MNI space through an affine transformation. MD, AD, RD, and MO maps were normalized and aligned into the MNI space by applying the same transformation used for FA maps. Finally, MDADRDFAMO maps were fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistics, using general linear models (GLMs) and permutation-based (5,000 permutations) nonparametric inference (randomize, also part of FSL).\nWe investigated the effect of group (CADASIL vs. controls) through a first GLM. In particular, given that patients and controls were age-, gender-, and educational-level-matched, no nuisance covariates were included in the model. In addition, a within-group analysis in the CADASIL patients group has been performed in order to test for significant correlation between DTI-derived indices and visual score of T2 hyperintensity. 25 In this regard, a specific GLM has been designed for each DTIderived index, including age and gender as nuisance covariates. P values were calculated and corrected for multiple comparisons with 2-dimensional threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), thereby avoiding the use of an arbitrary threshold for the initial cluster formation. 26 For diffusion metrics whose significance maps suggested a potential side asymmetry in the diffusion changes, we also tested the skeleton voxels on the left of the brain versus those on the right (ie, testing for side asymmetries in diffusion characteristics) using the tbss sym FSLs script. The tbss sym analysis has been performed using TFCE at a significance level of P  .05 and testing for both leftright and rightleft. A P-value  .05 corrected for multiple comparisons was considered statistically significant.\nThe WM tracts in which significant between group differences and intragroup correlations were detected were labeled using the Balboni et als anatomy textbook 27 showing in green areas of significantly increased radial diffusivity in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy as compared to healthy controls. These include the cerebral white matter (WM) (internal and external capsule, WM of the temporal poles, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, forceps major and minor, corticospinal tracts, and thalamic radiations), the thalami, and the corpus callosum. Also, the midbrain and pons and the bilateral superior and middle and left inferior cerebellar peduncles and bilateral cerebellar WM are involved.

      "text": "Clinical features, visual score, and number of lacunar infarcts in the CADASIL patients are summarized in Table 1. Most of our CADASIL patients were early symptomatic or with mild disease severity. In 2 of 18 CADASIL patients, some side difference in visual rating was observed, whereas the rating was symmetric in the remainder. In particular, while periventricular WM was always symmetric, 1 patient presented leftright deep WM evaluation of 12 and the other 21.\nBetween-group analysis revealed that, when compared to controls, CADASIL patients showed extensive almost symmetric areas of significantly increased RD ( In particular, these areas included internal and external capsule, WM of the temporal poles, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, forceps major and minor, corticospinal tracts, and thalamic radiations. Additional areas of significantly increased RD were present in midbrain, pons, bilateral superior, and middle and left inferior cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar WM.\nAreas of significantly decreased MO involved the cerebral WM in the left parietal lobe and left cingulated gyrus (Fig 5). The MO changes failed to reach statistical significance at the TBSS testing for side asymmetry in diffusion characteristics.\nWithin-group analysis in CADASIL group revealed that FA (Fig 6) was significantly negatively correlated with Fazekasextended visual scale. The areas of decreased FA correlated with increasing visual scale involved frontal WM (bilaterally), left thalamus and internal capsule, left external capsule, corona radiata (bilaterally), left centrum semiovale, and left anterior corpus callosum. This apparent partial lateralization of results failed to reach statistical significance at the TBSS testing for side asymmetry in diffusion characteristics.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "CADASIL is a model of SVD associated with cerebral T2 hyperintensity including the most common age-related type. 2 Neuropathological examination of the brain in CADASIL identifies three types of alterations affecting the WM, gray matter showing in red areas of significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy as compared to healthy controls. These include the cerebral white matter (WM)(internal and external capsule, WM of the temporal poles, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, forceps major and minor, corticospinal tracts, and thalamic radiations), the thalami, and the corpus callosum. The TBSS_fill script was used to thicken significant regions and improving the visualization of the results. The skeleton mask is shown using the pink color.\n(GM), and the small vessel. 29303132 Macroscopic examination of the brain shows diffuse myelin pallor and rarefaction of the hemispheric WM predominating in periventricular areas and centrum semiovale but also involving the corpus callosum, midbrain, and pons. The U-fibers are partially preserved, whereas brainstem longitudinal tracts can show pallor. Lacunar infarcts and microhemorrhages are scattered in WM and basal ganglia; Virchow-Robin spaces are usually dilated. The microscopic examination shows demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis in the WM. A postmortem MRI pathological correlation study at 7 T has demonstrated that the cerebral cortex shows widespread neuronal apoptosis grossly proportional to the extent and severity of underlying WM changes and tiny cortical infarcts that are missed by in vivo MRI. 29 The small penetrating cerebral and leptomeningeal arteries show specific changes, namely, thickening and fibrosis of the arterial wall with lumen stenosis but not occlusion, a largely normal endothelium, the presence of an extracellular deposition within the media extending to the adventitia of nonamyloid granular osmiophilic material, which is a specific ultrastructural feature of the disease, and prominent morphological alterations and eventual disappearance of smooth-muscle cells. ROI and histogram analyses of DWI and DTI, which have been employed in previous diffusion-MRI studies of CADASIL, 456789 are characterized by intrinsic limitations. For instance, ROI analysis is biased by a priori selection of a limited number of regions under study, and may suffer from not negligible intra-and interoperator variability when ROIs are manually placed. 5,6 Histogram analysis of the whole or segmented brain is characterized by a loss of anatomicalregional information. On the other hand, TBSS enables an automatic whole brain and unbiased voxelwise analysis of WM tracts.\nAs a matter of fact, whole brain DTI supplemented by TBSS has the potential to provide a complete nondestructive picture of the distribution of brain damage in CADASIL. Accordingly, the present study reveals that as compared to a group of healthy controls, patients with CADASIL show widespread significant changes of the DTI-derived indices in WM tracts. This in line with the observation in a single case of CADASIL examined with tractography. 33 The results of this between group analysis in consideration of the above neuropathological descriptions 29303132 justifies the assumption that the DTI changes we observed correspond to the microstructural damage in CADASIL. 34 In addition, our TBSS study confirms some peculiarity of the distribution of brain microstructural damage in CADASIL including involvement of the temporal pole, external capsule, brainstem, and cerebellar WM and thalamus that can exhibit T2 hyperintensity especially in advanced cases. 2 Overall, the distribution of DTI-derived indices changes involved WM tracts belonging to three systems, namely, the cerebral WM (intrahemispheric cerebral connections), the corpus callosum (interhemispheric cerebral connections), and the dentate-rubro-thalamic-cerebral tracts (cerebrocerebellar and cerebellocerebral connections).\nIn our study, regions of decreased FA were correlated with extension of T2 hyperintensity. This is in line with the hypothesis that DTI-derived indices might serve as biomarkers of increasing severity of microstructural damage. 35 We recognize the following limitations of our study. First, ours is small size cross-sectional study. Second, we did not address correlation with quantitative assessment of clinical features and neuropsychological deficits. However, this was beyond the aim of the present investigation because of the small sample size and of the necessity to consider for such a correlation additional MRI markers reflecting the entire spectrum of the neuropathological changes of CADASIL.",

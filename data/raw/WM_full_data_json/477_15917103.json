    "abstract": "Different processes like microvascular dysfunction, free radical toxicity, -amyloid deposits, and Wallerian degeneration can cause functionally relevant disturbances of cerebral neuronal networks by myelin degeneration. Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging (ccDTI) allows the structural identification and quantification of myelinated fiber tracts. Particularly, posterior cingulate fiber tracts, which are regarded as important neuronal substrates of the network representing memory processing can be localized only imprecisely by conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The posterior cingulate bundles were assessed by ccDTI in 17 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 patients with Alzheimers dementia (DAT), and 21 age-matched controls. Additionally, DTI values were correlated with memory performance in the delayed verbal recall test. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differed significantly between MCI and controls, as well as between DAT and controls. Performance in the delayed verbal recall test of the entire study group correlated significantly with posterior cingulate bundle anisotropy and diffusivity. Using ccDTI seems, hence, a favorable strategy to detect and quantify the structural integrity of posterior cingulate white matter in MCI. Alterations of DTI parameters substantiate the involvement of white matter pathology in the development of MCI. Moreover, ccDTI could serve as in vivo method to investigate age and disease-related myelin alterations as potential morphological substrates of cognitive dysfunction.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Episodic memory impairment is the core symptom of the amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which represents a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia of Alzheimers type (DAT) in many patients 19,24,25.\nThe posterior cingulate is an important part of the Papez-circuit, which subsumes necessary neural substrates of episodic memory. Cingulum fibers connect the anterior thalamus, the cortical cingulum, the association cortices, and the hippocampus.\nIsolated lesion studies of the posterior cingulum showed relatively mild memory deficits in rats and monkeys 20,23. In human functional imaging studies activation of the posterior cingulate cortex seems to be associated with retrieval of autobiographical or grief related episodic memory 9,16. In DAT and MCI patients reduction of the posterior cingulate glucose metabolism has turned out to be one of the most sensitive and specific findings for early diagnosis of AD 11,18,26.\nDespite this striking relevance of posterior cingulate glucose metabolism for early diagnosis of AD, structural imaging has shown early damage of brain tissue mainly in mesial temporal structures, especially entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 6,7,31, whereas the cingulate region was found to be relatively unimpaired in these early stages of AD 5,11 when using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.\nDiffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) measures the random translational motion of water molecules. In structured tissues such like myelin fibers this motion is restricted. The relative preference of the diffusion in fiber direction is called anisotropy. The degree of anisotropy is given as fractional anisotropy (FA) and can be calculated from the eigenvalues of the diffusion-tensor, which is used as a measure for white matter integrity. Mean diffusivity (MD) is a measure for randomized mean water diffusion. It can be used as a measure of alterations of brain tissues 14,28.\nIn AD patients, white matter structural changes could be demonstrated in several DTI studies 3,10,27,32. In a comparative study of MCI patients and healthy control subjects, an elevation of hippocampal diffusivity has been found 12. Investigating MCI patients with DTI we could recently demonstrate ultrastructural brain tissue alterations in the hippocampus and cerebral white matter regions that are typically involved in early AD 8.\nConventional MRI uses different kinds of contrasting mechanisms like T1 or T2 based on relaxation parameters of water molecules. These procedures can reliably distinguish different brain structures like gray matter structures, white matter, and ventricles. The exact visualization of specific white matter tracts like the cingulate fasciculus has not proved satisfactory using conventional MRI techniques. Detection of the cingulate fasciculus depends on determination of its definite direction in space, i.e. by differentiation from adjacent white matter structures of the corpus callosum. Based on color maps that represent the orientation of anisotropic tissues like neuron fiber tracts the exact fiber orientation of the cingulum bundle can be easily detected by ccDTI technique.\nBased on the hypothesis that posterior cingulate glucose hypometabolism in early AD corresponds with at least posterior cingulate connectivity disturbances, we detected the posterior cingulum bundle with ccDTI and calculated FA and MD values of this region in MCI patients. These data were compared with age-matched normal controls and patients with DAT. Additionally, we correlated posterior cingulum FA and MD values with memory performance.",

      "text": "We enrolled 17 patients with MCI (11 male, 6 female; age 67.5  8.9 years), 25 patients with DAT (5 male, 20 female; age 69.5  7.7 years) who consulted the University Memory Clinic for diagnostic evaluation of memory complaints, and 21 healthy age-matched controls (13 male, 8 female; age 67.7  8.5 years) in this prospective study. MCI was defined according to Petersen et al. 24,25. All dementia patients fulfilled the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Di-agnostic procedures comprised clinical psychiatric and neurological examinations and laboratory tests including Vitamin B 12 , folate and thyroid hormones. Neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Mini Mental State Examination and delayed verbal recall test of the German version of the consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) battery 30. Particularly, the results of the delayed verbal recall test will be used for correlation analyses with DTI parameters, as this test of memory function has proven sensitivity and specificity for detecting early stages of DAT, including MCI 13,15,29. Furthermore, posterior cingulate structures are known to be involved in episodic memory processing 4.\nPatients with metabolic diseases that could interfere with cognitive functioning and patients with other brain diseases or pathological brain scan findings including significant cerebrovascular diseases (cortical infarctions, multiple lacunar lesions) were excluded as well as patients with a diagnosis of present depression or dysthymia according to DSM-IV criteria. Control persons were recruited by advertisement and underwent a structured interview to exclude persons with complaints about cognitive functioning, substance abuse, depression, and symptoms of any cerebral diseases in the history. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent.",

      "text": "From the DTI data, MD was calculated off-line on a workstation (Sun-Microsystem, Santa Clara, CA) with PV-Wave software Version 7.5 (Visual Numerics, San Ramon, USA) from the mean eigenvalues of the diffusion-tensor (D xx  D yy  D zz )3 given in mm 2 s and FA as standard deviation of eigenvalues from the mean eigenvalue normalized by square norm of eigenvalues 2. Both indices were plotted voxel by voxel as MD and FA index maps.\nColor maps were computed using the absolute values of the X, Y and Z components from the main eigenvector from a given diffusion-tensor as the Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) components of an R G B encoded color value with their intensities given by the FA of the voxel. In axial slices, green was assigned to an anterior-posterior, red to a left-right and blue to a cranio-caudal direction 22.\nIn order to place the Regions of Interest (ROIs) into the posterior part of the cingulum, we displayed the color maps simultaneously with MD-and FA-maps. In this way, the cingulum could be identified and differentiated from the callosal radiation (Fig. 1). To place the rectangular ROIs and to determine regional index values we used the software Image-J version 1.30v (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA). ROIs were placed individually for each patient and control subject in the posterior part of the posterior cingulate fiber tracts. To obtain standardized conditions for analysis and to avoid contamination of the data by adjacent structures (e.g. CSF or corpus callosum fibers) the largest ROI size (3  4 pixels) that did not extend in any case beyond the color-coded area of the posterior cingulate fibers was applied.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "Patients and controls are characterized in Table 1. There where no significant age differences between the three groups. Gender differed substantially only between DAT patients and controls. Mean FA and MD values are given in Table 2.\nMCI patients showed a significant decrease of mean FA value of the left posterior cingulum bundle (p  0.004), and MD values were significantly elevated at the left side (p  0.045; right side: p  0.14) in MCI patients compared to normal controls. Though MCI patients had higher mean FA values and lower mean MD values compared to DAT patients the differences did not reach statistical significance (p  0.05).\nThe maximum group differences of FA and MD values could be found between DAT patients and normal controls. In DAT patients FA values were decreased bilaterally compared to normal controls (left side: p  0.0001; right side: p  0.001); MD values showed significant elevations in this group compared to controls (p for both sides  0.004).\nDelayed verbal recall test results, i.e. the number of recalled words, of the entire study group (n  63) correlated significantly with FA and MD values of the posterior cingulate bundles (Fig. 2). Lower FA values of both sides were significantly related to decreased memory performance (left: r s  0.37, p  0.003; right: r s  0.33, p  0.009). Correspondingly, higher MD of both sides were associated with significantly lower performance in the delayed verbal recall test (left: r s  -0.35, p  0.005; right: r s  -0.30, p  0.018).\nNeither FA nor MD values yielded significant correlations with age (r s  0.20, p  0.10). Additionally, when correlations between FA or MD values and memory performance were statistically controlled for age (partial correlations), the results remained rather unchanged.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This is the first study that investigated cingulum bundle integrity in MCI patients using ccDTI technique. ccDTI provides the determination of fiber tracts via visualizing the orientation of anisotropic tissues and, therefore, it is a highly reliable tool for investigation of the cingulate fasciculus. However, the accuracy of the method is somehow limited by the relatively low resolution of the color maps as well as the application limitations of the ROI placement procedure.\nUsing DTI we provided first evidence of functionally relevant white matter alterations in MCI 8 patients recently. These disturbances have been assumed to be etiologically heterogeneous, e.g. due to Wallerian degeneration, -amyloid deposits, or microvascular dysfunction.\nHowever, the posterior cingulate bundle has not been investigated so far mostly due to technical restrictions. As shown in the present report, the properties of the ccDTI technique make the localization and quantification of the posterior cingulate bundles now possible.\nThe most notable finding of our study was the significant decrease of the posterior cingulate fasciculus anisotropy of MCI patients measured as FA values. Processes that lead to disturbances of white matter homogeneity can be expressed by decreased FA values indicating violation of white matter integrity in the brain.\nCorresponding to this finding we could measure a significant increment of the diffusivity detected by MD measurement at least in the left cingulum bundle of MCI patients. During neurodegeneration cell loss leads to increased diffusion of water molecules that can be quantified by elevated MD values. Thus, for the first time our study clearly demonstrates disturbed integrity in the region of the posterior cingulum bundles of MCI patients. On the neuropsychological level posterior cingulate bundle disconnectivity is reflected by the significant correlation of episodic memory performance and DTI parameters. This finding underscores the validity of our DTI findings and corroborates previous findings regarding the importance of the posterior cingulate bundles for episodic memory function 4,5,9.\nVarious neurodegenerative disease and age-related mechanisms are assumed to impair the connectivity of the neuronal network underlying memory function. Beside primary cortical neuron degeneration some processes like microvascular dysfunction, free radical toxicity, and -amyloid deposits can cause disturbances of the cognitive networks by slowly progressing myelin-degeneration 1,21. As our results strongly suggest, such functionally relevant white matter impairment can be sensitively detected and quantified by DTI. Due to the homogenous study groups concerning age a significant influence of age on either DTI parameters or memory performance could not be found in the present investigation.\nMoving to AD patients anisotropy and diffusivity were even more severely impaired. This finding was expected and fits to the more severely impaired cognitive functioning and the advanced neurodegenerative process of this group. However, FA and MD values of AD patients did not differ significantly from those of MCI patients suggesting a more close relation of diffusion characteristics between the studied amnestic MCI patients who were clinically and neuropsychologically clearly affected (mean MMSE 25.3) and AD compared to MCI and normal controls.\nAlthough there is evidence of posterior cingulate dysfunction in MCI and AD, structural correlates and their neurobiological as well as neuropsychological and clinical implications have not been clarified yet. Chetelat et al. 5 described posterior cingulate glucose hypometabolism together with unimpaired posterior cingulate grey matter density, detected with high resolution T1-weighted MRI in MCI patients. This dissociation of structural and functional findings in the area of the posterior cingulate was interpreted as a consequence of disturbed connectivity of hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. Our findings fit to these results insofar as we could provide evidence of connectivity disturbances in the posterior cingulate bundles. Focusing on the suspected dissociation of functional and structural imaging of the posterior cingulate our results suggest at least coexistent ultrastructural and subtle functional disturbances in MCI patients.\nMiller et al. 17 have recently found posterior cingulate grey matter loss in MCI patients using labeled cortical mantle distance maps thus providing evidence of structural alterations of the posterior cingulate in MCI patients.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "ccDTI is a favorable tool to reveal the loss of integrity of the posterior cingulate bundles in MCI patients. Thus, our results provide further evidence that white matter pathology seems to contribute to the development of MCI. Furthermore, alterations of the posterior cingulate fascicles were associated with episodic memory impairment.\nBecause of the eminent diagnostic value of this region for early diagnosis of AD with functional imaging and the lack of susceptibility artifacts compared to medial temporal regions, ccDTI could serve as diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of AD.\nAdditionally, ccDTI could provide more precise information of the neural substrates underlying cognitive functioning. The technique could help reveal the involvement of functionally relevant white matter degeneration in normal aging and neurodegeneration. In this regard our findings propose ccDTI as promising method to bridge a gap between functional and structural imaging. The study is limited by the relatively low number of patients. Further investigations including longitudinal assessments of MCI patients have to be conducted.",

    "abstract": "Rationale and Objectives: The role of MR imaging in patients with cognitive impairment is to evaluate each component of Alzheimers disease (AD), small vessel disease (SVD), and glymphatic function. We want to validate the diagnostic performance of the comprehensive interpretation of these parameters to predict the cognitive impairment stage. Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 359 patients with cognitive impairment who had undergone MRI (FLAIR, T2WI, 3D-T1WI, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging DTI) and a neuropsychological screening battery between January 2020 and July 2022. Each AD and SVD-related MR parameter was visually evaluated, and DTI analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index was calculated. Volumetry analysis was performed using Neurophet AQUA AI-based software. Using logistic regression analysis, four types of models were developed and compared by adding the components in the following order: (1) clinical factors and AD, (2) SVD, (3) glymphatic function-related MR parameters, and (4) volumetric data. Chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm was used to develop diagnostic tree analysis (DTA) model to predict late-stage cognitive impairment. Results: APOE4 status, years of education, medial temporal lobe atrophy score, Fazekas scale score, DTI-ALPS index, and white matter hyperintensity were significant predictors of late-stage cognitive impairment. The performance of the prediction model increased from Model 1 to Model 4 (AUC: 0.880, 0.899, 0.914, and 0.945, respectively). The overall accuracy of the DTA model was 87.47. Conclusion: Integrative brain MRI assessments in patients with cognitive impairment, AD, SVD, and glymphatic function-related MR parameters, improve the prediction of late-stage cognitive impairment.",

      "text": "ementia is an umbrella term for the loss of cognitive functions, including memory, perception, attention, or language, to an extent that is severe enough to interfere with daily life (1)(2)(3). More than 50 diseases have been reported to cause dementia, with approximately 80 attributed to Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (3)(4)(5)(6). In adult-onset slowly progressive dementia, mixed-type dementia is more prevalent than single-cause dementia, with the majority consisting of AD and small vessel disease (SVD), which adversely affect cognitive function for a particular portion (6)(7)(8)(9). Therefore, the degree of hippocampal atrophy and SVD-related MR parameters (white matter hyperintensity, lacunes, microbleeds, perivascular spaces, and brain atrophy) have been reported in patients with cognitive impairment who had undergone brain MRI (4). However, there are still no guidelines or recommendations on how to integrate the information from each parameter and suggest the expected degree of cognitive impairment on MRI.\nRecently, the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis aLong the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index has garnered attention as a non-enhancing imaging method for assessing glymphatic function (10)(11)(12). Until a few years ago, the role of MRI was restricted to (1) detecting other causes of cognitive impairment such as subdural hematoma or tumors and (2) evaluating the neurodegeneration aspect in the ATN (A: Aβ level; T: Tau level; N: Neurodegeneration) research framework (3,(13)(14)(15). However, recent advancements allow the indirect assessment of A and T through the glymphatic MR imaging because primary function of the glymphatic flow is to remove metabolic waste products, such as amyloid beta or tau (16)(17)(18)(19). Theoretically, glymphatic function can even evaluate the pre-A stage and predict whether the ATN cascade will proceed.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a correlation between AD-related MR parameters and the ALPS-index (20)(21)(22). More recently, researchers have also identified a relationship between small vessel disease (SVD)-related MRI parameters and the ALPS-index (23,24). A 2024 study explored the interrelationships among AD, SVD, and glymphatic function-related MRI parameters; however, the study did not include integrative interpretation of the findings (25). Our study aimed to evaluate how the diagnostic performance of MRI can be enhanced in predicting the cognitive impairment stage by incorporating SVD and glymphatic functionrelated parameters with AD-related parameters. Additionally, we tried to develop an intuitive Diagnostic Tree Analysis (DTA) model to predict late-stage cognitive impairment by integrating information regarding AD, SVD, and glymphatic function-related MR parameters.",

    "Cognitive Impairment and Small Vessel Disease": {
      "text": "In our study, among the five components of small vessel disease, white matter hyperintensity and brain atrophy were significant predictors of the degree of cognitive impairment. The pathophysiology of SVD is endothelial dysfunction, wherein leaked plasma components, such as complement or fibrinogen, inflict damage on the perforating arteries and brain parenchyma (28)(29)(30). This direct damage and subsequent dysfunction of neurovascular coupling lead to both complete and incomplete ischemic changes. In the early phases, these processes manifest as white matter AUC, area under the curve; CI, confidence interval; DTI-ALPS, Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis aLong the Perivascular Space; GM, gray matter; ICV, intracranial volume; MTL, medial temporal lobe; NPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; WMH, white matter hyperintensity hyperintensities (WMHs), followed by diffuse brain atrophy (4). Reduced global network connectivity and network efficiency within relatively extensive WMH areas may be closely associated with cognitive impairment (30). Although lacunes resulting from complete infarction and microbleeds due to endothelial damage may affect the neural network, their relatively small volume burden may render them as insignificant factors in cognitive impairment.",

    "Cognitive Impairment and Glymphatic Function": {
      "text": "In the present study, the DTI-ALPS index was found to be a significant predictor of the degree of cognitive impairment. When this parameter is added to the model, its performance improves significantly. These findings were consistent with those of several prior studies (21,(31)(32)(33)(34). Considering the pivotal role of glymphatic flow in clearing not only Aβ and tau but also leaked plasma component which is the primary toxin in SVD (7), it is plausible to include glymphatic imaging in the protocol for cognitive impairment. Although MRI after intrathecal contrast injection is the most direct method for evaluating glymphatic function (12,35), its widespread use is restricted owing to its invasiveness. A sequential brain MRI (more than five times over 24 h) after intravenous contrast injection is hard to be applied in general clinical settings by its inconvenience (36). The DTI-ALPS index is easy to calculate after a quick, contrast-free DTI scan, taking under 6 min and compatible with most standard MRI machines (37,38). Given its notable advantages and minimal drawbacks, DTI is considered an essential sequence for assessing cognitive impairment.",

In this study, we observed an enhancement in the model performance upon the inclusion of volumetric parameters, as indicated by an increase in the AUC from 0.914 to 0.945 and in the overall accuracy from 84.96 to 86.63. Consequently, using volumetric software, particularly for WMH volume data, is meaningful when available. Nevertheless, the diagnostic performance of the DTA model remained relatively good even without volumetric data (overall accuracy  87.47). This suggests that even at institutions lacking access to volumetric software, valuable information can still be effectively communicated to clinicians through simple visual scoring and integrated reports of these parameters.",

    "Clinical Implications of an Integrative Model for Interpreting Cognitive Impairment in Brain MRI": {
      "text": "Our integrative model for patients with cognitive impairment has several clinical implications. First, the model simplifies the interpretation of brain MRI results, which now include glymphatic function, volumetric data, and AD-and SVD-related parameters. By summarizing the degree of cognitive impairment, clinicians can quickly understand MRI implications. Second, the model helps determine the need for further work-up. Initial assessments using MMSE and brain MRI can lead to more specific tests such as comprehensive neuropsychiatric batteries, APOE genetic testing, or amyloid PET-CT if late-stage impairment is indicated. Third, the model can guide treatment options. For early-stage impairment, cognitive rehabilitation or lifestyle changes are recommended. If late MCI or dementia is suspected, medications such as Aβ monoclonal antibodies (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab), cholinesterase inhibitors, or NMDA receptor antagonists may be considered. Referrals to higher-level care centers may be necessary for diseasemodifying medication.",

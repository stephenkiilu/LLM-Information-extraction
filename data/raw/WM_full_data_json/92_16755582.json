    "abstract": "Atrophy of cortical and subcortical gray matter is apparent in Huntingtons disease (HD) before symptoms manifest. We hypothesized that the white matter (WM) connecting cortical and subcortical regions must also be affected early and that select clinical symptoms were related to systems degeneration. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to examine the regional nature of WM abnormalities in early HD, including the preclinical period, and to determine whether regional changes correlated with clinical features. We studied individuals in early stages (HD), presymptomatic individuals known to carry the genetic mutation that causes HD (Pre-HD), and matched healthy controls. DTI indices of tissue integrity were obtained from several regions of interest, including the corpus callosum (CC), internal capsule (IC), and basal ganglia, were compared across groups by t tests, and were correlated to cognitive and clinical measures. WM alterations were found throughout the CC, in the anterior and posterior limbs of the IC, and in frontal subcortical WM in HD subjects, supporting the selective involvement of the pyramidal tracts in HD; a similar distribution of changes was seen in Pre-HD subjects, supporting presymptomatic alterations. There was a significant relationship between select DTI measures and cognitive performance. Alterations in diffusion indices were also seen in the striatum that were independent of atrophy. Our findings support that WM alterations occur very early in HD. The distribution of the changes suggests that these changes contribute to the disruption of pyramidal and extrapyramidal circuits and also support a role of compromised cortical circuitry in early cognitive and subtle motor impairment during the preclinical stages of HD.",

      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by the abnormal repeating expansion of a trinucleotide sequence in the coding region of the IT15 gene on chromosome 4. 1 The disease is characterized clinically by involuntary movements, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. Neuropathologic studies show selective degeneration of vulnerable populations of neurons with a predilection for degeneration of the striatum. 2 Recent studies suggest that brain degeneration extends well beyond the striatum in HD, involving both cortical and subcortical brain regions. Involvement of the cerebral cortex has been of particular interest because huntingtin protein aggregates concentrate in cortical neurons 2,3 more so than in the striatum. The cerebral cortex atrophies in early HD. 4,5 Additionally, cortical alterations have been hypothesized to contribute to striatal degeneration through dysregulation of glutamate and neurotrophin containing afferent projections. Subcortical white matter (WM) degeneration is apparent in advanced HD, 6,7 but the timing of its development and regional patterns have not been characterized, especially in early stages of disease.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method that has been used to measure alterations in tissue composition in a variety of neurological diseases. Quantitative DTI measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), provide information about WM integrity 8 but have also been used to examine tissue fiber architecture within gray matter. 9 The DTI signals are indices of brain water diffusion; the biophysical basis of diffusion measures include underlying fiber architecture, fiber density, uniformity of nerve fiber direction, 9 and axonal membranes and cytoskeleton. 8 Because such tissue features are disrupted in pathology studies of neurological diseases, DTI measures are gaining currency in measuring these pathologic changes in life. For example, DTI has detected altered diffusion measures in WM regions appearing normal on conventional MRI scans in subjects with multiple sclerosis 10 and alcoholism. 11 We used the microstructural sensitivity of DTI to examine brain tissue alterations in presymptomatic (Pre-HD) and symptomatic HD. We hypothesized (1) that the anatomy of WM degeneration would correspond to fiber bundles associated with regions of accelerated gray matter atrophy 4,10 -14 ; (2) that tissue changes would be present early, before the onset of motor symptoms; and (3) that tissue measures would be associated with specific clinical measures in patients with HD. We used complementary data analysis approaches, with hypothesis-based region of interest (ROI) analyses providing manual, individualized measures of tissue integrity, and whole brain voxel-based maps allowing for exploratory analyses of regions not hypothesized to show tissue changes in HD. We examined whether WM degeneration occurs early in the disease process by studying a group of early symptomatic individuals as well as a group of individuals known to carry the gene for HD but who were asymptomatic.",

      "text": "HD (n ϭ 17) and Pre-HD (n ϭ 15) subjects were recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Movement Disorders Clinic, and control subjects (n ϭ 29) were recruited from the community. All HD subjects had unequivocal motor symptoms and a known family history of HD. All Pre-HD subjects carried a trinucleotide repeat expansion and did not have motor symptoms of HD. All subjects were assessed by a neurologist from the Movement Disorders Clinic at MGH (H.D.R. or S.M.H.). Subjects with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the previous year or taking medications or experimental agents that could mask motor symptoms were excluded. Procedures were fully explained to all subjects and written informed consent was obtained before scanning. Protocols were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines provided by the internal review board at MGH. All subjects were assessed with cognitive and functional components of the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Additional assessments of the HD and Pre-HD groups included a motor evaluation. Cognitive assessment included standardized neuropsychological tests, including Verbal Fluency, Symbol Digit Modalities, and Stroop Color Word test. The total functional capacity (TFC) score is a measure of a patients capacity in functional realms, including employability, ability to manage finances, domestic responsibilities, and self-care. TFC scores range from 13 (full capacity) to 0 (total incapacity); this metric is sensitive to early changes in disability. 15 All subjects with HD were in early stages of disease (Stages I, corresponding to a TFC Ն 11, or Stage II, corresponding to TFC values of 8 to 10 16 ) and were living independently. Pre-HD subjects included in this study had a score of at most a 1 confidence rating; a score of 0 indicates a normal examination, 1 indicates minor soft neurological signs that are considered nonspecific.",

The effective diffusion gradient was  ϭ 37 msec and the bandwidth was 1445 Hzpixel. Images were collected as oblique axial along the plane of the anterior-posterior commissure. Due to a software upgrade, diffusion scan parameters differed only in the TR ϭ 9 msec and 8 averages for the comparison of Pre-HD and Pre-HD control subjects. The difference between the scan sequences would only be expected to increase the signal to noise ratio in the Pre-HD analyses; however, given that even slight differences in scan protocols could affect results, all statistical comparisons were performed only between groups scanned with identical scan parameters. The 2 mm 3 voxel resolution achieved was useful to minimize partial volume contamination among gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), compared to standard clinical scans often described in the literature. The DTI acquisitions used a twice-refocused balanced echo, developed to significantly reduce eddy current distortions. 17 Two high-resolution T1-weighted scans (TE ϭ 3.0 msec; TR ϭ 7.25 msec; flip angle, 7 degrees; field of view, 256; matrix, 256 ϫ 192; 1.3 mm sagittal acquisition; NEX ϭ 1) were acquired on all subjects.",

Use of the spatially normalized low diffusion volume allowed for more consistent placement of ROIs without confounding this placement by differentially distorted scan acquisition. All ROIs were placed by the same rater (N.H.) using a standardized placement procedure that used atlas based reference maps with morphological landmarks. ROIs were created with the intent of sampling FA within a homogenous fiber population, and regional designations were supported by superimposed tensor information.\nROIs were placed in each individuals T2 scan in the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) and in the anterior and posterior limbs and the genu of the internal capsule. CC ROIs were defined on the mid-sagittal slice and internal capsule ROIs were defined in the axial plane. We additionally placed ROIs in the caudate, putamen, and the pallidum, defined on a coronal slice 8 mm posterior to the anterior commissure. It is important to note that, although DTI studies have focused the measurement technique of WM integrity, a number of studies have used FA as a more generic measure of tissue integrity, and the contrast provided by FA is not technically limited to WM. ROIs in the IC and CC were a sphere with a radius of 3 mm, for a total volume of 33 mm 3 ; because of the significant atrophy of the basal ganglia, ROIs in these basal ganglia structures were 12 mm 3 . This procedure allowed us to avoid arbitrary sizes of ROIs across subjects. Measure of tissue integrity and the contrast provided by FA is not technically limited to WM. To assess the Intrarater reliability, ROIs were placed by the same rater in 12 subjects from each group twice; the intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.87 to 0.97, demonstrating excellent intrarater reliability.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The prevailing model of HD views the clinical symptoms as resulting from abnormal functioning of basalganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry, 24 originating largely from striatal degeneration. Our results demonstrate that corticocortical and corticofugal WM abnormalities also occur in HD and that such changes are correlated with clinical and cognitive measures. Furthermore, the changes are also in place before the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, together with our previous findings of early and progressive cortical thinning, 4 the current data suggest that the clinical expression of HD is also a result of abnormalities in distinct white matter tracts. WM volume loss has been reported previously in neuroimaging studies of symptomatic HD 10,25 and in postmortem studies, but it has been unclear whether these changes occur globally or are more regionally restricted. Given our previous findings of regionally selective thinning of the cortex in both symptomatic and in presymptomatic subjects, we hypothesized that selective alterations would also be present in WM regions that were functionally associated with cortical areas that we have reported previously as thinned in HD and in Pre-HD. By extension, this finding suggested also that only those regions of a WM bundle that were functionally correlated to these specific cortical areas would demonstrate alterations in FA and similarly that other regions would be unchanged. We also hypothesized that these alterations played an important role in some of the clinical symptoms of HD. Finally, as recent reports have suggested that even gray matter structures have intrinsic FA values and, as the striatum is known to be severely affected in HD, we also studied the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus.\nIn our study, we found that alterations in the microstructural integrity of select regions of interest, as measured by FA, were indeed present. In the internal capsule, decreases in FA were found in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The exploratory analyses supported this finding and also suggested alterations in posterior frontal WM and the cerebral peduncles, constituents of the corticospinal pathway, in both HD and Pre-HD subjects. Our previous findings of significant thinning in the sensorimotor cortex further supports our hypothesis that the brain is affected in a nonrandom manner and suggests that brain regions that subserve similar functions may be affected in parallel. Parenthetically, the primary motor cortex has been found to have large numbers of huntingtin aggregates, 26 and early involvement of this pathway may explain the hyper-reflexia that is found early in disease.\nThe CC has received little attention in HD, but it is the major source of commissural information transfer in the",

Exploratory wholebrain analyses demonstrated significant reductions in FA in the internal capsule (IC), frontal subcortical white matter (WM), and portions of the thalamus, and increases in FA in the putamen in the group of presymptomatic individuals known to carry the genetic mutation that causes Huntingtons disease (Pre-HD; upper panel), paralleling the results of the region of interest analysis. In the early stage Huntingtons disease (HD) group, significant increases in the putamen and globus pallidus were seen; reductions in FA included the IC, corpus callosum (CC), external extreme capsule, cerebral peduncles, brainstem, and WM underlying brain regions, including sensorimotor cortex, frontal, parietal, and parieto-occipital areas. Blue areas show areas of statistically significant increases in FA; yellow areas show areas of statistically significant reductions in FA.\nbrain. It is one of the most heavily myelinated regions of the brains and is topographically organized longitudinally from genu to splenium. 27 Considering this organization, and in light of our findings of thinning involving posterior frontal regions in presymptomatic subjects, 21 we also hypothesized that regional changes in the CC would correspond to regional cortical atrophy. In Pre-HD subjects, changes in FA were present selectively in the body of the CC. As expected, in HD subjects, FA changes were more widespread, presumably related to more widespread atrophy in the symptomatic stages of the disease. Consonant with our observations, others have reported deficits in presymptomatic subjects in cognitive tasks requiring executive function and nonspatial working memory, 28 -31 tasks that require commissural transfer between cortical dorsolateral prefrontal and partietal cortex, for example. An important role for these regional alterations of the corpus callosum in the symptoms of HD is supported by the finding of relationships between regional FA and clinical variables. We found a significant correlation between performance on the Stoop and verbal fluency and FA of the genu and body. This finding suggests that alterations in the corpus callosum are important and may reflect the pathological changes in the cerebral cortex.\nIt is still not clear what reductions in FA mean with respect to specific neuropathological changes in the HD brain. Reductions in FA may be caused by several processes, including a decrease in the number or density of axons, diminished myelination of axons, or decreased orientational coherence of the fiber tracts. Microstructural changes in WM may have been predicted by previous work in which huntingtin aggregates, 32333435 altered axonal morphology, 36 -39 and slowed axoplasmic transport 40 have been demonstrated in axons from brains of patients with HD. The selective vulnerability of specific WM components, such as those that make up corticos-triatal pathways, is consistent with previous neuroimaging studies 25 that have demonstrated significant atrophy of white matter and in neuropathological studies that have shown early degeneration of these pathways in HD. 13,40 In our study, unexpected increases in both FA and diffusivity, as measured by ADC, were found in the putamen and globus pallidus, in both Pre-HD and HD subjects. Increases in ADC values for the striatum have been shown previously, 41 but FA measures in HD have not been reported previously. In our study, caudate FA and ADC values were not significantly different. In general, FA and diffusivity are negatively correlated. 39 The divergence of this typical pattern in the basal ganglia in our study suggests a unique pathology in these structures in early HD that is distinct from atrophy. We speculate that increases in FA could result from pathologic processes that modify tissue integrity, such as neuronal remodeling and loss and secondary astrocytosis, loss of specific fiber tracts, changes in fiber composition, or changes in cell permeability; however, the biophysical basis of pathologic alterations in FA is currently unknown. The caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus are known to have fibrillary astrocytosis in HD, and neuronal remodeling within the striatum has been demonstrated in postmortem studies of HD. 42 Importantly, tissue changes were apparent in Pre-HD subjects in the absence of significant WM volume loss, suggesting that subtle morphological alterations occur before the development of overt motor symptoms. The concordance of the regional changes in Pre-HD and HD subjects in both this study supports the validity of the findings and suggests that WM degeneration is a progressive phenomenon with advancing disease; however, this conclusion needs to be confirmed in a longitudinal study. Our work provides evidence of early and progressive pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor systems degeneration that parallels the cortical thinning of sensorimotor regions in HD. Whether the WM changes reflect a primary degeneration, such as demyelination, or occur secondary to cortical gray matter degeneration remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that alterations in cortical neurons and their connectivity likely contribute to the early clinical symptoms that occur in HD. Whereas motor slowing and hyper-reflexia become evident in the middle stages of disease as obvious cortical signs, early cognitive and subtle motor impairment during the preclinical stages of disease are also likely to have some basis in compromised cortical circuitry.",

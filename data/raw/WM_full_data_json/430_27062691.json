    "abstract": "Verbal fluency (VF) impairments occur early in Alzheimers disease (AD) and to a lesser extent also in normal aging. However, the neural underpinnings of these impairments are not fully understood. The present study evaluated whether VF impairments in early AD and normal aging rely upon common or different neuroanatomical correlates. We examined the association between VF performance and brain structure in 18 mild AD patients and 24 healthy elderly. Linear regressions were performed between accuracy and time intervals in VF scores and structural measurements of cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) using MRI. Results showed that semantic VF correlated exclusively with GM in cerebellum, left temporal fusiform cortex, and WM in uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus callosum. Phonemic VF showed unique associations between intervals and WM in left-hemisphere tracts. The association between GM in hippocampus, subcortical structures and semantic accuracy differentiated patients from controls. Results showed that VF impairments are primarily associated with same structural brain changes in AD as in healthy elderly but at exaggerated levels. However, specific VF deficiencies and their underlying neural correlates exist and these clearly differentiate the initial stages of AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Impaired word finding is a cognitive deficit occurring early in Alzheimers disease (AD). It is usually assessed by verbal fluency (VF) performance, which measures the speed and accuracy of produced words according to phonemic or semantic cues. In the phonemic variant, individuals must generate words starting with a designated letter, while the semantic variant requires generating exemplars from a certain category. All verbal fluency tests (VFT) are time limited to usually 1 min (Benton, 1967). Despite comparable demands on both VFTs, such as sustained attention, strategic search and articulation, each variant also assess exclusive cognitive capacities. Semantic VF better evaluates semantic memory as it relies upon the integrity of conceptual knowledge storage (Henry, Crawford,  Phillips, 2004). In turn, phonemic VF demands higher executive functioning (Bryan  Luszcz, 2000) due to more engagement of working memory processes in the selection and matching of words based on orthographic cues and of inhibitory processes suppressing semantic associations (Shao, Janse, Visser,  Meyer, 2014). Performance across both types of VFTs is significantly impaired early in AD (Laws, Duncan,  Gale, 2010), but semantic VF appears to be particularly affected due to the breakdown of semantic memory (Henry et al., 2004). A decline in VF is also associated with normal aging, but to a lesser degree than in AD (Clark et al., 2009;Kozora  Cullum, 1995). Currently, it is not known whether there is a common cause for the VF impairments in AD and normal aging or if there are different underlying mechanisms.\nFunctional studies on healthy subjects have shown that VF relies on a network of regions, primarily in the left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, caudate, middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobe (Birn et al., 2010). There is also evidence that the phonemic and semantic fluency utilize slightly different functional networks. Lesion studies have shown that lesions in the temporal lobe affect mainly semantic fluency (Henry  Crawford, 2004;Monsch et al., 1994) while lesions in the frontal lobe tend to affect phonemic fluency more than semantic fluency (Baldo, Shimamura, Delis, Kramer,  Kaplan, 2001;Henry  Crawford, 2004). This is generally supported by fMRI studies contrasting the two types of verbal fluency tasks. Birn et al. (2010) found larger activation for phonemic fluency in the left precentral and inferior frontal gyrus, ventral occipitotemporal cortex bilaterally and superior parietal cortex bilaterally. Whereas semantic fluency had greater activation in occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus bilaterally and left middle frontal gyrus compared to phonemic fluency (Birn et al., 2010). Although VF tends to activate regions primarily in the left hemisphere, healthy older people have a more bilateral activation pattern compared to younger people (Meinzer et al., 2009). To our knowledge, there are no fMRI studies of VF in AD or in the preclinical stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nThere are however, crucial differences between the VF tasks used in fMRI studies and the standard VF tasks, which makes a direct comparison problematic. VFTs for fMRI studies need to be adapted for their assessment in scanner conditions. For instance, it could be required that responses are given after a cue, or within short intervals (e.g., 5 s). An alternative approach is therefore, to study neuroanatomical correlates to VF in order to understand the brain networks involved during performance of these tasks. This issue is especially relevant in conditions like AD, where massive brain degeneration exists. For instance, it is known that semantic fluency impairments in AD are related to reduced gray matter (GM) volume in the medial temporal lobes including the hippocampus and left fronto-temporal regions (Dos Santos et al., 2011;Serra et al., 2010;Venneri et al., 2008). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that phonemic fluency impairments are associated with GM volume reduction in the orbitofrontal cortex (Serra et al., 2010), left middle and superior frontal gyri, right inferior frontal gyrus and several regions on the temporal and occipital lobes (Venneri et al., 2008). In early AD, the greater impairment in semantic fluency versus phonemic fluency has been explained by the disproportionate degeneration of temporal lobe structures in relationship to frontal lobe regions (Haugrud, Crossley,  Vrbancic, 2011).\nVF performance has also been associated with white matter (WM) integrity. However, the findings are divergent. Some investigators have found among AD and MCI patients an association between semantic fluency and FA in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum as well as with the posterior periventricular WM (Chen et al., 2009;Kavcic, Ni, Zhu, Zhong,  Duffy, 2008). However, others have failed to find any significant association (Serra et al., 2010).\nDivergent findings regarding the brain networks involved during VF performance might be explained, to some extent, by the great variation among studies on type of verbal fluency examined and type of parameter employed to assess VF performance. For example, some studies only assess semantic VF (Chen et al., 2009;Kavcic et al., 2008), while other address phonemic VF (Sjobeck et al., 2010) or both (Charlton et al., 2006;Serra et al., 2010).\nTo understand the neural substrates of VF performance, proper measurements of word generation are required. Usually, most studies only register accuracy scores (correct words) which are then correlated with neuroanatomical parameters. In spite of been a customary procedure, this approach might not be optimal. Sailor and coworkers (Sailor, Antoine, Diaz, Kuslansky,  Kluger, 2004) suggested a detailed analysis comprising intervals (between word latencies) and accuracy data for understanding word retrieval impairments in AD. So far, only accuracy data have been used to correlate with brain neuroanatomy and therefore, we propose that the addition of in-between word intervals is a relevant measure to apprise the common element of processing speed in both VF tests.\nAnother source of discrepancy regarding the brain-behavior associations of VF performance is the focus on either GM or WM status separately. Although, AD is regarded primarily as a disease affecting cerebral gray matter, white matter degeneration also occurs at preclinical stages (Kehoe, McNulty, Mullins,  Bokde, 2014). In the initial phases, GM loss is restricted to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, while WM degeneration occurs in parahippocampal regions as well as in areas connecting directly to medial temporal lobe structures (Salat et al., 2010). Thus, to understand the anatomical correlates contributing to VF impairments in early AD, an evaluation of GM and WM degeneration is necessary. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the parallel contribution of GM and WM degeneration on altered verbal production in aging and dementia. Therefore, in this study we aimed to better understand the neural correlates of VF tasks among elderly patients at the early stages of AD and a group of healthy older adults. We hypothesize that the involvement of reduced GM volume and WM degeneration will differ between VF tasks due to specific cognitive requirements of each task and between groups due to the brain degeneration in AD.\n(1) For semantic VF, we expect a significant association between impaired performance and subcortical GM loss in medial temporal structures in AD patients. We furthermore hypothesize that WM integrity in networks connecting the parahippocampal regions will also be associated with semantic VF impairments. As a whole, we expect that semantic VF correlates positively with a broad network of brain regions reported in previous studies that include bilateral GM and WM in inferior and middle frontal gyri, superior temporal gyri, cerebellum and supplementary motor areas (Meinzer et al., 2009;Nagels et al., 2012). (2) For the phonemic VF we hypothesize that possible group differences may exist in the degree of association and not in different brain networks associated. Although, frontal areas have been often associated with phonemic VF, we cannot be certain to expect a special correlation between phonemic outcomes and frontal lobe regions as no functional study has yet tested the type of networks underlying phonemic VF in AD or MCI subjects. Nonetheless, based on the literature, elderly samples are expected to show significant correlations between phonemic VF scores and a diffuse network comprising frontal, temporal and parietal regions as well as the cerebellum (Melrose et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2013).",

      "text": "Participants were recruited for a larger aging study at the University of Tromsø, Norway. Originally 53 individuals were recruited; however seven patients and one control were excluded due to movement artifacts or an incomplete scanning session. Additionally, three more did not complete neuropsychological testing. The final sample included 42 participants; 18 AD patients and 24 healthy elderly controls. The patient group was recruited at the University Hospital of North-Norway from the Neurology and Geriatrics departments. Only mild AD patients with a Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein,  McHugh, 1975) greater than 20 were included in the study. Each patient underwent clinical and neurological examinations including standard check of CSF concentrations of tau, phosphorylated tau and b-amyloid. Diagnosis was performed by a senior geriatrician orand a senior neurologist according to the DSM-IV and the NINCDS-ADRDA (Mckhann et al., 1984) criteria for probable AD. Moreover, final inclusion of all patients was based upon verification of initial clinical diagnosis carried out a year after these individuals were tested and scanned.\nControl subjects were community-dwelling elderly residing in North-Norway who were recruited through advertisements, and were all native Norwegian speakers. Controls were screened for dementia and depression with the MMSE and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck, Steer,  Garbin, 1988) respectively, and underwent neuropsychological assessment to assure normal cognitive functioning. To ensure inclusion of healthy subjects, only participants having MMSE score greater than 28, and not depressed according to the adapted BDI criteria for the elderly (Rodríguez-Aranda, 2003) were recruited. Additionally, the entire control group was free of psychiatric or neurological illness, tumors, drug or alcohol abuse. A neuroradiologist screened the MR images for major pathologies such as infarctions or tumors. All participants provided signed, informed consent prior to participation in the study. Concerning the AD group, only patients who were able to give their informed consent were enrolled. The study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee.",

Both tasks were presented on a computer using the E-prime computer program (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Subjects sat in front of a computer wearing a headset microphone for recording answers. Subsequently, participants were asked to start generating words as soon as a letter or category appeared on the screen during 1 min. Every stimulus remained on the screen during the whole trial.\nFollowing Sailor et al. (2004), two main outcomes were extracted: Accuracy scores (number of correct words) and intervals (duration between words). Intervals were obtained by measuring latencies from end of a word to the onset of the next one. Accuracy and interval scores were converted to z-scores and averaged over the two types of VF producing a phonemic and semantic compound score for accuracy and intervals. Importantly, initial reaction times were removed since they reflect the subjects first response to a presented stimulus and cannot be comparable to in-between word intervals (Rohrer, Salmon, Wixted,  Paulsen, 1999).",

      "text": "Preprocessing and statistical analysis of the DTI data was done using the FSL software library (v4.1.5) (Smith et al., 2004). The three DTI series were merged and corrected for motion and eddy currents using FLIRT (Jenkinson  Smith, 2001). Brain masks for each participant was created using BET (Smith, 2002). The diffusion tensor and three diffusion indices; fractional anisotropy (FA) (Pierpaoli  Basser, 1996), mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MO) (Ennis  Kindlmann, 2006) were calculated using the dtifit program in FSL. FA is a measure of the directionality of the diffusion, taking values between 0 (isotropic diffusion) and 1 (infinite anisotropic diffusion), and MD is the average diffusion. Both FA and MD are sensitive, but relatively unspecific markers of WM microstructure. Studies have shown that FA is sensitive to several microstructural parameters of WM including myelination (Song et al., 2005), axonal packing density (Beaulieu, 2002) and gliosis (Budde, Janes, Gold, Turtzo,  Frank, 2011), rendering the relationship between FA and microstructural parameters complex. Although it is difficult to associate changes in MD or FA to specific physiological changes in WM, a consistent finding is that FA is reduced, and MD is increased (Agosta et al., 2011;Douaud et al., 2011;Smith et al., 2013) in AD patients. The MO index describes the shape of the diffusion tensor, and varies between À1 (planar anisotropic diffusion) and 1 (linear anisotropic diffusion). MO is mathematically orthogonal to FA, and thus offers complementary information over FA (Ennis  Kindlmann, 2006). Recent findings suggest that MO can detect selective degradation of crossing WM tracts in AD patients (Douaud et al., 2011;Teipel et al., 2014).\nVoxel-wise statistics were performed using TBSS (v1.2) (Smith et al., 2006) part of FSL. Since the study population consisted of older people, many with substantial enlargement of the ventricles, we used a study-specific target for the nonlinear transformation. Default parameters in TBSS were used to produce the FA skeleton.",

Next, a study-specific gray matter template was created and all native GM images were registered to this template and modulated to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation.

Additionally, controls were faster and more accurate to generate words than patients in most parameters of the VFTs except for the intervals in the phonemic task. In line with previous studies (Agosta et al., 2011;Serra et al., 2010), the AD group had reduced GM density primarily in the medial temporal lobes, which are among the first areas affected by the disease. For the DTI data, we found a group effect only for the MO index, where the AD group had significantly lower MO in several WM tracts. A decrease in MO signifies a transition from a linear to a more planar shape of the diffusion tensor (Ennis  Kindlmann, 2006) which indicates a more disordered WM fiber structure (Douaud et al., 2011). The tracts found to differ in MO are in line with recent results from AD and MCI patients (Douaud et al., 2011(Douaud et al., , 2013)). The findings suggest that MO might reveal subtle WM differences in early AD not captured by FA or MD. However, further studies are needed to clarify this matter. The lack of group differences in FA and MD is unusual given the significant difference in MO. A possible explanation is that we had a very mild AD group with a mean MMSE score of 24.7, whereas studies that find group differences in FA or MD have AD groups with lower MMSE scores. For example, Agosta et al. (2011) reported group differences in FA and MD between mild AD and MCI subjects, where the AD group had MMSE score of 19.5, and MCI group had 25.8. Also, other factors such as sample size, image quality and analysis method will affect statistical power (Stebbins  Murphy, 2009).

      "text": "Assessment of the associations between VF scores and imaging data showed that the DTI parameter on which our groups differed, MO, was the only outcome that did not correlate with any of the VF scores. This puzzling finding is difficult to address, though, a possible explanation is that MO being orthogonal to FA, provides complementary information to the FA index (Ennis  Kindlmann, 2006). Our data indicate that changes in MO are not as sensitive to cognitive outcomes as are changes in FA or MD. It would be very beneficial that further studies address the implication of MO parameter for brain-behavior associations.\nAs for the rest of the correlations, results confirmed our expectation that extensive areas of the brain covering various bilateral areas of GM and large parts of the WM skeleton were associated with all semantic fluency scores. This finding suggest that the search on the semantic storage as well as the efficiency of processing speed to retrieve semantic information rely on the integrity of a broad and spread network of brain areas.\nIn contrast, results from phonemic fluency showed that not all VF scores were significantly associated with imaging data. Accuracy scores on this task were associated with both gray and white matter parameters, which implies that the capacity of correctly generate exemplars matching an orthographic cue relies on the integrity of brain network including Brocas area, left insular cortex and bilateral hippocampi as well as several WM tracts. Although, bilateral areas were observed to correlate with accuracy scores a trend for associations on the left hemisphere was observed. This result corroborate earlier reports (Meinzer et al., 2009).\nConcerning the phonemic VF intervals, our data showed that these correlated only with WM integrity, albeit just with one of the DTI measures, but not with GM volumes. This finding contrasts with results from the semantic VF and it suggests that WM integrity plays a strong role in processing speed of phonemic word generation. In the past, investigations have proposed that cerebral WM subserves efficient processing speed in different non-verbal tasks in normal samples of different ages (Walhovd  Fjell, 2007), healthy elderly adults (Kerchner et al., 2012;Lu et al., 2011) and AD (Ready et al., 2011). However, our data indicate that the role of WM on language processing speed depends on type of task executed.",

    "Semantic VF": {
      "text": "In essence, semantic VF was the task showing the most various significant associations after controlling for phonemic VF. We believe that these results, in much, demonstrate the reason for why the semantic VF is much more relevant than phonemic VF in the early detection of dementia. As expected, the network of areas associated exclusively with semantic VF scores included GM and WM regions. GM volumes on the left cerebellum included Crus II and IX, which correlated positively with semantic accuracy. This finding was also expected since previous studies have suggested the importance of the cerebellum in VFTs (Ackermann, Mathiak,  Riecker, 2007). Nevertheless, it is necessary to mention that a number of investigations have reported the involvement of the cerebellum as most prominent for phonemic (Marien et al., 2014;Senhorini et al., 2011) than for semantic VF. In addition, and as stated in hypothesis (1), we confirmed the involvement of medial temporal lobe regions in semantic VF. Among the significant areas related to semantic scores, the left temporal fusiform cortex correlated negatively with semantic intervals, which is in agreement with Birn et al. (2010). These authors showed a greater activation of the fusiform cortex during performance of semantic VF. However, in this study the implication of the fusiform cortex was linked to the switching between categories and not only to the time elapsed between words.\nResults regarding associations of WM tracts with semantic intervals are noteworthy. The remaining tracts showing significant relevance after controlling for phonemic intervals were not surprisingly language-related tracts important for semantic retrieval. These tracts included the uncinate fasciculus, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, forceps minor and large parts of corpus callosum. The uncinate fasciculus has been associated with deficits in semantic processing speed (Catani et al., 2013) as well as with verbal abstraction, lexical retrieval and naming (Agosta et al., 2010). In AD, the uncinate fasciculus is of further importance because this tract connects the inferior frontal lobe with the anterior temporal lobes and it contains cholinergic fibers from the basal nucleus of Meynert that shows typical degeneration in AD (Morikawa et al., 2010). Moreover, a recent investigation provides evidence about the importance of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus in subserving semantic memory (de Zubicaray, Rose,  McMahon, 2011) among healthy older adults. The rest of the remaining tracts were parts of the corpus callosum, with special involvement of the forceps minor, which are brain regions susceptible to the effects of aging and AD (Gold, Johnson, Powell,  Smith, 2012). The association between integrity of corpus callosum and higher cognitive abilities like executive functions and verbal fluency has been reported in earlier studies (Jokinen et al., 2007;Meguro et al., 2003).",

    "Phonemic VF": {
      "text": "As for phonemic fluency, only one positive association remained significant after controlling for semantic scores. This correlation was between intervals and MD mainly in tracts of the left hemisphere including anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The latter connections are primarily language-related pathways (Bernal  Altman, 2010;Catani  Mesulam, 2008) while the confine region involved is part of the internal capsule, which is thought to subserve working memory processes (Kennedy  Raz, 2009). The fact of obtaining a left-lateralized association for phonemic VF in our set of participants could be interpreted as an evidence that this VFT is a more clean-cut language task, which is independent of the brain regions subserving semantic processes that are greatly disrupted in AD.",

    "Differential association in patients and controls": {
      "text": "An important finding of the present study concerns the interaction effect differentiating our groups of subjects. Indeed, the association between semantic accuracy and GM density in putamen, superior and inferior colliculi clearly distinguished AD patients from controls (Fig. 2). This differentiation between AD patients and healthy elderly has not been previously reported. Earlier studies have either reported significant correlations between semantic fluency and GM loss in diverse areas of the neocortex (Venneri et al., 2008) or none association at all (Fama et al., 2000). These conflicting results might be in part due to the exclusive evaluation of AD patients in these investigations. In our study, we have addressed this limitation by including patients and healthy agematched controls in the correlational analyses. Such an approach was adopted to identify common and group specific correlates between GM density and VF. As it is recognized, the aging process is accompanied by GM loss in the hippocampal regions that are strongly affected in AD (Leal  Yassa, 2013).\nThe association of additional subcortical structures that do not pertain to the hippocampal formation with VF outcomes is noteworthy. For instance, previous studies have found the putamen important for speech production (Crosson et al., 2003;Price, 2010), articulation (Price, 2010) and VF performance (Baldo, Schwartz, Wilkins,  Dronkers, 2006;Thames et al., 2012). In the present study, we found that besides the putamen, both colliculi from the midbrain were also associated to semantic accuracy. This finding was unexpected. In the past, histological data have demonstrated that damage to both colliculi is a unique feature of neurodegeneration in AD that does not occur in normal aging (Parvizi, Van Hoesen,  Damasio, 2001). The colliculi are, in fact, midbrain structures forming the tectum, which are areas for multisensory integration where auditory (Skoe, Krizman, Spitzer,  Kraus, 2013) and visual pathways converge. Nonetheless, there are studies reporting the involvement of the colliculi in verbal behavior (Chandrasekaran, Kraus,  Wong, 2012;Kircher, Brammer, Andreu, Williams,  McGuire, 2001;Klein, Milner, Zatorre, Meyer,  Evans, 1995). Taking into account these reports, it seems that not only cortical but also subcortical structures including the tectum and putamen are involved in the processing of language functions, which has been suggested in the past (Berryhill, Kveraga, Webb,  Hughes, 2007;Crosson  Haaland, 2003;Hikosaka, 2007). Thus, for the present study it remains an open question whether the association between GM loss in the additional subcortical structures and semantic VF has a direct link or whether these findings are rather coexisting events occurring independently at early stages of AD.",

    "Summary of main findings": {
      "text": "To summarize, our first hypothesis was partially confirmed since a broad brain network was associated with all semantic VF scores. In addition, we confirmed a distinctive association in the AD group on which GM volumes in hippocampal structures as well as other, non-expected subcortical areas were associated with semantic accuracy. Regarding hypothesis 2, we did confirm that frontal, temporal and parietal regions were involved in phonemic VF. Nonetheless, an unexpected dissociation between correlations of the phonemic scores and imaging outcomes was found. Accuracy scores in phonemic VF correlated with both GM and WM in a rather left-lateralized network, while phonemic intervals correlated only with WM in extensive brain areas. Finally, when testing for specific associations for each VFT, it was evident that all semantic VF scores exclusively correlated with brain regions known to subserve semantic memory processes, and thus it explains the importance of assessing semantic VF in the early detection of AD.\nIn contrast, speed of information processing for generation of words matching a phonemic cue was found to only correlate with WM integrity of tracts on the left hemisphere.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the neural underpinnings of VF in mild AD patients and healthy older adults. Our findings showed that the neuroanatomical correlates of VF in AD patients and controls in much are similar and differences rely on degree of association due to grade of brain atrophy and subsequent impaired VF performance. This finding is an example of the typical aging-dementia continuum (Leal  Yassa, 2013). Notwithstanding, the unique association observed in the patient group between semantic accuracy and GM loss in putamen and tectum suggests that deterioration in early AD is not only accelerated aging, but a distinct pathology depicting features superimposed to the senescence process (Peters, 2002). Finally, the specific brain-behavior associations for each VFT, may have clinical implications as these tasks are broadly employed in the neuropsychological evaluation of geriatric populations. The main limitation of the study relies on the small samples of subjects evaluated. This limitation prevented us from testing relevant issues such as the gender influence on VF performance often referred in the behavioral literature (Li  Singh, 2014). Future studies with larger samples are required not only to confirm the present findings but also to expand understanding of possible gender effects in VF decline in the early development of AD.",

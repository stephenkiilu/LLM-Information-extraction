    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), the visual variant of Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after AD, are both neurodegenerative disorders that present with progressive decline in visual function (Crutch et al., 2017;McKeith et al., 2005).\nPCA patients present with initial and progressive decline in visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits, with features including simultanagnosia, Gerstmanns syndrome, constructional dyspraxia, environmental agnosia, oculomotor apraxia, dressing apraxia, optic ataxia, and homonymous visual field defect (Crutch et al., 2017). DLB patients present with spontaneous fluctuations in cognition, attention, and arousal (McKeith et al., 2005); recurrent and complex visual hallucinations; spontaneous parkinsonian features such as bradykinesia, rest tremors, rigidity and postural instability (McKeith et al., 2017); and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (Ferman et al., 2011). DLB patients also show visuospatial problems such as difficulty seeing and hence copying 3-dimensional figures. Further, there is overlap between these disorders, with visual hallucinations and RBD sometimes present in PCA (Josephs et al., 2006;T. D. Singh et al., 2015).\nOn neuroimaging, PCA and DLB show overlapping patterns of bilateral occipito-parietal hypometabolism on  18 F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET (Whitwell et al., 2017), although they show very different patterns of gray-matter atrophy. PCA patients show atrophy in the occipital and parietal lobes, often with greater involvement of the right hemisphere (Whitwell et al., 2007), while DLB patients show more focal atrophy of the midbrain and hypothalamus, with relative sparing of the occipital and temporo-parietal lobes and hippocampus (Oppedal et al., 2019;Whitwell et al., 2007). Few reports shed light on the structural and functional connectivity disruptions in both disorders. PCA patients show significant degeneration of the occipito-parietal and temporal white matter (Madhavan et al., 2016;N. A. Singh et al., 2023;Sintini et al., 2019), along with reduced within-network connectivity in the visual network (N. A. Singh et al., 2023), and DLB patients show degeneration of the amygdala white matter (Kantarci et al., 2010) and reduced withinnetwork connectivity in the motor, temporal and frontal networks (Schumacher et al., 2018). However, it is unknown how patterns of structural and functional degeneration compare between PCA and DLB and whether these disruptions relate to atrophy or hypometabolism. Furthermore, most previous DLB studies recruited patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for probable DLB (McKeith et al., 2017), but many probable DLB patients have co-occurring AD pathology (Schneider et al., 2007) evidenced by positive beta-amyloid (Aβ) PET imaging, which could have influenced the findings (Kantarci et al., 2012). Little is known about the neuroimaging features in DLB without any interference of AD pathology.\nThe primary goal of this study was to assess and compare structural and functional connectivity alterations in PCA and DLB. We selected Aβ-positive PCA patients to ensure the group consisted of patients with AD, and we selected Aβ-negative DLB patients to understand the connectivity disruptions associated with the clinical phenotype of DLB without the confounders of AD. Connectivity findings in DLB cohorts which include Aβ-positive patients, may be strongly driven by AD rather than DLB. Our first aim was to assess functional-connectivity profiles utilizing rsfMRI in PCA and DLB to evaluate how within-and between-network functional connectivity differs between them and from cognitively unimpaired healthy individuals. We hypothesized a reduction in the withinnetwork connectivity of the dominant networks for both phenotypes, along with an increase in between-network connectivity implying the presence of compensatory mechanisms due to the loss of connectivity within the dominant networks. Our second aim was to investigate structural connectivity differences between PCA and DLB utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that the white-matter degeneration profiles were similar to patterns of gray-matter atrophy. Lastly, we aimed to determine whether structural and functional connectivity breakdown relates to volumetric or metabolic changes in PCA and DLB. Together, these findings will improve our understanding of the relationship between connectivity breakdowns, hypometabolism, and atrophy, and advance our knowledge of the pathophysiology of classical Aβ-negative DLB, without the interference of AD pathology.",

In addition to fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria, patients also underwent a 3T MRI scan that included a resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences, FDG PET, and a Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET scan. we included only Aβ-positive PCA patients and Aβ-negative DLB patients and excluded Aβ-negative PCA patients and Aβ-positive DLB patients. We also excluded patients with structural abnormalities that could cause cognitive impairment or dementia or with concurrent illnesses or treatment interfering with cognitive function. The Neurodegenerative Research group (NRG) recruited all the PCA patients between July 08, 2013, and September 12, 2019. The Alzheimers Disease Research Center (ADRC; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) recruited the DLB patients between September 29, 2009, and September 26, 2017. All patients underwent extensive neurological and neuropsychological evaluations and identical imaging protocols Investigators providing clinical diagnoses were blinded to imaging results. We selected a cohort of 30 age-matched Aβ-negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) between March 18, 2010, andAugust 01, 2016, who underwent the identical neuroimaging protocol.",

    "Image acquisition": {
      "text": "All patients underwent scanning with a 3T volumetric MRI on GE scanners (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN including a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TRTET1  23003900 ms; 26 cm field of view, slice thickness  1.2 mm, in plane resolution  1 mm) (Jack et al., 2008), a DTI and rsfMRI acquisition. The DTI acquisition consisted of a single-shot echo-planer (EPI) pulse sequence in the axial plane (TR  10, 200 ms; in plane matrix  128128, FOV  35 cm, slice thickness  2.7 mm, phase FOV  0.66, 41 b  1000smm 2 diffusion encoding directions), evenly spread over an entire sphere, and 5 non-diffusion weighted (b  0) volumes. Parallel imaging with SENSE factor of 2 was used. The rsfMRI acquisition used gradient echo planer imaging (TE  30 ms; slice thickness  3.3 mm, in plane resolution  3.3 mm and 160 vol), with participants instructed to keep their eyes open during the scan (Sintini et al., 2021). All images met quality control standards, with median quality-control analyst rating of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 being high quality and 4 being lowest quality). Further all fMRI images also met the fMRI protocol standards and motion parameters (scans exceeding 1.5 mm translation or 1.5 rotation were excluded).\nAll PET scans were acquired on a PETCT scanner. For Aβ PET, participants were injected with  628MBq (range 385-723MBq) of PiB followed by a 40-min uptake period and acquisition time of a 20-mins. For FDG-PET, participants were injected with  459MBq (range 367-576MBq) of fluorodeoxyglucose followed by a 30-min uptake period. PET acquisition was carried out for 8 mins, consisting of four 2-minute dynamic frames after a low-dose CT image. The scans consisted of four 5-minute dynamic frames after a low-dose CT image. Standard corrections were applied, and the PET sinograms were reconstructed into a 256 mm FOV. The four individual frames were averaged for analysis (Whitwell et al., 2019). Detailed acquisition details have been previously published (Josephs et al., 2012). The Aβ PET images were registered to their corresponding subject-space MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI using SPM12 and a global PiB standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) was calculated, as previously described (Jack et al., 2019). An SUVR cut-point of 1.48 was used to define Aβ-positivity (Jack et al., 2019;Jack et al., 2017). All PET images met quality-control standards, with median quality control analyst rating of 2.\n2.5. Image processing 2.5.1. Functional connectivity-All fMRI images were preprocessed using CONN functional connectivity toolbox(Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012) (www.nitrc.orgprojectsconn). The preprocessing discarded the first 10 vol to generate a steady-state magnetization, slice time correction, re-alignment (motion estimation and correction), with outlier detection, segmentation and direct normalization to MNI template space, smoothing with a gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width, half maximum, nuisance regression for white matter, CSF signal, denoised for 6 head motion parameters with their first and second-order derivatives (Power et al., 2014;Power et al., 2015), and bandpass filtered in the 0.01-0.1 Hz frequency to reduce low-frequency drift and noise effects (Lowe et al., 1998). Of note, there was no difference across the three groups in the mean framewise displacement (p  0.43) and mean motion (p  0.41) for the fMRI scans (Table 1). After preprocessing, the functional images were parcellated into cortical and subcortical areas using the Harvard-Oxford atlas, CONNs network parcellations atlas which was generated using independent component analysis (ICA) on the HCP dataset (N  497) and Mayo Clinic intrinsic connectivity networks identified in a sample of healthy older participants from the MCSA (Jones et al., 2012;Wiepert et al., 2017). The mean blood-oxygen-leveldependent (BOLD) time series within each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas were extracted. Pearsons R correlation coefficients were calculated across all ROIs and were transformed to Fishers R-to-Z transformations.\nNetwork (ROI-to-ROI) level connectivity was generated for 12 networks. Default mode network (DMN) (anterior dorsal DMN; anterior ventral DMN; ventral DMN; posterior DMN) subnetworks were defined using MCSAs intrinsic connectivity networks. The cerebellar, dorsal attention, salience, and fronto-parietal networks were defined using CONNs network parcellations atlas, while the visual, sensorimotor, memory and language were defined using meaningful network-specific ROIs from the Harvard-Oxford atlas, where the functional connectivity of a network was generated by averaging the signal across multiple regions of interest within that network. These networks were chosen for their association with cognitive functioning (Jones et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2010) and the dominant aspects of PCA (Migliaccio et al., 2016) and DLB (Schumacher et al., 2021). We extracted within-and between-network functional connectivity values for all networks. (Veraart et al., 2016) the DTI scan, head motion and eddy current distortion were corrected using FSLs eddy Cuda program (Andersson et al., 2017;Andersson et al., 2016;Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016). We corrected for Gibbs ringing as described previously (Kellner et al., 2016), and then skullstripped the images (Reid et al., 2018). We removed the Rician noise bias using the noise image from denoising and the procedure outlined previously (Koay et al., 2009). Diffusion tensors were estimated using nonlinear least squares fitting and used to calculate Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) images in dipy (Garyfallidis et al., 2014). We used the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Eve single-subject white-matter atlas (Oishi et al., 2009) to identify specific white-matter tracts and ROI to extract their FA and MD values. We assessed 5 white-matter ROIs: lateral occipital (superior, middle, and inferior occipital), superior parietal, superior temporal, middle temporal and inferior temporal, along with 10 white-matter tracts: posterior thalamic radiation, splenium of corpus collosum, sagittal stratum, fornix, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and retrolenticular part of internal capsule. These ROIs and tracts were selected based on previous cross-sectional DTI findings in PCA (Madhavan et al., 2016) and DLB (Kantarci et al., 2010).",

Uptake in all voxels in the FDG PET images were normalized to the uptake in the pons whitematter to generate FDG SUVR images (Minoshima et al., 1997). Both MRI gray-matter segmentations and FDG PET SUVR images were spatially normalized to the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) template and smoothed at 6 mm full width at half maximum. Patterns of gray-matter volume loss and hypometabolism were assessed at the voxel-level using SPM12, adjusted for age and sex. These models were corrected for family wise error (FWE) at q  0.05 for volume loss and q  0.001 for FDG uptake. Results were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template for visualizing and generating images using BrainNet viewer (Xia et al., 2013). Furthermore, regional gray-matter volume and FDG-PET SUVR values were calculated to allow multimodal comparisons. For the multimodal analysis, associations were only evaluated with regions found to be significant in the previous analysis. Regional gray-matter volumes and FDG PET SUVR composite were extracted from the MCALT atlas. Composites for gray-matter volumes and FDG PET SUVR were also generated for each network using the same atlas employed in the rsfMRI analysis i.e., Harvard-Oxford atlas.",

      "text": "Conditions of normality and equal variance were assessed for each model and were determined adequate for applying multivariate linear-regression methodology. Additionally, collinearity was not an issue for the models considered. For the within-network connectivity analysis, 12 separate multivariate linear-regression models assessed the relationship between the groups of interest (PCA, DLB, and CU) for all networks, while adjusting for age and sex effects. After fitting the models, we adjusted estimates for group contrasts for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method. For the DTI analysis, before modeling the data, weighted median FA and MD values were calculated across right and left for all ROIs and tracts. These weighted medians were calculated for both FA and MD modalities. The methodology using multivariate linear regression with Tukey correction described in the within network connectivity analysis was then repeated to assess relationships between the DTI tracts and the groups of interest (PCA, DLB, and CU), while similarly accounting for age and sex effects. We used the CONN functional connectivity toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012) (www.nitrc.orgprojectsconn) to generate between network-level maps for each group. Group-level difference maps (two-sample t-test) were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) at q 0.05, with cluster size corrected for FDR at q  0.05. For the multimodal analysis, we only evaluated associations with regions found to be significant in the previous analysis. Here, univariate linear-regression models were fit to predict within or betweennetwork connectivity as outcome using gray-matter volumes or FDG uptake composites for each network extracted from the same atlas employed in the rsfMRI analysis i.e., Harvard-Oxford Atlas. Univariate linear regression models to predict white-matter structural connectivity as outcome used gray-matter volumes or FDG PET SUVR composite for corresponding regions extracted from the MCALT atlas.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study investigated breakdowns in structural and functional connectivity in Aβ-positive PCA and Aβ-negative DLB. We found disruptions in within-network functional connectivity across a few brain networks, particularly reductions in the visual network for PCA and the cerebellar network for DLB, and altered functional connectivity between multiple networks, specifically with increases in cerebellar-to-dorsal attention and cerebellar-to-sensorimotor connectivity in both disorders. We identified disruptions in structural connectivity only in PCA, particularly degeneration of the parietoccipital white matter, along with posterior thalamic radiations, splenium of corpus collosum, sagittal stratum and the fornix. Overall, PCA showed extensive breakdown in both functional and structural connectivity, while DLB did not demonstrate this effect.\nConsistent with the clinical presentation and patterns of neurodegeneration observed in PCA (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015), the PCA patients showed reduced within-network connectivity in the visual network compared to CU. This finding concurs with previous studies that have found visual network disruptions in PCA (Lehmann et al., 2015;N. A. Singh et al., 2023). We extend these findings by showing complete breakdown of connectivity within the visual network regions, along with an increase in superior lateral occipital cortex-to-occipital pole connectivity, which may indicate a compensatory mechanism to maintain visual processing in response to a reduction in connectivity within the lateral and medial regions of the visual network.\nA previous study also found evidence of a reduction in DMN connectivity in atypical AD phenotypes (Putcha et al., 2022). We extend these findings by showing that both dorsal and ventral DMN show significantly reduced in within-network connectivity compared to DLB and CU. In addition to reduced in visual and dorsal-DMN within-network connectivity, we found a reduction in visual-to-dorsal DMN connectivity, which suggests a possible disruption in receiving input from visual regions (Poerio et al., 2017). There was further extensive between-network connectivity breakdown between the DMN subcomponents, specifically between the dorsal and ventral DMN, implying difficulties in integrating information from DMN network subcomponents (Poerio et al., 2017). There were also significant reductions in within-network connectivity of the medial posterior DMN and an increase in anterior DMN in PCA compared to CU. This finding implies a compensatory mechanism originating from the anterior DMN in response to the reduced connectivity, particularly in the posterior networks. This explanation is supported by the cascading network failure model in typical AD, which postulates the posterior DMN as the location where network failure begins and then shifts processing burden to other systems and prominent hubs (Jones et al., 2016). Together, these findings also suggest that the breakdown of DMN connectivity is a characteristic feature of AD, regardless of the clinical presentation. We did not find disrupted DMN connectivity in DLB, consistent with the fact that our cohort was Aβ-negative, and amyloid plays a key role in DMN disruption. A previous study reported breakdowns in DMN connectivity in Aβ-positive DLB, presumedly related to the presence of AD (Schumacher et al., 2021). However, reduced posterior DMNto-sensorimotor connectivity at the network level was also noted, which may be indicative of the start of disruptions in DMN connectivity in Aβ-negative DLB.\nWe also found reduced within-network connectivity in the sensorimotor network in PCA, with an increase in sensorimotor-to-dorsal DMN connectivity compared to DLB. These findings may indicate an early decline in PCA with possible network reorganization involving the sensorimotor network. Similarly, we found a reduction in within-network connectivity for the dorsal attention network in PCA compared to both DLB and CU and increase in between dorsal attention-to-dorsal DMN connectivity compared to DLB. The dorsal attention network plays a critical role in visuospatial attention and a reduction in connectivity may be related to this impairment in PCA (Katsumi et al., 2023). This observation also concurs with previous studies reporting hypometabolism (Cerami et al., 2015) and flortaucipir PET (Katsumi et al., 2023) uptake in the regions associated with the dorsal attention network in PCA.\nDLB patients only showed a reduction in within-network connectivity in the cerebellar network compared to CU, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of motor function deficits (Yamada et al., 2020) and patterns of neurodegeneration (Colloby et al., 2014) in DLB. At the network level, there was also a reduction in within-network connectivity in the dorsal attention network, which is consistent with the presence of attention deficits in DLB patients (OCallaghan et al., 2021). Further, the slight discrepancy in these two statistical methods may be because the multivariate linear regression models offered more power in estimating the effects of functional connectivity by adjusting for the effect of sex and age.\nWe also found a significant increase in cerebellar-to-dorsal attention and cerebellar-tosensorimotor connectivity in both PCA and DLB compared to CU, with DLB showing greater connectivity. In PCA, this increase may reflect a compensatory mechanism in response to the reduced within-network connectivity in both the dorsal-attention and sensorimotor networks; of note that the cerebellar network showed trends for a reduction in within-network connectivity in PCA. On the other hand, DLB only showed significant functional connectivity alterations in connectivity from the cerebellar network, so this increase in cerebellar-to-dorsal attention and cerebellar-to-sensorimotor connectivity suggests network reorganization to sustain attention and motor functions through the recruitment of the dorsal attention and sensorimotor networks. Furthermore, these findings suggest network reorganization to sustain motor function by increasing crosstalk between the cerebellar and sensorimotor networks in response to reduction in within-network connectivity of the cerebellar network.\nWithin the DLB group, we found no evidence to suggest a significant breakdown in structural connectivity. Previous studies have found degeneration of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Kantarci et al., 2010) and anterior thalamic radiations and the cingulum (Delli Pizzi et al., 2015), but these findings may have been due to the presence of AD copathology.\nIn contrast, PCA showed evidence of extensive structural connectivity breakdown, particularly in the occipital and parietal white-matter, which matches well with whitematter abnormalities previously reported in PCA (Caso et al., 2015;Madhavan et al., 2016;Migliaccio et al., 2012;N. A. Singh et al., 2023). We also found white-matter degeneration in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, perhaps indicative of languagefunction impairments in PCA (Crutch et al., 2013) and in the posterior thalamic radiations. This finding is consistent with the patterns of neurodegeneration in PCA as the posterior thalamic radiations project from the thalamus to the parietal and occipital lobes, regions heavily affected in PCA. Previous studies report that the posterior thalamic radiations are also abnormal in amnestic AD, perhaps implying that it could be a signature of AD (Madhavan et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2015). Similarly, the sagittal stratum, splenium of corpus callosum and the fornix also showed significant degeneration in PCA. The splenium is interconnected with the posterior temporal, parietal and occipital regions, which are heavily affected in PCA. Further, studies show that the splenium is vulnerable in PCA (Madhavan et al., 2016;Yoshida et al., 2004), and its degeneration correlates with visuospatial neglect (Kesayan et al., 2018) and perceptual difficulties (Rudge and Warrington, 1991). The fornix connects the medial temporal lobe with the posterior cortex through the splenium of corpus collosum and has a vital role in episodic memory performance (Alm et al., 2020). Although memory loss is not a core or early feature in PCA, it may develop over time and the medial temporal lobe is commonly mildly affected in PCA (Josephs et al., 2022).\nOur PCA cohort showed the expected, typical patterns of atrophy and hypometabolism (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015;Whitwell et al., 2017;Whitwell et al., 2007). The patterns of hypometabolism observed in our DLB cohort were also consistent with previous studies showing similar patterns to PCA but with greater involvement of the cerebellum and frontal lobe (Kantarci et al., 2021;Whitwell et al., 2017). We did not find any significant graymatter volume loss in DLB which disagrees with previous studies that reported atrophy of regions such as the midbrain, substantia innominata, hypothalamus and cerebellum (Kantarci et al., 2012;Oppedal et al., 2019;Whitwell et al., 2007). We may have lacked power to detect involvement in these regions in our cohort.\nOn comparison of functional connectivity, and volumetric and metabolic neurodegeneration in PCA and DLB, we found weak associations between functional-connectivity breakdown and volumetric neurodegeneration in PCA, while DLB showed weak associations between functional-connectivity breakdown and metabolic neurodegeneration. In PCA, these associations were between the within-network connectivity of the visual network and its corresponding volumetric equivalent, which matches well with the initial and predominant visual deficits (Crutch et al., 2017), along with associations between the within-network connectivity of the dorsal attention network and its corresponding volumetric equivalent, suggestive of a significant influence on visuospatial attention (Katsumi et al., 2023). In DLB, these associations were between the within-network connectivity of the cerebellar network and its corresponding metabolic equivalent, which matches well with the presence of motor deficits in DLB patients (McKeith et al., 2005) and the role of the cerebellar network in governing motor control (Manto et al., 2012). Together, these findings suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PCA and DLB is different, i.e., atrophy correlates with connectivity disruptions in PCA, but DLB connectivity disruptions correlate with hypometabolism. These findings also highlight the existence of a spatial and temporal lag in volumetric modalities in both PCA and DLB, implying the likelihood of functional connectivity disruptions preceding atrophy. Further, no disparate findings in spatial and temporal patterns between connectivity and metabolic modalities were noted in DLB, implying that both functional connectivity disruptions and metabolic changes precede atrophy. Additionally, there were no associations when comparing structural connectivity and volumetric and metabolic neurodegeneration in both PCA and DLB, suggesting that breakdown in regional white-matter structural connectivity is independent of volumetric and metabolic changes. The multimodal associations reported in this study shed light on the differing pathological processes not only between the two disorders but also between the different imaging modalities. Furthermore, these findings highlight the potential of functional connectivity to provide a more fine-grained evaluation of the effect of neurodegeneration on brain mechanisms in the form of reduced and increased network communication and stability.\nStrengths of this study include the consistent neuroimaging protocols and comprehensive clinical evaluations with models that controlled for differences in age and sex. Our recruitment of Aβ-negative DLB patients removed AD confounders from this group. Our findings highlight the stark differences in connectivity within and between multiple functional networks when comparing PCA and DLB, along with the complete absence of structural connectivity breakdown in DLB patients. Further, the multimodal findings shed light on disease mechanisms in these disorders. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size and the absence of longitudinal data to assess how these network changes evolve and how they predict disease progression. Given that we excluded Aβ-positive DLB patients, our results may not generalize to all DLB patients. Overlap in voxels was seen between the DMN subnetworks, visual and fronto-parietal networks, which was inevitable as the parietal and frontal cortices are functionally heterogeneous regions comprising of several specialized areas involved in a variety of brain functions. Another potential limitation was the longer disease duration in the DLB group which could have influenced the severity of the neuroimaging findings. Given this potential limitation, we performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate the relationship between disease duration and within-network functional connectivity. Spearman correlations did not show any significant associations in either PCA (all p values0.99) or DLB (all p values0.5) in any of the brain networks suggesting that disease duration was not an important confounder in our analyses. Furthermore, despite the shorter disease duration, PCA showed extensive functional connectivity disruptions compared to DLB.",

      "text": "These findings suggest that Aβ-positive PCA and Aβ-negative DLB have unique connectivity disruptions, with PCA showing connectivity disruptions across all DMN components and sensorimotor, dorsal-attention and visual networks, and DLB showing disruptions in the cerebellar network only. We also found overlap between both disorders, specifically an increase in connectivity from the cerebellum. Further, the multimodal findings suggest a different underlying pathophysiological mechanism between the two disorders. Together, these findings highlight the connectivity patterns in DLB without the interference of AD pathology. They demonstrate the potential of functional connectivity in providing a more fine-grained evaluation of the effect of neurodegeneration on brain mechanisms, in the form of reduced and increased network communication and stability, and may potentially be translated into diagnostic biomarkers, mechanistic treatment targets, and guiding management strategies these patients.\nin the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, writing of the manuscript or in the decision to submit an article for publication.",

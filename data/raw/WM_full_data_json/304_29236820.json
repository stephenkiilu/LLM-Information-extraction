As the prevalence of this disorder and other forms of dementia is higher in developing countries 2 , it is important to explore the neural correlates of episodic memory in the setting of low education, a situation extremely common among the elderly population in low-and middle-income countries. Hence, understanding the anatomic substrate of memory performance, especially in vulnerable individuals, can help to develop strategies to prevent cognitive decline in this scenario.

      "text": "matter also plays a crucial role. Previous studies have shown that memory function was associated with white matter integrity in the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, the posterior and anterior cingulum 4 the uncinate fasciculus, the dorsal cingulum bundle 5 and the hippocampal part of the cingulum 6 . However, these studies have explored the correlation between episodic memory and white matter integrity in highly-educated individuals, selected under strict criteria from research centers 5,7 . Hence, the role of white matter integrity on episodic memory in community-dwelling elderly with a low educational level remains to be explored.\nAdvanced neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have allowed the study of the integrity of white matter tracts with fair precision 8 . This method is based on the anisotropic property of water molecules, characterized by nonrandom movement when constricted by structures such as the neuron membrane and the myelin sheath. By acquiring a DTI image, it is possible to detect these movements and to establish the directionality using diagonalization to calculate the vectors. Thereafter, these vectors can be used to calculate measures that correlate with white matter integrity, such as the fraction anisotropy (FA) and the mean diffusivity (MD). The former reflects the longitudinal directionality of the water molecules movement, and reduces with white matter microstructural integrity disruption 9 . Conversely, the latter measure reflects the radial directionality, which increases with white matter lesions. These two parameters can be correlated with cognitive performance, enabling us to make inferences about the role of the integrity of white matter on cognitive paradigms, such as episodic memory.\nAlthough the relationship between white matter integrity and episodic memory has been explored in highly-educated individuals, in this study we used DTI to explore the role of white matter integrity on episodic memory performance in a low-educated elderly sample. A high magnetic field 10 and an advanced post-processing approach -whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics -were used to generate a reliable interpretation of multiple DTI analyses 11 . We hypothesized that, in low-educated individuals, episodic memory performance would correlate with the white matter integrity of connection bundles between the medial temporal lobe and frontoparietal regions, similar to that which happens in highly-literate individuals.",

      "text": "The participants were selected from the Pietà study, a community-based investigation on brain aging conducted in Caeté (Minas Gerais state), Brazil 12 . Six hundred thirty-nine individuals, corresponding to 51.1 of the city population aged 75 years were evaluated. The Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais approved this study and all participants or their legally-authorized representatives provided written informed consent. The clinical, functional, neurological and psychiatric status of the participants were established and they were classified into three cognitive performance categories: cognitively healthy, cognitive impairment-no dementia, and dementia. For this study purpose, we included both cognitively healthy and cognitive impairmentno dementia individuals to improve the range of performance in the memory tests, allowing the detection of white matter micro structural changes. Because it was a population-based study, the cognitive impairment-no dementia concept was used instead of mild cognitive impairment. Individuals were considered cognitive impairment-no dementia when, regardless of cognitive complaints by the patient or the informant, objective cognitive impairment was detected in the cognitive assessment 13 . Demented individuals were excluded from this study because our primary aim was to analyze the influence of white matter integrity on cognitive performance in individuals with preserved functional status.",

The BCSB memory test evaluates both visual and verbal memory. It consists of the presentation of 10 simple drawings that are first identified and named. Immediately after, the participant is asked to recall the drawings (incidental encoding). The sheet of paper is then shown again for 30 seconds, the patient is asked to memorize the figures, and recall is requested immediately after. The latter procedure is performed twice, leading to a score for immediate memory and learning. After that, interference activities are performed, namely, the category fluency test (animalsminute) and the clock drawing test. Then, the participant is asked to recall as many items as possible in a delayed recall task. Finally, the participant is confronted with the 10 previously-presented drawings along with 10 distractors, and is asked to recognize the initial drawings. On the other hand, the RAVLT essentially assesses verbal memory. It consists of 15 words read aloud for five consecutive trials (List A), followed by a free-recall test (A1 through A5). After the fifth trial, a new interference list of 15 words is presented (List B) followed by a free-recall test of that list (B1). After that, a free-recall of List A is requested (A6). After a 30-minute delay period filled with distractor activities, the participant is again asked to recall words from List A (A7). Finally, the patient is required to identify List A words from a list of 50 words, which includes Lists A, List B and 20 other words phonemically or semantically related to those of Lists A and B (recognition item).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The study of white matter integrity opens a window to understanding the neural basis of cognition, as connectivity is a major factor that supports cognitive functioning 24 . In the present study, we performed DTI analyses to investigate the neural basis of episodic memory in elderly individuals with low educational attainment. We found significant correlations between the BCSB, a visual-verbal episodic memory test, and the integrity of frontotemporoparietal connection bundles on whole-brain analyses and with the superior longitudinal fasciculus on ROI analyses. Moreover, the BCSB and RAVLT significantly correlated with the hippocampal part of the cingulum integrity bilaterally on ROI analyses.\nEpisodic memory consists of conscious storage and retrieval of information about previous events, which enables a person to remember the past 25 . Traditionally, since the seminal observations relating severe amnesia due to bilateral hippocampectomy 26 neural basis of memory performance demonstrated that other structures besides the Papez circuit are implicated in memory performance such as the parietal regions, precuneus, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex 27 . Apart from cortical involvement, white matter structures also seem to be critical for memory functioning, as lesions in frontoparietal and frontotemporal fasciculi, including the hippocampal part of the cingulum 6 and parahippocampal gyrus 28 , may damage the connections between the prefrontal cortex and posterior regions, leading to memory impairment 5,29 . The present study suggests a possible correlation between a visual-verbal episodic memory test with the integrity of white matter bundles in the brain, especially in the temporal regions and their connections with frontotemporal structures, according to the results from the voxelwise analysis. Goldstein et al. showed a similar finding, correlating a visual memory test with white matter integrity in temporal regions in a highly-educated sample 30 . Furthermore, both the visual-verbal and the verbal memory correlated with the integrity of the hippocampal part of the cingulum in the ROI analyses. This tract includes fibers that link the hippocampal formation with the cingulate cortex, both parts of the default mode network. Connections between those areas have been demonstrated to be important for mnemonic processing 23 and episodic memory performance 4,6 . The present study findings suggest the hippocampal part of the cingulum might also play a role in memory performance in low-educated individuals. In contrast, the right superior longitudinal fasciculus seems to be more relevant in the visual-verbal memory processing, because, in ROI analysis, we only found a significant correlation between the BCSB and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus integrity. Possibly the fact that the superior longitudinal fasciculus has been associated with visual processing 23 , and the strong visual component of the BCSB test, may make them responsible for this finding in only the right hemisphere.\nThe population-based setting and the very low education attainment of the participants allowed the exploration of the relationships between microstructural white matter integrity and episodic memory performance in this context, which is the reality in developing countries. However, the present study has important limitations. We did not control our analyses for gender and white matter lesions burden. Considering that our sample consisted mostly of women with moderate levels of white matter lesions assessed by the Fazekas scale, our findings may apply mainly to individuals with those characteristics. We were unable to perform DTI assessment on all individuals submitted to MRI, which led to a small final sample size. Although relatively common in population-based studies, the drop off in the sample size remained an important limitation for more assertive conclusions. Moreover, because the performance on the RAVLT is influenced by the educational level, there was a floor effect on its performance in the entire sample, with implication on the negative findings regarding the whole-brain analysis. Although important for memory performance, we could not assess the fornix in our study because it is not part of the automated atlas we used and it is difficult to delineate this structure when using the tract-based spatial statistics approach. Furthermore, the different sensitivities of the FA and MD parameters led to few overlaps between the FA and MD findings, which has been described in previous neuroimaging studies 7 and did not impact on the interpretation of the results.\nOne of the main goals of aging research is to understand the causes and the pathophysiology of cognitive decline, especially within the memory domain. Our study suggests that the integrity of white matter bundles that connect frontotemporoparietal regions is important for memory performance in the low-educated elderly, similar to that in the highly-educated elderly. Moreover, we identified possible white matter neural correlates of the BCSB test. Because the correlates were consistent with bundles important for memory processing, we believe that our findings reinforce the role of the BCSB test in the clinical setting as an important tool in the diagnostic workup for Alzheimers disease in individuals with different educational attainments.\nThe vast majority of scientific studies are conducted in high-income countries, where the populations characteristics frequently lack similarity with the low-and middle-income countries, especially considering the educational level and the socioeconomic status. Although the white matter neural correlates of memory have been studied before, most studies were conducted in developed countries 4,5,6 . Our results, although preliminary, contribute to the field of understanding memory processing in the low-educated elderly. We acknowledge that further studies in a broader sample are necessary to confirm our findings and the next step will be to identify the influence of progressive educational strata on the episodic memory white matter neural correlates. The present findings may contribute to future studies in dementia prevention, since keeping the white matter integrity in frontotemporoparietal connection bundles may have a role in memory processing in the low-educated elderly. Controlling for cardiovascular risk factors to keep the integrity of brain connections might be an important intervention tool to be tested in future studies, to analyze its specific role in preventing memory decline in the elderly.",

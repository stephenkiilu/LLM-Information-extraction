    "abstract": "Introduction-Discrepancies between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings and functional rating scales in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be due to symptom heterogeneity, particularly coexisting cognitive-behavioural dysfunction affecting non-motor regions of the brain. Carriers of expansion mutations in the C9orf72 gene, whose motor and cognitive-behavioural symptoms span a range from ALS to frontotemporal dementia, present an opportunity to evaluate the relationship between symptom heterogeneity and DTI changes. Methods-Twenty-eight C9orf72 mutation carriers with varied cognitive and motor symptoms underwent clinical evaluation and DTI imaging. Twenty returned for two or more follow-up evaluations. Each evaluation included motor, executive, and behavioural scales and disease staging using the Kings college staging system (Balendra, 2014). Results-Widespread reduction of white matter integrity occurred in C9orf72 mutation carriers compared to 28 controls. The ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and Kings stage correlated with DTI measures of the corticospinal tract and mid-callosum. Cognitive and behavioural scores correlated with diffusion measures of frontal white matter. Kings stage, but not ALSFRS-R, correlated with anterior callosum DTI measures. Over a 6-month follow-up, DTI changes spread from anterior to posterior, and from deep to superficial subcortical white matter. In C9orf72 carriers with ALS or ALS-FTD, changes in corticospinal tractography measures correlated with changes in ALSFRS-R.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Neuroimaging has been proposed as a biomarker of the progression of upper motor neuron degeneration in ALS, 1,2 but brain imaging findings do not always mirror clinical measures. Such discrepancies may result from clinical scales lacking specificity for decline related to upper, as opposed to lower, motor neuron degeneration. Limitations of the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R 3 ), the most commonly used scale in ALS clinical trials, have led to alternative ALS disease staging systems, 4 such as the Kings college staging system, which was found to be sensitive to disease severity in the early stages of ALS. 5 Heterogeneity of the ALS patient population, particularly for cognitive dysfunction, may also produce neuroimaging changes unrelated to motor dysfunction. The growing recognition of concurrent cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients has led to calls for incorporating cognitive dysfunction into ALS severity scores. 6,7 The need for including a measure of cognitive impairment is particularly acute in ALS patients with expansion mutations in the C9orf72 gene. Carriers of mutations in C9orf72 can present with ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or a mixture of motor and cognitive symptoms. 8-11 ALS patients who carry the C9orf72 mutation have more cortical and subcortical brain atrophy and more diffuse involvement of white matter pathways than patients with sporadic ALS. 1213141516 Some imaging changes resemble those found in FTD patients 17,18 and in cognitively impaired ALS patients without C9orf72 mutations, 15 and thus are likely to reflect concurrent cognitive-behavioural impairment. 12,14 To capture decline in clinical function, we have used a combination of three brief scales -one each for motor, cognitive, and behavioural impairment -that we found useful for following progression of disease longitudinally in C9orf72 mutation carriers. 19 Because carriers of the C9orf72 mutation have varied presentations across these clinical domains, they offer an opportunity to determine whether integrity of specific white matter tracts is associated with function in particular clinical domains. The first goal of this study was to explore the relationship between white matter diffusion measures and the clinical scales for motor, cognitive, and behavioural impairment. The second goal was to understand the trajectory of white matter changes over time by following patients longitudinally. Most patients were able to undergo repeat clinical and imaging evaluations six months later. Patients whose clinical status permitted had follow-up clinical and imaging evaluations one year later (18-month follow-up). The third goal was to evaluate whether DTI measures of the corticospinal tract correlated with the Kings disease stage.",

      "text": "Twenty-eight unrelated C9orf72 gene mutation carriers (hereafter referred to as C9 subjects) and twenty-eight healthy controls gave written, informed consent for protocols that were approved by the NIH Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board. The C9 subjects were participating in a prospective natural history and biomarker study with evaluations that specified MRI imaging at 0, 6, 18, and 30 months (NCT01925196). All C9 subjects had  30 repeats in the C9orf72 gene by testing in clinical laboratories. The number of repeats was not further quantified. All C9 subjects were examined by an experienced neurologist and underwent electromyography and a battery of cognitive testing to determine their clinical diagnosis. The 2015 revised El Escorial criteria 20 was used to diagnose ALS. The Rascovsky criteria was used for diagnosis of possible or greater behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD). 21 Because some subjects met criteria for both ALS and bvFTD, C9 subjects were classified into four groups: 1) C9 asymptomatic, 2) C9 ALS, 3) C9 bvFTD, and 4) C9 ALS-FTD. All healthy controls had a normal neurological examination and normal scores on cognitive screening tests.\nClinical Measures of Disease Severity-Three clinical scores, the ALSFRS-R, letter fluency, and Frontal Behavioural inventory (FBI) were used to grade severity of dysfunction in motor, executive, and behavioural domains, as described in our previous study. 19 The ALSFRS-R is a 48-point scale assessing bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and respiratory function. 3 The FBI is an examiner-delivered 36-item caregiver questionnaire. 22 Items affected by a patients motor dysfunction were excluded, and thus the FBI scores are reported as the percent of the total possible score for each patient. Higher FBI scores indicate greater behavioural impairment. Letter fluency, a measure of executive function, was scored as the total number of correct, non-repeated words generated to three letters, either written or spoken, using different letter sets at follow-up visits. Letter fluency was not tested in patients unable to speak or write.",

      "text": "MRI Acquisition-Multi-slice diffusion weighted images were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner (GE HDX, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with a receive-only, eightchannel head coil using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence with 64 contiguous axial slices (FOV 240X240, Resolution 96X96, 64 axial slices, 2.5mm slice thickness). A total of 80 diffusion volumes were acquired. Diffusion weighting was applied in 70 directions with 10 volumes at b300 smm 2 and 60 volumes at b1100 smm 2 . Ten additional volumes were collected without gradients applied (b0). The b0 and b300 smm 2 volumes were distributed evenly throughout the acquisition, and the DTI protocol was broken up into four scans, each lasting approximately 5 minutes long. 23 A high-resolution T2-weighted image was also acquired for anatomical registration and echo-planar distortion correction (fast spin echo, TETR 100ms7100ms, Resolution 256X256, FOV 240X240mm, 100 axial slices, 1.7mm slice thickness). All patients undergoing scanning had a vital capacity of at least 60 predicted; a pulse oximeter was used to monitor patients with vital capacity below 70, and all had greater than 90 oxygen saturation throughout the scanning session.\nImage processing-The TORTOISE software package (https:science.nichd.nih.gov confluencedisplaynihpdTORTOISE) was used for processing raw diffusion-weighted images, including correcting motion artifacts, eddy current distortion, calculation of the tensor and DTI metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD).\nWhole-brain analysis of participant groups-A voxel-wise comparison of wholebrain FA skeletons of the C9 and control groups was carried out in Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS v1.2, http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl) using the methods of Smith. 24 The most typical subject in the study was chosen by TBSS as the target image for registration. A threshold of 0.2 was used to create the mean FA skeleton. Contrasts were performed using the Randomise tool in FSL (v2.9, 5000 permutations), with gender and age as covariates. Thresholding for significant clusters was determined using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement, corrected for multiple comparisons across space (FWE). Threshold for significance was p  0.001 for group comparisons, and p  0.05 for correlation analyses.\nTract-of-Interest analysis-Fiber tracking was carried out in DTI Studio 25 using methods previously shown to have longitudinal reliability on individual subjects. 26,27 The average FA and MD for whole tracts were obtained for eight tracts of interest: right and left corticospinal tracts (CST), right and left uncinate fasciculus (UNC) and four anatomical segments of the corpus callosum -genu (CCg), pre-motor (CCpm), motor (CCm), and splenium (CCsp). 27,28",

ANCOVA was used to compare FA and MD between controls and the C9 groups with age as a covariate. Dunnetts test was used to compare each C9 diagnostic subgroup to the healthy control group. Pearsons correlation was used to assess the relationship between tractography measures and clinical scores. Spearmans correlation was used to assess relationship of tractography measures to Kings stage.\nAnalysis of longitudinal data-The changes in tractography measures between diagnosis groups (4 C9 diagnoses and controls) were examined using a random coefficient model with intercept and time as random effects. The model was also tested with and without age as a covariate to assess the interaction between diagnosis and time. A significant interaction would indicate that the diagnosis groups had different slopes. The relationship between changes in (or within-subject correlation between) ALSFRS-R and CST diffusion measures was assessed using a mixed model to remove the differences between subjects. 29",

      "text": "At the baseline visit, seven C9 subjects were asymptomatic, eleven had C9 ALS, seven had C9 ALS-FTD, and three had C9 bvFTD (table 1). The asymptomatic C9 carriers were younger than C9 ALS-FTD and bvFTD and healthy controls. Among symptomatic subgroups, the age of symptom onset and disease duration did not differ, but C9 ALS-FTD and bvFTD patients were all male. C9 subjects and controls did not differ in years of education. The ALSFRS-R score was significantly lower in C9 ALS subjects compared to other C9 subjects. The C9 bvFTD and ALS-FTD subjects had lower scores on the MMSE, Letter Fluency, and FBI, consistent with cognitive-behavioural impairment.\nThe cohort that had longitudinal scans consisted of twenty C9 subjects who had two or more follow-up scans.

      "text": "Whole-brain analysis -group differences-At baseline, C9 subjects had widespread reduction of FA in white matter compared to controls, with a frontal predominance (figure 1A). The affected white matter tracts included the rostral and midportions of the corpus callosum, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculi, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and portions of the CST. MD was increased in a more extensive distribution than the changes in FA (figure 1B). However, the splenium of the corpus callosum and occipital subcortical white matter were mostly spared. For the twenty-three healthy controls with longitudinal scans, the whole-brain analysis found no change in FA and MD between scan sessions. In contrast, in the twenty C9 subjects, white matter regions with reduced FA extended both more posteriorly and more superficially into subcortical white matter at the second scan compared to controls (figure 2A, red  scan 1; orange  scan 2). As at baseline, regions of white matter with increased MD had a broader distribution than the regions with increased FA, extending posteriorly and into temporal lobes (figure 2B, bluescan 1; greenscan 2). To determine which subgroups accounted for the group changes, the change in FA and MD of the white matter skeletons in the expanded regions between the two scans was analyzed for individual subjects by ANOVA, with Dunnetts posthoc test. The change in FA was significantly greater in C9 ALS and ALS-FTD than other C9 subgroups and controls (p 0.001). Changes in MD in the expanded area were not different across the C9 diagnostic subgroups (p0.09).",

All symptomatic subgroups had reduced FA in the motor segment of the corpus callosum. FA of the premotor segment of the callosum was reduced in C9 ALS and bvFTD patients. Asymptomatic C9 carriers were not significantly different from controls.\nFor the longitudinal whole-tract measures of FA and MD of the eight tracts-of-interest in the 20 C9 and 23 control subjects, the random coefficient model analysis indicated that intercepts differed between groups, reflecting the differences at baseline, but the coefficients for change over time (slopes) were not significantly different between groups. In C9 ALS patients the CST FA was reduced at baseline and remained low and CST MD was increased at baseline and remained high over follow-up. In C9 bvFTD and ALS-FTD patients, the UNC FA was reduced and UNC MD was increased at baseline, and at follow-up. In C9 asymptomatic subjects values of FA and MD for tracts-of-interest were in the range of healthy controls at both time points (supplementary figure).",

The ALSFRS-R score was correlated with FA values in portions of the CST extending from subcortical white matter to the pons, with a right sided predominance (figure 3A, upper panel). Smaller regions of the right CST MD were correlated with ALSFRS-R. Letter fluency (figure 3B) and FBI scores (figure 3C) correlated with FA and MD values in diffuse white matter regions, largely with a frontal predominance. Affected tracts included the genu of the callosum, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule and anterior thalamic radiations.\nWhole-tract measures for tracts-of-interest and clinical scores for individual patients, pooling observations over all visits, showed that the ALSFRS-R had moderately strong correlations with CST FA and CST MD values and with FA of the motor segment of the callosum. The FBI score was moderately strongly correlated with FA of the right uncinate fasciculus, genu, and premotor segments of the callosum, and with MD of the uncinate and callosal segments (table 3).\nThe within-subject correlation analysis for the 11 C9 ALS and ALS-FTD subjects showed that the correlation between changes in clinical measures and changes in whole-tract measures of the CST was significant, indicating that a decline in the ALSFRS-R score was moderately correlated with reduced CST FA and increased CST MD (table 4, figure 3).\nCorrelations Between Disease stage, Imaging-The modified Kings staging system had moderately strong correlations with CST MD and weak correlations with CST FA and FA motor segment of the callosum (table 3). Kings stage was also weakly correlated with FA and MD of anterior segments of the corpus callosum. These callosal segments were strongly correlated with FBI scores, but not with the ALSFRS-R.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this cohort of C9orf72 mutation carriers with a mixture of motor and cognitive symptoms, the pattern of clinical deficits corresponded to differing patterns of diffusion changes in white matter tracts. This was best appreciated in the whole-brain analysis which showed that, within the extensive distribution of white matter with diffusion alterations in the C9 cohort, different white matter regions were correlated with scores on the ALSFRS-R, fluency testing, and the Frontal Behavioural Inventory. These function-specific patterns were detected in comparisons between the C9 cohort as a whole and healthy controls. The correlation of ALSFRS-R scores with reduced fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tracts and motor segment of the corpus callosum is consistent with previous studies of sporadic ALS patients. 30 These motor tracts were also correlated with the Kings ALS disease stage 4 using the tractography method. The similar correlations are not surprising because the Kings stage can be determined by examining the ALSFRS-R. However, the premise of the Kings stages is that it denotes spreading of neurodegeneration from one region of the nervous system to another. It is interesting that the Kings stage was also weakly associated with diffusion measures of white matter regions correlated with cognitive and behavioral function in C9 patients. 31 This correlation may suggest that degeneration of motor and extramotor regions are inseparable components of disease progression caused by C9orf72 mutations. Although previous studies of C9orf72 ALS patients have also reported alterations in frontal white matter and frequent cognitive impairment in C9 ALS, 12,13 this study extends those findings to show that particular tracts are associated with cognitivebehavioural impairment versus motor impairment. Because C9 cohorts are clinically heterogeneous, a combination of motor and cognitive-behavioural clinical measures is needed to elucidate these specific patterns of white matter disruption.\nWe used complementary analyses to study white matter integrity. The TBSS whole-brain analysis shows voxel-wise differences in white matter skeletons at the group-level. Fiber tracking provides an average diffusion measure for all voxels within a tract-of-interest for individual subjects. The whole-brain analysis detected extension of regions with affected white matter from baseline to 6 months of follow-up. Regions with DTI changes spread from deep to superficial regions of subcortical white matter, suggestive of Wallerian degeneration, and from anterior to posterior white matter. Fiber tracking was unable to detect changes over time in individual C9 subjects that differed from controls. The relatively flat slopes of whole-tract measures over time likely occur because the regions of the tract that become affected between scan intervals are a relatively small portion of each tract, with little effect on the average diffusion measurement for the entire tract. In contrast, TBSS can detect differences between small clusters of white matter voxels. Another difference is that tracts-of-interest must be selected for fiber tracking, whereas the whole-brain analysis includes all white matter, including tracts not easily studied by fiber tracking. Fiber tracking showed differences in tracts-of-interest among the C9 subgroups from the initial scan, which suggests that white matter changes occurred prior to enrolment in the study. In the two C9 subgroups with ALS, fiber tracking showed changes in corticospinal tract FA and MD occurred with decline in ALSFRS-R over follow-up. The finding that, over time, regions of affected white matter spread along an anteriorposterior direction agrees with the hypothesis of rostrocaudal spreading of pathology in FTD. 32 It is less consistent with the hypothesis of corticofugal spread of disease in ALS, from primary motor cortex to adjacent anterior and posterior cortical areas. 33 Although a corticofugal pattern of progression has been supported by cross-sectional imaging studies in sporadic ALS, 34 in this cohort of C9orf72 carriers, the pattern of spread in white matter more closely resembles that proposed for FTD. This resemblance may result from the relative enrichment of slower progressing patients, cognitively impaired patients, and unaffected carriers in the longitudinal scans. As shown in Table 1, there was a higher proportion of C9 ALS patients who were unable to tolerate or return for a follow-up scan due to progression of symptoms. The relatively small sample size, particularly for patient subgroups with different clinical diagnoses, is a limitation of this study. With a sample of only three C9 patients with pure FTD, no strong conclusions about C9 FTD can be made. Subgroup diagnoses were based on meeting clinical criteria. There were too few subjects to consider lesser degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairment. Larger cohorts of ALS patients, with and without C9orf72 mutations and characterized for motor and cognitive function, will be needed to establish that patterns of white matter diffusion changes in particular tracts correspond with clinical diagnoses at the level of individual subjects.\nWhy phenotypic divergence occurs in C9orf72 mutation carriers is not clear. Even within the same family, symptoms of ALS predominate in some individuals and FTD in others. 13 One possibility is that distinct disease initiation sites occur in individuals, with spread of degeneration through axonal tracts. Cortical regions where disease frequently begins may express common developmental genes 35 that make them similarly vulnerable to the molecular pathways disturbed by the C9orf72 mutation. 36 Alternatively, degeneration may occur diffusely in many regions, such that predominant clinical phenotype is determined by the failure of particular critical brain network hubs. 37 Understanding the temporal sequence of involvement of different brain areas will require longitudinal multimodal imaging studies and studies of C9 subjects imaged before and soon after the onset of clinical symptoms.\nFamilial motor neuron disorders present an opportunity to identify imaging changes associated with early disease activity in presymptomatic gene carriers. 38 Determining when disease activity begins is potentially important for deciding the optimal timing for therapy. In Alzheimer disease, for example, CSF proteins and PET imaging findings that can be measured before symptom onset predict progression to cognitive impairment. 39 Although pre-clinical imaging changes have been detected by comparing C9orf72 carriers and noncarriers within the same family 40 and in large cohorts of asymptomatic carriers of FTD genes, 11 we were unable to detect white matter changes at an individual level in this cohort of asymptomatic, unrelated C9orf72 mutation carriers. This group was almost a decade younger than C9 ALS, and none became symptomatic during the study.\nThis study showed the potential for diffusion imaging measures to serve as biomarkers of disease progression in C9orf72 mutation carriers, measuring disease severity for motor, cognitive, and behavioural function. The Kings ALS disease stages 4 correlated with corticospinal tract diffusion measures to a similar extent as the ALSFRS-R. However, unlike the ALSFRS-R, where scores can drop because of increased functional severity within the same segment, the Kings stages are based on signs and symptoms indicative that disease has spread to involve additional regions of the central nervous system. In C9orf72 carriers with heterogeneous clinical presentations, Kings stages were also weakly correlated with diffusion measures of non-motor tracts, suggesting that stages may be an indicator of more spatially widespread degeneration. The finding that diffusion changes could be detected over six months is encouraging that DTI measures can contribute information about disease progression that would be relevant on the timescale of a clinical trial. However, clear spread of white matter changes over time was only detected in group-level analyses. Additional work is needed to develop reliable imaging measures that can measure disease progression at the level of individual patients.",

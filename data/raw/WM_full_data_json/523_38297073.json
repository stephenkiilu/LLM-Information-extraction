    "Joint diffusional kurtosis magnetic resonance imaging analysis of white matter and the thalamus to identify subcortical ischemic vascular disease": {
      "text": "Min-Chien Tu 1,2 , Sheng-Min Huang 3 , Yen-Hsuan Hsu 4,5 , Jir-Jei Yang 6 , Chien-Yuan Lin 7  Li-Wei Kuo 3,8 Identifying subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) in older adults is important but challenging. Growing evidence suggests that diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) can detect SIVD-relevant microstructural pathology, and a systematic assessment of the discriminant power of DKI metrics in various brain tissue microstructures is urgently needed. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the value of DKI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics in detecting early-stage SIVD by combining multiple diffusion metrics, analysis strategies, and clinical-radiological constraints. This prospective study compared DKI with diffusivity and macroscopic imaging evaluations across the aging spectrum including SIVD, Alzheimers disease (AD), and cognitively normal (NC) groups. Using a white matter atlas and segregated thalamus analysis with considerations of the pre-identified macroscopic pathology, the most effective diffusion metrics were selected and then examined using multiple clinical-radiological constraints in a two-group or three-group paradigm. A total of 122 participants (mean age, 74.6  7.38 years, 72 women) including 42 with SIVD, 50 with AD, and 30 NC were evaluated. Fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis, and radial kurtosis were critical metrics in detecting early-stage SIVD. The optimal selection of diffusion metrics showed 84.4-100 correct classification of the results in a three-group paradigm, with an area under the curve of .909-.987 in a two-group paradigm related to SIVD detection (all P  .001). We therefore concluded that greatly resilient to the effect of pre-identified macroscopic pathology, the combination of DKIDTI metrics showed preferable performance in identifying early-stage SIVD among adults across the aging spectrum.\nSubcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is a common subtype of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in which cerebral vascular pathologies are spatially and pathologically stratified 1 . Identifying SIVD in older adults is important but challenging 2 . While white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and lacunes within subcortical regions are pathognomonic in SIVD 1 , these imaging features are also observed in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) 3 and cognitively normal (NC) older adults 4 . To improve the detectability, exploring the value of advanced neuroimaging techniques is needed from both therapeutic and prognostic perspectives. Current diagnostic guidelines for dementia mostly describe neuroimaging features for individual dementia subtypes separately. Therefore, an optimized tool to assist in decision-making is needed, as clinicians often consider a list of differential diagnoses simultaneously in real-world practice. Among neuroimaging techniques, structural MRI has been shown to potentially be able to identify the presence of VCI among patients with dementia, and especially among those with AD 567 . Compared to VCI, the early detection of SIVD is even more challenging, as the macroscopic plethora of WMHs andor lacunes generally evolve later. Recently, diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) has been used to quantify microstructural changes, and it has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of earlystage SIVD 8910 . To date, most DKI studies have focused on comparing cerebral microstructural changes among SIVD subgroups 9 or with controls 10 , but few have compared SIVD with other dementia subtypes 8 . Moreover, it remains unclear which DKI metrics have the best performance in detecting SIVD amongst the aging spectrum. Importantly, the statistical power for differential diagnostics that is pivotal for clinical drug trials should be optimized by characterizing the underlying neurobiological heterogeneity 11 . Given that the efficacy of DKI metrics can vary according to the targeted brain regions, macroscopic pathology, and clinical constraints, this study aimed to (i) investigate the diagnostic ability of DKI through two kinds of analytic strategies, (ii) validate the results either by considering multiple clinical constraints indicative of the very early stage of SIVD, or the effect driven by macroscopic pathology, and (iii) determine the optimal diffusion metrics to detect SIVD with a two-group or three-group paradigm.",

At first glance, THA generally had a lower correct classification rate than WMA, but the trend among the performance of various diffusional kurtosis metrics was similar to that in WMA. Compared to correct classification by Scheltens scale (72.1) and segregated WMH volume (63.9), the use of mean kurtosis metrics in overall WMA achieved the highest correct classification rate (77.9). Generally, FA showed higher correct classification rates than kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA) in all constraints except CDR. MK showed incrementally higher classification rates over MD in all cases (overall and three constraints) for both WMA and THA analyses. For both diffusivity and kurtosis, the mean and radial metrics generally showed higher correct classification rates than the axial metrics. Since KFA, D axial , and K axial showed relatively low correct classification rates, they were excluded from comparisons of discrimination analyses using multiple metrics. Given a generally better performance in the measure of saving area of WMHs than the current measure aimed at region free from WMH, the statistical differences are not benefited by the process of WMH regional exclusion (Supplementary Table S1).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The current study shows the complementary value of using both diffusivity and kurtosis metrics. FA and DKI metrics in average THA could differentiate SIVD from AD and NC, and so could DKI metrics in average WMA. The selection of metrics was evaluated based on two analysis strategies (WMA and THA) and clinical-radiological constraints indicative of the very early stage of SIVD (e.g., WMH volume and number of lacunes). In the three-group discriminant analysis, we showed the power of DKIDTI metrics in identifying SIVD. The optimal combination of metrics, i.e., MK, K radial , and FA, yielded the highest correct classification rate. This combination was then validated using two-group comparisons via ROC analysis, which showed promising results overall.\nIn addition, several WMA and THA hubs with significant effects in predicting global cognition anatomically overlapped with Papez and frontal-subcortical circuits, supporting the robustness of the diffusion metrics in exploring cognitive and neuronal substrates.\nOur findings demonstrated that both DKI and DTI metrics provided better classification accuracy than Scheltens scale and segmented WMH volume. In average ROI analysis, MK performed incrementally better than MD across various clinical constraints. This corroborates the sensitivity inherited by the non-Gaussian premise assumption in DKI. It was also noticeable that the radial components of both kurtosis and diffusivity generally outperformed their axial components in terms of classification accuracy. Previous studies have shown that MK and K radial exhibited a greater extent and degree of SIVD-AD differences than K axial within the WM 12 and thalamus 8 . Another report has shown that radial metrics could possess higher sensitivity in detecting AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal individuals 13 . As consistent with previous reports, the radial metrics could provide higher sensitivity in detecting the microstructural alterations especially in SIVD and AD. Hypothetically, liquefaction within the halo of lacunarmicro-infarcts and myelin pallor within WMHs 14 could contribute to the geometrical variability of cerebral microstructures. We speculate that the attenuated discriminant power of K axial may be due to diverse diffusing axis determination in the presence of neuronal and or interstitial dispersion from vascular insults. This does not negate the importance of the axial components of kurtosis and diffusivity, and both K axial and D axial in our results could still differentiate SIVD or AD from NC. The importance of axial components was also suggested in a previously published AD cohort 15 . It is also worth mentioning that the classification rates of MK and MD improved remarkably with WMHs and lacunes as constraints in the thalamus rather than in WM. This effect of WMHs and lacunes could be associated with differences in regional vulnerability to vascular burden between WM and the thalamus, or the better inherited power of WMA than THA due to higher structural coherence within WM than the thalamus. Of note, independent evidence supports a viewpoint that the degree of DKI changes in response to ischemia differs according to the gray-white matter proportion of the affected regions 16 .\nAfter controlling for demographics and macroscopic pathology including WMHs and lacunes, FA and DKI metrics enhanced SIVD-AD and SIVD-NC contrasts in the average THA, and DKI metrics solely enhanced SIVD-NC contrast in the average WMA. Aside from the reported role of FA in detecting vascular dementia 6 , our results further indicate that DKI is potentially resilient to the overall effect from WMHs and lacunes. It is also worth mentioning that DTI metrics enhanced AD-NC contrast in the average THA, demonstrating the complementary value of DKI and DTI metrics. KFA and FA had similar tendencies in most comparisons, but KFA showed a lower correct classification rate than FA. As the DKI metrics were derived from a WMA driven by FA, the possibility of pseudo-normalization of KFA values when the quantification process involves crossing fibers as documented issues in FA calculations should be considered 17 . The numeric accuracy of KFA may also have been overwhelmed since WM and microstructure coherence was already compromised by vascular burden, and hence it may be a less promising metric in terms of test-retest reliability 10 and statistical power 9 .\nIn this study, we used a WMA free from WMHs while considering WMHs and lacunes as statistical covariates, which is a two-tier concept. First, measurements focusing on normal-appearing WM could provide information presumably corresponding to pathological alterations at the very early stage of SIVD. Second, the additional statistical considerations reduced the effect driven by vascular pathology, which had already been identified macroscopically and may have had an indirect effect due to Wallerian degeneration. Of note, our results bridge the published findings 8,18 by highlighting that a joint analysis strategy is a favorable solution for constructing a dementia classifier across the aging spectrum. We consider that the joint analysis strategy integrating both gray and WM is an informative ensemble which can be used to stratify the subtype of dementia across the aging spectrum. This also mirrors the regionaltissue vulnerability inherently associated with individual dementia subtypes. As we only investigated two dementia subtypes and cognitively normal older adults, identifying dementia subtypes other than SIVD or AD falls beyond the scope of discussion.\nOur results connect neuronal substrates associated with global cognition to some specific WM hubs, including the genu of the corpus callosum and cingulum of the right hemisphere, and the bilateral superior corona radiata. In addition, THA delineated a pervasive pattern scattered across multiple thalamic nuclei. The overall hubs identified in this study considerably overlapped with landmarks belonging to the Papez circuit or frontal-subcortical circuit 19 . As the interplay between these two circuits plays a critical role in harmonizing global cognition 19 , using diffusional kurtosis metrics could provide additional value in exploring neuronal substrates critical for cognition. In addition, the current metrics exhibit pervasive correlations with the HIS, and the significance remains in considering demographics and indices of cerebral small vessel disease. This corroborates that the diffusional kurtosis metrics can be regarded as potential biomarkers that mirror the composite vascular risk in the aging spectrum. The strength of this study is the integration of WMA and THA analysis strategies with several clinicalradiological constraints targeting the very early stage of SIVD. Diffusion metrics were derived and compared with macroscopic pathology including WMHs and lacunes, and the results showed that combining DKI and DTI metrics could provide robust differential power and resilience to predefined vascular lesions. Moreover, the optimal combination of diffusion metrics showed robust performance in two-or three-group comparisons, suggesting its potential for clinical applications. There are also several limitations to the study. Not all dementia subtypes were included, and the prevalence of dementia subtypes varies across medical settings. Including more dementia subtypes in future studies may provide an opportunity to investigate the robustness and improve the optimal selection of diffusion metrics. In addition, the insignificant differences of diffusional kurtosis metrics between AD and NC within WM could be related to the excluding the effect of WMHs by both imaging processing and statistics. Since the effect of WMHs has been minimized, we believe that the diffusion metrics used in this study provide a reliable reference for future application in differential diagnostics.\nIn conclusion, the current study investigates the sensitivity and resilience of diffusion metrics for macroscopic vascular lesions that are pathognomonic to SIVD. The optimal combination of diffusion metrics included MK, K radial , and FA, which could effectively differentiate SIVD from other groups across the aging spectrum in both WMA and THA strategies (AUC  0.9). The joint analysis strategy showed the best performance. The additional and complementary values of the diffusion metrics were comprehensively explored as hubs for global cognition identified and anatomically overlapped with Papez and frontal-subcortical circuits.",

After initial alignment, tissue segmentation was performed on the roughly-aligned T1 image to identify white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF voxels were set to zero to generate the CSF-free T1 image. The same masking process was performed on the MNI T1 template to generate the CSF-free MNI T1 template. After this process, a two-step non-linear warping process was employed for better co-registration outcome. First, the CSF-free 3D-T1 image was co-registered to the CSF-free MNI T1 template by using non-linear co-registration, and this output non-linear warping transformation was then applied on the roughly-aligned 3D-T1 images to generate the first warped 3D-T1 image. The first warped 3D-T1 image was then non-linearly co-registered to the MNI T1 template again to form the final aligned 3D-T1 image.

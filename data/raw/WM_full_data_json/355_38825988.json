    "abstract": "Progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) is a 4R tauopathy characterized by difficulties with motor speech planning. Neurodegeneration in PAOS targets the premotor cortex, particularly the supplementary motor area (SMA), with degeneration of white matter (WM) tracts connecting premotor and motor cortices and Brocas area observed on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We aimed to assess flortaucipir uptake across speech-language-related WM tracts identified using DTI tractography in PAOS. Twenty-two patients with PAOS and 26 matched healthy controls were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG) and underwent MRI and flortaucipir-PET. The patient population included patients with primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and non-fluent variantagrammatic primary progressive aphasia (agPPA). Flortaucipir PET scans and DTI were coregistered using rigid registration with a mutual information cost function in subject space. Alignments between DTI and flortaucipir PET were inspected in all cases. Whole-brain tractography was calculated using deterministic algorithms by a tractography reconstruction tool (DSI-studio) and specific tracts were identified using an automatic fiber tracking atlasbased method. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were averaged across the frontal aslant tract, arcuate fasciculi, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculi, as well as the SMA commissural fibers. Reduced FA (p  .0001) and elevated flortaucipir SUVR (p  .0012) were observed in PAOS cases compared to controls across all combined WM tracts.

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) is a disorder of speech motor planning or programming that affects the production of speech (Duffy, 2006;Josephs et al., 2012) and most commonly results from a four-repeat tauopathy (4RT) (Josephs et al., 2021). Patients with PAOS can present with apraxia of speech as the sole presenting feature named primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS), or can present with concomitant agrammatic aphasia (Josephs et al., 2012(Josephs et al., , 2013)); the latter patients with aphasia have also been diagnosed with the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (agPPA) (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). Patients with PAOS show right, left or bilateral frontal gray matter (GM) loss, including the lateral premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), with additional involvement of Brocas area in those patients with agrammatic aphasia, as well as right, left or bilateral frontal white matter (WM) degeneration (Botha et al., 2015;Caso et al., 2014;Josephs et al., 2013). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography have been useful imaging technologies for finding abnormal diffusion patterns in PAOS tracts from the SMA to the putamen, prefrontal cortex, Brocas area (frontal aslant tract FAT) and motor cortex, with the greatest abnormalities observed closest to the SMA (Valls Carbo et al., 2022). DTI studies have also identified the involvement of the FAT in nfvPPA (Galantucci et al., 2011;Mandelli et al., 2014).\nTau deposition in the brain can now be imaged using PET ligands, such as flortaucipir, which were developed to bind to paired helical filament tau in Alzheimers disease (AD) (Barthel, 2020;Jie et al., 2021;Liang et al., 2014). Flortaucipir PET has been extensively used to noninvasively determine the degree of tau burden in AD (Jack Jr et al., 2018) with good correlations observed between flortaucipir uptake and tau burden in AD (Lowe et al., 2020). Flortaucipir PET also shows elevated uptake in disease-relevant regions in 4RT (Whitwell et al., 2020) with studies observing correlations between flortaucipir uptake and 4RT burden at autopsy (Ghirelli et al., 2020;Josephs et al., 2016;McMillan et al., 2016), even though autoradiographic studies have found little binding of flortaucipir to 4RT (Lowe et al., 2016(Lowe et al., , 2020)). Mild flortaucipir PET uptake has been observed in the SMA, motor cortex, and Brocas area in PAOS (Utianski et al., 2021), with evidence that uptake increases over time in these regions (Utianski et al., 2020). Mild frontal uptake has also been observed in patients with nfvPPA (Cho et al., 2019;Josephs et al., 2018;Tsai et al., 2019). However, flortaucipir uptake in these studies is predominantly observed in the WM rather than the GM. This could support off-target contributions to the signal or could reflect the fact that tau deposition is observed within WM tracts in 4RT. To date there is a limited understanding on tau aggregation across different WM regions in PAOS. Understanding how tau is distributed across circuits involving speech and language is particularly important to help guide future treatment strategies and to develop appropriate disease biomarkers in PAOS.\nThe main goals of this study were two-fold: (1) to evaluate whether flortaucipir uptake occurs in WM tracts in PAOS patients by using a multimodal approach of registering the DTI and tau PET and\n(2) to determine how well DTI metrics and FTP uptake from WM tracts differentiate PAOS from controls.\nthe Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Battery (26) and the Hoehn and Yahr scale (score of 0). Two PAOS patients with extreme structural brain pathology were excluded from this study, due to inaccuracies of the automatic segmentation, low FA, and tracking failure.\nTherefore, the final number of analyzed patients with PAOS was 20.\nOf the 20 PAOS patients, 9 (45) had PPAOS and 11 (55) had agPPA. Details of apraxia of speech and aphasia severity are given on Table 1. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients.",

      "text": "The speech and language evaluation included the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale-version-3 (ASRSv3) (Duffy et al., 2023;Strand et al., 2014) and the Articulatory Error Score (AES) assessment (Utianski et al., 2021) to assess apraxia of speech, and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) to assess aphasia (Kertesz, 2022). Patients were diagnosed with PAOS if they had evidence of PAOS either with or without aphasia. The neurologic testing was conducted by a behavioral neurologist (KAJHB) and included assessments to characterize general cognitive ability using the MoCA (Nasreddine et al., 2005), parkinsonism using the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored version of the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale motor subsection (MDS-UPDRS III) (Goetz et al., 2008), and ideomotor apraxia using the apraxia subtest of the WAB praxis (Kertesz, 2022).\nApraxia of speech (AOS) severity was rated with a five-point scale (0  normal-no evidence of AOS; 1  mild AOS; 2  moderate AOS; 3  marked AOS; and 4  severe AOS), independent of the ASRS score (Strand et al., 2014). The severity of functional communication impairment was also measured with the communicative participation item bank (CPIB) short form test. The CPIB scores are reported as Tscores where 50  the mean of the calibration sample and standard deviation  10 ( Baylor et al., 2017). Images were corrected for head motion, eddy current, and susceptibility artifact distortions using standard algorithms extensively described in the literature (Andersson  Sotiropoulos, 2016;Andersson et al., 2018). The b-table was checked by an automatic quality control routine to ensure its accuracy (Schilling et al., 2019). The accuracy and reliability of the diffusion data were also checked by incorporated algorithms (Yeh, Zaydan, et al., 2019). As part of the imaging protocol, each patient in this cohort had imaging sequences T2FLAIR to evaluate for WM hyperintensities andor cortical infarcts; none of the patients in this study showed significant vascular burden.",

      "text": "All PET scans were acquired using PETCT scanners (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode. An intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370 MBq (range 333-407 MBq) of 18F flortaucipir was administered, followed by a 20-min PET acquisition performed from 80 to 100 min after injection. Twenty-minute late-uptake PET scans consisted of four, five-minute dynamic frames following a low-dose CT image obtained for attenuation correction.\nCorrections for attenuation, scatter, and random corrections were applied. PET sinograms were iteratively reconstructed into a 256 mm FOV. The original voxel size was 1.0 mm, and the slice thickness was 3.3 mm, which was further resampled to 0.5 mm isotropic. The four individual frames of each dynamic series were coregistered before averaged to create a 20-min mean summed image that was used for analysis. All voxels in the summed images were normalized to the cerebellar crus gray matter to create a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images which were further adjusted using a two-compartment partial volume correction approach using in-house software (Meltzer et al., 1990;Schwarz et al., 2019). To understand the distribution of flortaucipir uptake, SPM12 (fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspmsoftwarespm12)\nwas used to perform voxel-level comparisons of flortaucipir SUVR images between PAOS participants and controls, using gender and age at scan as covariates. Briefly, all PET images were registered to the patients MPRAGE and normalized to the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) using parameters from the MPRAGE normalization. Template space SUVR images were smoothed at 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Results were assessed uncorrected for multiple comparison at p  .001.",

The number of seed points was manually selected based on a balance given by input data and an optimal number of the tract obtained during visual inspections on each reconstruction. Previously described criteria were applied for selecting the number of optimal seed points (Cheng et al., 2012;Zajac et al., 2017).\nAn average of 500,000 seeds were placed with a distance voxel tolerance of 16 mm as performed before (Gatto, Carlos, et al., 2023;Gatto, Martin, et al., 2023;Gatto et al., 2024). Whole-brain deterministic fiber tracking algorithms with augmented tracking strategies to improve reproducibility were calculated (Yeh et al., 2013). Distorted tract or false connections were automatically removed using a topology-informed pruning algorithm (Yeh, Panesar, et al., 2019).\nRegions where FA was below 0.2 were automatically removed as they were unable to track. Anisotropy and angular threshold, as well as step size, were automatically selected. An anatomical tractography atlas in the DSI studio was used to map all tracts and seeding regions were placed using preestablished WM probabilistic areas (Yeh et al., 2018). Tracks with a length shorter than 3 mm or longer than 500 mm were discarded.\nDue to their role in different speech and language functions, a total of six WM tracts were assessed (Figure 1): (1) the arcuate fasciculus (AF) (Chenausky et al., 2020); (2) the FAT (Catani et al., 2013;Dick et al., 2019), (3) the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (Almairac et al., 2015), (4) Middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (Luo et al., 2020), and (5) inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Shin et al., 2019). Due to its important role in PAOS, a commissural tract connecting left and right SMA (6) end-to-end fibers was also included in our analysis (Valls Carbo et al., 2022). DTI values and flortaucipir SUVR were extracted for each tract on the right (R) and left (L) sides of the brain. To account for the DTI and Tau-PET measurements in the overall WM and SMA commissural tracks, an averaged value across all the tracts was generated (meta-ROIs) (Figure 1).",

The selected GM regions were: (1) left supramarginal gyrus,\n(2) left angular gyrus, (3) left frontal inferior pars triangularis, (4) left frontal inferior pars opercularis, and (5) left superior temporal gyrus.\nAdditionally, we added the right and left SMA involved in abnormal projections in the context of PAOS and aphasia (Valls Carbo et al., 2022).",

In the flortaucipir SUVR comparisons, the left and right Arcuatus Fasciculus (AF) ( p  .03 and p  .04), left FAT ( p  .04), left IFOF (p  .05), and SMA commissural fibers ( p  .0001) showed increased uptake in PAOS compared to controls (Figure 2b). These results survived correction for multiple comparisons (Table S1).\nThe WM meta-ROI values from DTI tractography differed between PAOS and controls for FA (p  .0002), MD (p  .02), and flortaucipir PET SUVR ( p  .004) (Figure 3a). These group differences showed greater significance when the SMA was included in the meta-ROIs ( p  .0001 for FA, p  .0003 for MD, and p  .001 for flortaucipir SUVR; Figure 3b).\nThe PAOS cohort showed flortaucipir uptake throughout the frontal WM compared to controls in the voxel-based analysis, with greater involvement of the left hemisphere (Figure S1).\nThe AUROC analysis showed that optimum differentiation of PAOS and controls with flortaucipir SUVR was obtained with the SMA commissural fibers (AUROC  0.97) (Table 2). The SMA commissural fibers also outperformed the WM META-ROI which provided an AUROC of 0.77 (Table 3). However, the AUROCs obtained with FA and MD were on average greater than those obtained with SUVR across all tracts, with excellent differentiation of PAOS and controls with these DTI modalities (Table 2). For example, the left AF was able to differentiate PAOS and controls with an AUROC of 0.99 for FA and 0.95 for MD, and FA from the SMA commissural fibers provided an AUROC of 0.95.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Our study showed that it is possible to measure flortaucipir PET uptake from brain WM tracts derived from DTI-based tractography, and that flortaucipir uptake was elevated in disease-related WM tracts in PAOS.\nWM tracts such as the AF and FAT play a pivotal role in language function (Dick et al., 2019;Ivanova et al., 2021) et al., 2022;Valls Carbo et al., 2022;Wilson et al., 2012). Other WM tracts also play an important role in speech and language, such as the IFOF which subserves language semantics (Almairac et al., 2015), and the ILF, which may be sensitive to the gradual onset of semantic and lexical access difficulties (Herbet et al., 2018). We observed abnormalities in FA and MD across all these tracts in PAOS compared to controls, demonstrating widespread disruption throughout the language network. Indeed, many of our PAOS patients had agrammatic aphasia in addition to AOS, and previous studies have similarly observed diffusion abnormalities in the FAT, AF, IFOF, and ILF in patients with nfvPPA (Agosta et al., 2015;Mandelli et al., 2014). We also observed abnormalities in FA and MD in the SMA commissural fibers in PAOS. We have previously shown that reduced FA in SMA tracts, including the commissural fibers, is associated with AOS severity (Valls Carbo et al., 2022). The MLF was relatively less affected than the other WM tracts, which is concordant with the fact that this tract is more associated with deficits in naming and word comprehension, rather than articulation or fluency (Luo et al., 2020). Generally, our DTI analysis showed an FA decrease and MD increase across WM tracts more predominantly located on the left side of the brain consistent with language lateralization.\nIn contrast to the widespread DTI abnormalities in PAOS, flortaucipir uptake was observed only in the AF, FAT, left IFOF, and SMA commissural fibers, with the strongest differences from controls observed in the SMA commissural fibers likely reflecting the fact that AOS severity was worse than aphasia severity in our cohort. We did not observe elevated flortaucipir uptake in the temporal lobe tracts, including the ILF and MLF, or the right IFOF. This is concordant with previous flortaucipir studies where uptake is primarily observed in the frontal WM in PAOS and nfvPPA cohorts, although we demonstrate for the first time that uptake is observed in specific frontal lobe WM tracts (Cho et al., 2019;Josephs et al., 2018;Tsai et al., 2019;Utianski et al., 2018). Our voxel-level comparison similarly showed flortaucipir PET uptake in the frontal WM with sparing of the temporal lobes. The deep WM was, however, relatively spared suggesting a lack of flortaucipir uptake in deep components of some of these tracts. It has been hypothesized that tau, and subsequent degeneration, spread from a disease epicenter through highly connected brain regions in neurodegenerative disease, (Franzmeier et al., 2020;Sintini et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2012) with spread across the speech language network in nfvPPA and PAOS (Pascual et al., 2020;Sintini et al., 2022). The fact that we observed degeneration of temporal lobe WM tracts in the absence of flortaucipir uptake could suggest that tau deposition in the frontal tracts of the speech-language network can cause widespread degeneration along connected tracts within the network. Indeed, focal flortaucipir uptake in another 4R tauopathy is associated with the degeneration of distally connected WM tracts (Sintini et al., 2019). It is also possible, however, that breakdowns in diffusivity could precede tau deposition or that diffusion tractography is more sensitive to early microstructural changes in WM compared to flortaucipir PET. The latter possibility is supported by our AUROC analysis demonstrating the superior performance of FA and MD for group separation compared to flortaucipir uptake. Flortaucipir may also be limited in its capability to bind to 4RT (Whitwell, 2018), and has issues with off-target binding (Baker et al., 2019;Lemoine et al., 2018;Lowe et al., 2016;Marquié et al., 2015;Sander et al., 2016) and, hence, needs additional consideration when it is used in PAOS (Josephs et al., 2022). Moreover, previous studies in patients with 4R tauopathy found a marginal correlation between flourtaucipir uptake and astrocytic lesion in isolated deep gray matter regions, as well as in astrocytic plaques (Josephs et al., 2022;McMillan et al., 2016). Future studies with ligands that show improved binding to 4RT will be needed to validate our findings and further investigate the relationships between the spread of tau and WM tract degeneration.\nOptimum differentiation of PAOS and controls was achieved with FA measurements across several WM tracts, including the AF, FAT, and SMA commissural fibers (AUROCs 0.95). Moreover, AUR-OCs from WM flortaucipir PET uptake in the SMA commissural fibers also provided excellent differentiation, with an AUROC of 0.97. Further, we generated a WM meta-ROI by averaging values across all assessed WM tracts. These meta-ROIs performed reasonably well for differentiating PAOS and controls. We also specifically assessed the speech and language network (Sonty et al., 2003(Sonty et al., , 2007) ) by assessing WM tracts that connect key regionsnodes in the network. Statistically significant differences between PAOS and controls were observed in terms of FA, MD, and flortaucipir SUVR when nodes within the language network were utilized. The addition of the SMA nodes to the network improved group differences, implying the importance of the combined speech and language network (SNL) analysis as part of a broader and dynamic process altered in this disease.\nTo date, this study is unique in combining flortaucipir PET and DTI in a PAOS cohort and assessing flortaucipir uptake within WM tracts. Moreover, one of the main strengths of this study is our strategy to improve the differentiation of flortaucipir SUVRs based on the WM region specifically affected by this disease. However, as mentioned above, it is still unknown whether flortaucipir binds to 4RT in tauopathies such as PAOS. Previous studies have also shown that flortaucipir has limitations in the representation of neuropathological assessment of tau burden in brain regions with low tau, like atypical AD cases (Gatto, Carlos, et al., 2023;Gatto, Martin, et al., 2023). On a technical note, the coregistration of different imaging modalities imposes limitations and technical challenges, particularly considering a spatio-temporal approximation of two different physical events; one determined by the velocity of water diffusion and a second based on the radioactive decay signal from a molecular ligand. In addition, spatial coregistration between dMRI and flortaucipir PET is also limited by structural and single-shot, echo-planer imaging (EPI) distortions\ngiven by the lasting effect of the disease on the cerebral tissue. In addition, this study was centered on a relatively limited number of patients. The application of DTI to study complex tracts can also be limited by the number of crossing fibers, limiting their tractography reconstruction and the extraction of accurate parameters. Our future line of work will include personalized prediction of regional tau burden based on individual connectivity (rather than group-level analysis) and investigation using longitudinal DTI and flortaucipir PET to establish an accurate prediction of the structural evolution of PAOS.",

Understanding the relationship between tau deposition and WM tract degeneration will be essential to better target future therapeutics and to develop better disease biomarkers in these patients.",

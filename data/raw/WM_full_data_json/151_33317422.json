    "abstract": "Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with language therapy, improves language-therapy outcomes in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). However, no studies show whether white-matter integrity predicts language therapy or tDCS effects in PPA. Objective: We aimed to determine whether white-matter integrity, measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), predicts written namingspelling language therapy effects (letter accuracy on trained and untrained words) with and without tDCS over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in PPA. Methods: Thirty-nine participants with PPA were randomly assigned to tDCS or sham condition, coupled with language therapy for 15 daily sessions. White-matter integrity was measured by mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in DTI scans before therapy. Written naming outcomes were evaluated before, immediately after, two weeks and two months post-therapy. To assess tDCS treatment effect, we used a mixed effects model with treatment evaluation and time interaction. We considered a forward model selection approach to identify brain regionsfasciculi of which white matter integrity can predict improvement in performance of word naming. Results: Both sham and tDCS groups significantly improved in trained items immediately after and at two months post-therapy. Improvement in the tDCS group was greater and generalized to untrained words. White-matter integrity of ventral language pathways predicted tDCS effects in trained items whereas white-matter integrity of dorsal language pathways predicted tDCS effects in untrained items.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The emergence of neuromodulation techniques-especially transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-has provided tools to augment language rehabilitation effects in poststroke aphasia 1 and recently in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) 23456 . In neurodegenerative syndromes without pharmacological agents, there is a great need for treatments that maintain treatment outcomes for as long as possible. In PPA, patients primarily show language impairments. In recent years, studies of tDCS in PPA by different groups, including ours 2 , have shown significant augmentative tDCS effects in several language functions, such as oral naming, spelling, and story-telling 34567 .\nIn our randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover design clinical trial of a tDCS intervention in 36 people with PPA 2 , electrical stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), concurrent with lexical retrieval language therapy targeting written naming, significantly improved language therapy outcomes (letter accuracy) more than language therapy (written namingspelling) alone (sham condition). In patients who did improve, therapy gains were sustained up to two months and generalized to untrained items. Given the variability in response to tDCS, the question of who may benefit from tDCS becomes even more pertinent for future interventions, especially from a clinical perspective.\nIn previous studies we identified cognitive, language and volumetric (gray matter) parameters that significantly predicted language therapy effects, as well as additional tDCS effects, in a written namingspelling treatment in PPA 8,9 . In the present study we aimed to determine whether white-matter integrity is associated with tDCS and language therapy effects in PPA.",

    "White matter integrity and language outcomes in aphasia": {
      "text": "In the language domain, white-matter structural connections have been correlated with language deficits mostly in post-stroke aphasia 10111213 and recently in PPA 1415161718192021 . The degree of white-matter tract disruption has been correlated strongly and repeatedly with language deficits to an even greater extent than grey-matter lesions 22,23 . For example, the degree of lesion in the left arcuate fasciculus has been correlated with speech production impairment in post-stroke aphasia 11,24 . In written language, we have shown that the structural connections of the mid-fusiform gyrus, but not gray-matter volume or integrity, accounted for the spelling deficits 22 . In PPA, previous studies from several groups including ours, have shown that integrity of white-matter tracts correlate with language deficits in all PPA variants 14151617181920 .\nWith regard to language recovery and therapy, recent studies have identified structural integrity of the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi as important parameters for anomia recovery in the first 3 or 6 months post-stroke and of language severity at the chronic stage 25,26 . Other studies have shown an association between white-matter integrity and language therapy outcomes in post-stroke aphasia 26,27 . Finally, two recent studies showed that language therapy outcomes may also correlate with white-matter reconstruction in poststroke aphasia 26,28 . Therefore, white-matter integrity could be used as a biomarker of language therapy outcomes in post-stroke aphasia.\nWe are only aware of one study showing that tDCS induced white-matter changes in poststroke rehabilitation, which occurred in descending motor tracts and correlated with improvements in motor impairments after tDCS coupled with physical therapy 29 .\nTo our knowledge, no studies have investigated the integrity of white-matter tracts as predictors of language therapy outcomes in PPA, with or without tDCS. The present study addresses these gaps. Given that electrical current distribution models assume that current may flow through white-matter tracts, it is pertinent, from a theoretical perspective, to determine whether there is any association between the integrity of white matter tracts and the effects of tDCS on language therapy outcomes. Clinically, it is very important to determine whether baseline white-matter integrity predicts language therapy outcomes so that tDCS can be preferentially given to those who are most likely to benefit. The present study addressed the question of whether white-matter integrity predicts language therapy and tDCS effects in PPA. We first conducted an analysis of the behavioral results to determine whether tDCS treatment is beneficial. The goals of the behavioral analysis were threefold: (1) To determine whether patients benefited from tDCS in addition to language therapy and language therapy alone; (2) to identify whether therapeutic benefits maintained at different timepoints; and (3) to evaluate the effect of generalization, i.e., whether therapeutic benefits existed in both trained and untrained lists of items. The goals of the white-matter integrity analysis were twofold: (1) to determine which areas and tracts predict effects of tDCS in addition to language therapy and language therapy alone for trained items; (2) to determine which areas and tracts predict effects of tDCS in addition to language therapy and language therapy alone for untrained items (generalization effect). We hypothesized that the integrity of white-matter tracts between the stimulated area (left IFG) and the areas structurally connected to it in the ventral and dorsal tracts would predict tDCS in addition to language therapy and language therapy effects on the treatment outcome (letter accuracy).",

The anode was placed over the left frontal lobe, centered on F7 in the 10-20 electrode placement system 36 . The cathode was placed over the right cheek. We aimed to excite the left frontal lobe with anodal stimulation, shown to augment language rehabilitation in other studies 37 . Non-metallic, conductive rubber electrodes, fitted with saline-soaked sponges to limit skin-electrode reactions, were 5 cm x 5 cm; because of the size, the full left IFG was covered. Current was delivered with an intensity of 2 mA (estimated current density 0.08 mAcm 2 ) for a total of 20 minutes each tDCS session. Delivery of tDCS was simultaneous with the start of language therapy, which continued for an additional 20-25 minutes beyond the cessation of tDCS in each session. Sham consisted of 30 seconds of current ramping up to 2 mA and back down to 0 mA simultaneous with the start of language therapy. These procedures have successfully blinded participants to the stimulation condition 38 . The speech-language therapist administering tDCS and language therapy was also blind to the stimulation condition. To monitor any adverse effects, each participant was asked to rate his or her pain level once or twice during each session, using the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scales (www.WongBakerFACES.org). Some participants reported tingling and itching that usually lasted for about 30 seconds. The protocol required 15 consecutive weekday sessions for each participant. We made every effort to keep this schedule, although some participants had to leave a few days earlier due to other life commitments.",

      "text": "We combined the spell-study-spell procedure 39 in our previous PPA treatment studies 3,40 with an oral and written naming paradigm 41 . Given the possibility of different spelling deficits in each variant, as both we and others have found 42,43 , we developed individualized trained and untrained word sets while maintaining the same procedures and outcome measures (letter accuracy).\nThe participant was shown a picture on a computer, asked to orally name it, and then to write the name. If the patient could not name the picture (orally or in writing), (s)he was asked to provide three characteristics of the item, to evaluate and reinforce semantic knowledge as in semantic feature analysis treatment 41 . If (s)he still could not produce the word orally, (s)he was provided with the correct word and asked to repeat it three times. Likewise, if the patient could not write it or wrote it incorrectly, the therapist provided the correct spelling in a spell-study-spell procedure, i.e., the clinician writes the correct word, reviews each letters sound, then asks the patient to copy the word three times.\nTrained and untrained sets (10-30 words depending on individual severity) were matched in length and frequency. Four evaluations were administered for each therapy phase: before therapy, immediately after the end of therapy, two weeks post-and two months post-therapy. Letter accuracy was determined based on a scoring system 44 that considered letter deletions, additions, substitutions, and movements. Letter accuracy was used as a more precise outcome instead of whole-word accuracy in order to capture the effects of the different types of errors. Each letter was evaluated with 1 point, 0.5 points for correct identification and 0.5 points for correct position. Scores for trained and untrained words were transformed to percentage points for each participant. Inter-rater reliability was managed as follows: each item was scored, then a second person performed ratings and noted discrepancies. Inter-rater reliability was 95. Discrepancies were discussed to generate a consensus score. This was a double-blinded study, i.e., not only participants but also speech-language therapists providing the treatment, as well as technicians performing evaluations and scoring performance were blinded to the treatment condition.",

      "text": "1. Longitudinal analysis of tDCS and sham intervention(s) on written naming -After intervention, written naming improvement was evaluated with change in letter accuracy at three different time points: immediately after, two weeks post-and two months post-therapy, for both trained and untrained sets. In this study, we considered the relative change in behavior as the outcome to account for the variation in the initial performance across patients. The improvement of behavior was measured in the relative scale defined as:\nwhere Z ij is the language outcome (percentage of letter accuracy) at the jth time point of subject i, for j  1,2 (immediately after and two-month post-intervention); and Z i0 is the language score pre-intervention. One advantage of using this relative change measure (proportional maximal gain) is that it addresses the possible ceiling treatment effects, especially for those subjects with a higher pre-intervention score, i.e., less progressed cases. This method has been advocated and used in previous reports of language therapy outcomes as well 45 . To track the treatment impact on the trajectory of improvement in behavior, the following mixed effects model was utilized:\nwhere the treatment group (denoted by G with G  1 for the tDCS group, and G  0 for the sham group), the evaluation time indicator (denoted by T with T  1 for the two months post measurement and T  0 for the immediately after timepoint), as well as their interactions as fixed effects; the αs are the model coefficients, u i is the random effect of subject i which is normally distributed with mean zero and variance τ 2 , ε ij is the model error term normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2 . With the inclusion of the interaction terms, we can compare the expected behavior (letter accuracy) change for different combinations of treatment group and time of evaluation, i.e., α 0 represents the expected letter accuracy score change immediately after the intervention for the sham group and (α 0 α 1 ) for the tDCS group; the expected letter accuracy improvement after two months is demonstrated by (α 0 α 2 ) for the sham group and (α 0 α 1 α 2 α 3 ) for the tDCS group. In order to balance the two groups, inverse probability weighting was employed, where the weights were estimated from a logistic regression model with variant type, sex, age, number of treatment sessions and language severity as the predictors.",

We included variant type and language severity in the model to account for potential confounding effects. The forward stepwise selection includes the following steps: (1) from all the brain regionsfasciculi, we select the one with the largest increment in the leave-one-out cross-validated coefficient of determination (ΔR 2 ), where the increment is significantly greater than zero; (2) repeat first step until no remaining factor has a significant ΔR 2 .

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, we asked the question of whether white matter integrity, as measured by MD and FA values from DTI scans, may predict effects of tDCS and sham interventions, each coupled with language therapy (written namingspelling), in PPA. Overall, the behavioral results of this study confirmed the results of the larger behavioral trial 2 while statistically controlling for (i.e., independent from) variant type: (a) both tDCS and sham coupled with language therapy caused significant improvements in treatment outcomes; (b) effects of tDCS coupled with written naming of trained items sustained significantly longer than sham (language therapy alone); (c) only the tDCS intervention generalized to untrained items both immediately after and at two-months post-intervention. We interpret the predictions for the behavioral effects in terms of white matter integrity of the two language streams: dorsal (SMG_L and SLF_L) and ventral (MTG_L, ITG_L, UnF_L). We found that tDCS effects in trained words were predicted by higher white-matter integrity of specific areas of the ventral language stream (UnF_L) at baseline, whereas tDCS effects in untrained words were predicted by higher white-matter integrity of the dorsal language stream (SMG_L, SLF_L) at baseline, and, consequently, by lower white-matter integrity of the ventral stream (MTG_L and ITG_L).\nRecent studies on the role of structural connectivity in rehabilitation have looked at whitematter connections both as a mechanism for language rehabilitation as well as a predictor 26,46 (see also Forkel, 2014 47 for a review). In such short intervention periods (2-3 weeks) we did not expect to find changes in the white-matter, so we looked at white-matter integrity only as a predictor for effects of tDCS and language therapy alone (sham). Overall, although the tDCS effects on language outcomes were larger than sham (see Table 2), the amount of variance that was explained by white-matter integrity for tDCS effects was smaller than the variance explained by white matter integrity for language therapy alone (sham), where the amount of variance is estimated by the sum of CV ΔR 2 in Table 3. Therefore, white-matter integrity was more predictive for language therapy alone than for tDCS effects.\nWith regard to the influence of white-matter integrity of specific areastracts, we found that, for trained words, tDCS effects were significantly influenced by the integrity of the UnF_L at both the two-week and two-month follow-up. Therefore, the integrity of the ventral language pathway predicted the sustainability of tDCS effects in trained items (lexical retrieval). Note that the left UnF here, that was our automated atlas, MRI studio, indication 48 , most probably represents the extreme capsule fasciculus. With the present methods, we can only capture the bundle that connects the left IFG to left temporal areas; the extreme capsule has also been found to be a probable anatomical correlate of lexical retrieval 49,50 as we discuss later on. In contrast, for generalization in untrained items, we found that only tDCS effects were significantly influenced by the white matter integrity of dorsal but not ventral tracts and areas (SMG_L and SLF_L). However, the effects were short-lived, i.e., significant only up to two weeks post-intervention. These dorsal areas and tracts have been found to be responsible for rule-based learning of phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences, i.e., the sublexical route, as opposed to the ventral route, responsible for lexical retrieval 49,50 .\nInterestingly, tDCS effects for both trained and untrained words were positively correlated with lower white-matter integrity in dementia-related areas (such as CG_L), indicating that tDCS may be particularly helpful in more progressed cases as previous studies have also suggested 5 . On the other hand, language therapy effects (sham) were positively correlated, i.e., significantly impacted by white-matter integrity in right hemisphere large dorsal bundles (SLF_R) and left hemisphere parietal and temporal bundles and areas (UnF_L, SMG_L and FuG_L) indicating that language therapy effects are impacted by several areas of the left hemisphere as well as the right hemisphere. Although the areas predicting treatment effects in language therapy alone cannot automatically be considered as potential candidates for tDCS, since the mechanisms may be different, it is important to stress the involvement of the right hemisphere in rehabilitation potential in PPA. Notably, even in the tDCS condition, the right-hemisphere homologue of our stimulation site, i.e., the IFG_R, predicted a small, albeit significant, amount of change in untrained items (7 change, p0.005, see Table 4).",

    "Towards a unified account of functional and structural connectivity in tDCS effects": {
      "text": "This is the first study, to our knowledge, to show significant associations between whitematter integrity and language therapy outcomes with and without tDCS in PPA. The present findings align with our previous findings 8 in gray matter volumes as predictors of tDCS effects in PPA. In that study, despite using absolute values for calculating therapy effects (in the present study we used proportional maximal gain), we found that gray-matter volumes of temporal areas responsible for storing lexical-semantic information 49,50 predicted tDCS effects in trained items. Similarly, gray-matter volumes of parietal areas (particularly the left SMG) responsible for performing rule-based computations (e.g., the Phoneme-to-Grapheme conversion 50 ) and for temporarily storing and encoding the sequencing of information 51 predicted tDCS effects in untrained items. Temporal areas (MTG_L, ITG_L) correspond to the ventral language pathways of the present study, directly connected to the stimulation area, the left IFG 50,52 . Parietal areas (SMG_L) correspond to the dorsal language pathways of the present study, also directly connected to the stimulation area, the left IFG 50,52 .\nThe present findings also align with previous findings on functional connectivity as a mechanism for tDCS effects. White-matter integrity has not been shown to be a mechanism for tDCS effects because there are no detectable changes in white-matter after such short interventions (2-3 weeks). With regard to mechanism, we 30 and others 53,54 recently showed, using resting-state fMRI, that tDCS gains were correlated with decreases in long-distance functional connectivity between the stimulated area and ventral areas responsible for active retrieval 55,56 (in our case, the left MTG, MTG_pole and ITG) 30 of therapy-trained words. Functional connectivity also predicts tDCS effects and to a much greater extent than structural connectivity as found here (up to 42 in one of our recent studies). In light of those results, we hypothesize that the modulations of functional connectivity between left IFG and ventral temporal areas 53,54 (i.e., the neural coactivation of those areas) may, at least partly, be due to structural connectivity between these areas 57 . Our results indicate that white-matter integrity may mediate the mechanism of tDCS effects, i.e., change in functional connectivity. A future mediation analysis combining the effects of both modalities would shed light on this important question.",

    "Limitations of DTI methods in the present study": {
      "text": "In the present study we focused on the language network. Therefore, connectivity of other areas that may have been implicated in important yet peripheral functions in therapy such as attention or learning were beyond the scope of the present study. Although interesting, including many areas as predictors, in addition to the other clinical variables such as variant type that we wanted to control for, would have made the analysis unstable from a statistical perspective due to the large number of predictors.\nA word of caution is needed when we refer to tracts. In the present study we used a DTI method based on a region-of-interest analysis (ROI) rather than actual tractography. Although this method measures the uncinate fasciculus as the only detectable ventral tract that directly connects the left IFG and left temporal areas, this may be an approximation since it does not reflect the whole spectrum of structural connectivity between frontotemporal areas. Besides the uncinate fasciculus, that actually does not connect IFG_L to temporal areas, a recently documented but difficult-to-identify fasciculus, the extreme capsule fasciculus, connects the IFG (triangularis) with superior, middle and inferior temporal areas 49,50,52,58,59 . With our methods we cannot be sure that we measured the uncinate and not the extreme capsule fasciculus as responsible for the tDCS effects because we measure only the volume of the white-matter bundle curve that could be either the UnF_L or the extreme capsule. In fact, it is difficult to identify single tract fasciculi with the methods employed here. Specific seeding in the extreme capsule and individual brain analyses are needed to determine this issue in subsequent studies. Whether the uncinate or the extreme capsule, these tracts are part of the ventral language stream 49,50,60 indicating that electrical current distribution from the left IFG has, at least partly, travelled through the axons of the ventral-stream fasciculi 60 .\nFinally, we would like to note some limitations about the DTI indices, FA and MD. Changes in DTI indices such as MD and FA are frequently interpreted as cellular loss, axonal degeneration, and defective myelination, among other factors. However, the seminal studies responsible for those interpretations, later translated and perpetuated in neuroscience, were mostly preformed in single-cell models that do not represent the complexity of the brain tissue. Also, they occurred in the absence of imaging nuisances such as noise, artifacts, and macroscopic resolution. Therefore, although DTI indices are sensitive markers of neuropathology, their physiopathological basis is far to be clear and MRI-based interpretations, although very commonly found in the literature, are far from definitive.\nThat being said, based in other disease models and methods, and post-mortem evaluation, FA can be considered a sensitive, non-specific, marker of microstructural architecture; while MD may be more sensitive to reveal diffusion changes related to dedysmyelination, encephalomalacia, inflammation, or all sorts of edema 61 . Commonly, neuropathologies show inverse trends (i.e., decrease  increase) on FA  MD. The sensitivity of these metrics unclearly varies. Given this complex scenario, it is out of our scope to make assertions about the physiological basis of changes in FA and MD, as MRI does not offer the necessary resolution to do so. Therefore, we can only vaguely speculate that our findings are driven by the most common factors beyond DTI indices: changes in tissue architecture and intraextra cellular composition.",

      "text": "Our study confirmed that tDCS over the left IFG augments written naming outcomes in PPA and increases sustainability and generalization to untrained words. However, regular language therapy (without tDCS) depends more on white-matter integrity than tDCS. Whitematter integrity of specific tracts is needed for tDCS: (1) the extreme capsuleuncinate fasciculi connecting the left IFG with temporal areas are needed for lexical retrieval (as evidenced for trained items); (2) fronto-parietal fasciculi (e.g., superior longitudinal fasciculus III) are needed for rule-based computations that lead to generalization of treatment effects (as evidenced for untrained items). Together with previous findings 8,30 , the current study reveals the interplay between structural and functional connectivity in tDCS effects in PPA. Effects of tDCS may, thus, depend more on functional than structural connectivity since they explain more variance for functional connectivity. The fact, however, that there was an inverse correlation between tDCS effects and white-matter integrity of dementia-related areas such as the cingulate, shows that tDCS may help to circumvent white-matter damage in neurodegenerative disorders, probably by modulating functional connectivity. Understanding the contributions of white-matter integrity, cortical volume and functional connectivity is crucial in bringing the field of neuromodulation in rehabilitation of PPA from imprecision to precision. Our results have important implications for clinical decisions for choosing which patients would benefit from language therapy or electrical stimulation in neurodegenerative disorders but also which behavioral treatments may be more appropriate or beneficial for each patient.

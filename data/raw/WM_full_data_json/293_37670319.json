    "abstract": "Background Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare multisystem disease with global developmental delay and autistic features. Genetically, the disease is based on a heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22q13.3 with involvement of at least part of the SHANK3 gene or heterozygous pathogenic variants in SHANK3. Pathophysiologically, this syndrome has been regarded as a synaptopathy, but current data suggest an additional concept, since axonal functions of neurons are also impaired, thus, the specific pathophysiological processes in this disease are not yet fully understood. Since symptoms of the autism spectrum, regression, and stagnation in development occur, we investigated whether neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes may also play a role. To this end, we analysed biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and parameters from magnetic resonance imaging with high-resolution structural T1w volumetry and diffusion tensor imaging analysis in 19 Phelan-McDermid syndrome patients. Results CSF showed no inflammation but abnormalities in tau protein and amyloid-ß concentrations, however, with no typical biomarker pattern as in Alzheimers disease. It could be demonstrated that these CSF changes were correlated with integrity losses of the fibres in the corticospinal tract as well as in the splenium and dorsal part of the cingulum. High CSF levels of tau protein were associated with loss of integrity of fibres in the corticospinal tract; lower levels of amyloid-ß were associated with decreasing integrity of fibre tracts of the splenium and posterior cingulate gyrus. Volumetric investigations showed global atrophy of the white matter, but not the grey matter, and particularly not in temporal or mesiotemporal regions, as is typical in later stages of Alzheimers disease. Conclusions In summary, alterations of neurodegenerative CSF markers in PMS individuals could be demonstrated which were correlated with structural connectivity losses of the corticospinal tract, the splenium, and the dorsal part of the cingulum, which can also be associated with typical clinical symptoms in these patients. These findings might represent a state of dysfunctional processes with ongoing degenerative and regenerative processes or a kind of accelerated aging. This study should foster further clinical diagnostics like tau-and amyloid-PET imaging as well as novel scientific approaches especially in basic research for further mechanistic proof.",

    "Background": {
      "text": "The Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a disease (OMIM606,232) characterized by a global developmental delay with motor deficits (muscle hypotonia), expressive and receptive language development delay, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as mood disorders, regression, and autism spectrum disorders 1. The clinical variability is wide, a finding that has not yet been conclusively explained pathophysiologically. The genetic changes underlying the syndrome also vary greatly from point mutations, deletions, inversions, translocations affecting in most cases SHANK3 on chromosome 22q13.3 2, i.e., SH3 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing protein.\nCurrently, patients with a partial deletion in the chromosomal region 22q13 without SHANK3 involvement have been recognized who have a similar clinical phenotype so that the nomenclature of the syndrome has recently been adjusted in PMS-SHANK3 related or PMS-SHANK3 unrelated 3.\nSHANK3 encodes structural proteins of the postsynapse of excitatory neurons 4. The components of the postsynaptic density and in particular the SHANK proteins are presumably relevant for processes such as learning and long-term potentiation through the induction of plasticity via spine and synapse formation 5. SHANK3 is not only expressed within the brain in the hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum 6, but also outside the brain in muscles 7 and neurons of the peripheral nervous system 8.\nMeanwhile, there are also data that the PMS is not only a disease of the synapses, but also of the white matter with impairment of the directionality of certain fibre tracts 9,10. Thus, Phelan-McDermid syndrome as a multisystem disease has been well characterized in the genetic and clinical domains, but has pathophysiologically not yet been fully deciphered. For this reason, patients with the syndrome should receive extensive exclusion diagnostics of commonly reported comorbidities after receiving the genetically based diagnosis, especially since clinical organ involvement has been described as part of the disease 1.\nThe current study is based on multimodal data from diagnostic processes and addresses the following questions:\n1.) Can cerebrospinal fluid be used to demonstrate inflammatory or neurodegenerative processes in patients with PMS? 2.) Is there a morphological correlate in the brain for changes in the CSF biomarkers that can be associated by means of advanced volumetric or microstructural MRI data? 3.) Are there differences in the results related to the classification of patients into PMS-SHANK3 related and PMS-SHANK3 unrelated?",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "PMS is a genetic multisystem disease whose genotype and phenotype have been characterized in increasing detail 13,14, but whose pathophysiology is only partially understood. Clinical symptoms such as autism spectrum, regression or regressive phases as well as developmental arrest raise the question of whether cerebral inflammatory or degenerative processes play a role in its pathophysiology. To this end, CSF and MRI data from PMS patients were examined. In our PMS cohort, no inflammation in CSF could be demonstrated as neither the basic parameters cell count, lactate, oligoclonal bands nor the additional inflammatory biomarker CXCL13 was pathological. The results were different for markers of neurodegeneration given that the degeneration markers tau protein and amyloid-ß showed pathological values in more than 60 of the patients, regardless of whether there is genetic SHANK3 involvement or not, according Abbreviations: OCB  oligoclonal bands, Aß  amyloid-ß, CXCL13  C-X-C motif chemokine 13, pNF-H  neurofilament heavy chain to the current classification into PMS-SHANK3 related and PMS-SHANK3 unrelated. However, only descriptive statements can be made here, as the group of PMS-SHANK3 unrelated with one patient does not allow to make a statistical statement. Alterations were usually detected in just one of these biomarkers. As the typical pattern like in Alzheimers disease (i.e., increased tau protein, decreased amyloid-ß, increased p-tau, and decreased amyloid-ß 4240 ratio) 15 could, thus, not be detected, a typical AD-like neurodegeneration process is apparently not existent in our PMS cohort. Next, we analysed whether changes in tau and amyloidß biomarkers had associations with structural or microstructural measures of the brain, as assessed by MRI. To this end, we observed significant volume reductions in the patients of this study localized in the white matter of supratentorial structures, but not in the grey matter and especially not temporo-parietally or mesiotemporally as one would expect in AD-like pathology. These results led to the assumption that not gross volume changes, but microstructural processes are apparently impaired in PMS patients, as suggested by the very widespread white matter alterations in an unbiased whole brain DTI analysis. Thus, using whole-brain-based spatial statistics of DTI, a voxel-based correlation to tau and amyloid-ß showed a clear pattern for each of the biomarkers: Specifically, the direction of the fibres of the corticospinal tract was negatively correlated with tau values, meaning that pathologically high tau values were associated with a greater reduction in the integrity of the fibres of this motor tract. Possibly, plastic changes in the sense of degenerative and regenerative processes of the microtubules may represent a pathophysiological correlate of these alterations. There is a possible clinical connection between these results and motor functions in the affected patients who have a motor developmental delay with global muscular hypotonia, gait ataxia, and fine motor dysfunction.\nThe association analysis with amyloid-ß showed a pattern with impairment of the integrity of fibre connections of the splenium and the dorsal cingulum, i.e., the pathologically lower the amyloid-ß values, the lower was the directionality of the nerve fibres. The posterior part of the cingulum receives connections from the posterior parietal cortex, but other cortical afferents to this part of the cingulate gyrus include fibres from the visual and auditory association areas 16. The functions of these structures relate to memory, in particular working memory, visuo-spatial and autobiographical memory functions 17. Together with the fibres of the splenium corporis callosi, these fibre tracts are closely connected with the parietal and medial temporal lobes and, according to Broca 18, represent parts of the large limbic system. Clinically, patients with PMS show varying degrees of cognitive impairment, ranging from mild intellectual disability to severe cognitive impairment. Learning processes are possible with persistent training and repetition, but deficits in short-term memory often appear, which makes it difficult to learn new memory content. In addition, the patients show affective disorders such as withdrawn behavior as well as attention deficits and impaired adaptation behaviour to environmental stimuli 19 as a further clinical association with the limbic system.\nIn summary, changes in the neurodegeneration markers tau protein and amyloid-ß in the CSF of patients with PMS seem not to show the typical biomarker pattern of Alzheimers pathology. In line with this, there are neither morphological indications of atrophy nor clinically assessable indications of the development of a dementia Table 3 Atlas-based volumetric data. Level of significance was set to p  0.001 (after correction for multiple comparisons). Abbreviations: CSF  cerebrospinal fluid; WM  white matter; GM  grey matter; SD  standard deviation syndrome. Unexpected was the regional association for both biomarkers with taucorticospinal tract and amyloid-ßstructures of the limbic system. Based on our microstructural MRI results, one could argue that these results may not reflect degenerative processes sensu stricto, but rather dysfunctional processes which may also be an expression of accelerated aging, as described by Braak and coworkers in autopsies of children and adolescents 20. Alternatively, the changes could be an expression of neuronal plasticity with constant remodelling and adaptation processes to external stimuli which remains open.\nIt will be exciting to address these questions with further diagnostic tools like tauamyloid-PET imaging as well as basic research using iPS cell models and translational SHANK3 animal models to further characterize the (patho-)physiological assignment of our results.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "More than 60 of the Phelan McDermid patients investigated here have alterations in the CSF degeneration markers tau protein and amyloid-ß without exhibiting the typical pattern seen in patients with Alzheimer disease. The tau and amyloid-ß changes are associated with both functional changes in specific tract systems and clinical symptoms. It remains exciting for further investigations whether these results represent adaptation processes to external stimuli or premature aging processes.",

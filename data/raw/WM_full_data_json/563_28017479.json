    "abstract": "White matter degradation is a major part of the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). The fornix is the predominant outflow tract from the hippocampus, and alterations to its microstructure in patients with AD are still being explored. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an in vivo neuroimaging technique that can provide unique information about alterations in tissue microstructure, which can indicate underlying neurobiological process at the microstructural level. In this prospective study, DTI was used to assess and analyze the microstructural features of the fornix in subjects with AD (n  17), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n  12) and healthy controls (n  17). DTI was performed using Explore DTI software and the FSL package. Within the fornix, patients with AD showed decreased fractional anisotropy values and length of fiber tracts of the fornix relative to healthy controls, but higher mean diffusivity values. MCI subjects showed a trend towards elevated mean diffusivity values in the fornix. The data suggest that DTI provides supporting information on the microstructural alteration of the fornix in patients with AD, and that these diffusion characteristics of the fornix may be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of AD.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is generally characterized by gray matter pathology; however, convergent evidence suggests that white matter degradation also plays a substantial role in its pathogenesis. There are studies that have reported reduced FA andor increased MD in white matter tracts in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) andor established AD, in comparison with healthy controls. These changes have been documented within the corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, corticocortical association fibers, and the corticospinal tract (Catheline et al., 2010;Fellgiebel and Yakushev, 2011;Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012a;Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012b;Zhuang et al., 2013). As for the fornix, which is the predominant outflow tract of the hippocampus and carries the efferent projections from the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and subiculum (Aggleton et al., 2010), its changes in patients with AD and MCI are still being explored, and the results of the related studies are contradictory. Reduced FA values in the fornix of patients with AD are reported (Mielke et al., 2009;Ringman et al., 2007), and reduced FA values in the fornix have been suggested as a novel imaging marker for amnestic MCI (Bozoki et al., 2012); however, no difference in fornix FA values was found between amnestic MCI and normal subjects by Kehoe et al (2015). DTI tractography has shown decreased microstructural integrity of major white matter tracts in amnestic MCI subjects, although the results varied considerably within studies (Mielke et al., 2012;Pievani et al., 2010). So whether measures of microstructural integrity of the Fornix clearly identify AD-related changes is still unclear. Whether the diffusion characteristics of the fornix be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of patients with AD or be a novel imaging marker for AD need further confirmation.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a in vivo neuroimaging technique for mapping the properties of water diffusion. It has proven helpful for providing unique information on tissue properties and underlying neurobiological processes (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008), as it is highly sensitive to alterations in tissue architecture at the microstructural level. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are the most widely used DTI quantitative indices and can quantify alterations in diffusivity of water molecules and the structural integrity of tissue. The length is a DTI tractography index which refers the length of reconstructed streamlines of fornix and partially reflects the morphology and integrity of the fiber tract (Parker et al., 2003). It can be easily influenced by microstructural lesions of fornix, and microstructural alterations of fornix also easily lead into diffusion changes. Because DTI potentially enables mapping of white matter tract alterations, it has become an important tool in studies on AD (Ai et al., 2014;Gold et al., 2012;Nishioka et al., 2015;Rémy et al., 2015). Its clinical applications have been investigated.\nThe objectives of this study were to analyze the fiber tracts of the fornix using FA, MD, and fiber length in patients with AD, MCI and normal control subjects, and to clarify the clinical value of these factors in the diagnosis of AD.",

      "text": "Seventeen patients with AD, 12 subjects with MCI and 17 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to this prospective study (Table 1). AD patients were diagnosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (Dubois et al., 2007). MCI patients were diagnosed according to the general MCI criteria including the following: 1) the person is neither normal nor demented; 2) there is evidence of cognitive deterioration; and 3) activities of daily living are preserved and complex instrumental functions are either intact or minimally impaired (Winblad et al., 2004). The Minimal-Mental Simple Examination (MMSE) scores were measured for all of the subjects. All subjects were recruited from inpatients at the neurology department of Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing. Written informed consent was given by all subjects before the study, and ethical approval was attained from the local hospital Ethics Committee.",

      "text": "The FA, MD and length of reconstructed streamlines of fornix were calculated from DTI images using Explore DTI software (Leemans and Jones, 2009) and the free FSL package (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk fsl). Image preprocessing included three key steps (Fletcher et al. 2013). First, DWI volumes were eddy-current corrected by using affine registration to b0 volume to remove the distortion induced by head motion and magnetic field changing. Second, brain tissue was extracted using a semiautomatic protocol (BET in FSL, http:www.fmrib.ox.ac. ukfsl) with a proper fractional intensity threshold. Third, in order to identify precise anatomical location, DWI were aligned to their corresponding T1-weighted MPRAGE images using rigid transformation. This alignment was driven by the FA information from the DWI data sets and included the preservation of principal direction.\nFornix tractography was performed by placing ROIs on each dataset by using AND operators to allow tracts to pass through, and NOT operators when tracts were not allowed to pass through (Rijken et al. 2015). First, whole brain tractography was performed on each data set using a uniform 2 mm seed point resolution, a 1 mm step size, a maximum angle threshold of 45, and an FA tract termination threshold at 0.2. Fornix tract were then extracted by placing two AND ROIs on the location where fornix passed through. Two ROIs were placed at the body of the fornix on the coronal slicing plane being perpendicular to the fornix body orientation for each data set (Fig. 1). One of the authors with substantial experience in neuroanatomy drew the ROIs. The definition of these ROIs followed the recommendation of Rijken et al. (2015). FA, MD, and fornix length were then automatically measured for the defined fornix tracts, FA100Length was calculated finally by one of the authors (Table 1).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In our study, we found that there were no inter-groups difference in age, degree of education and gender, respectively. The discussion below about the DTI measurements among groups were based on this situation. So we can overlook the impact of age, degree of education and gender on the inter-groups difference.\nFA value of the fornix was lowered in patients with AD in comparison with healthy controls and MCI subjects. This finding is consistent with previous reports. Previous studies found that early familial AD patients showed decreased FA in the fornix (Ringman et al., 2007), AD patients had lower FA in the fornix than healthy controls (Mielke et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2012;Agosta et al., 2011). All of these studies also demonstrated that lowered FA in fornix correlated with memory decline and which also may be an indicator of AD progression (Mielke et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2012;Agosta et al., 2011). But in our study we did not found FA values in the fornix correlated with MMSE scores, the reason is unclear, maybe due to relatively smaller sample size. Lower FA in the fornix partially reflects lessor fornix integrity, so we can take the point that patients with AD show bad fornix integrity, and FA value in the fornix may be an indicator of AD progression.\nHowever, we found that there was no difference in FA values of the fornix between HC and MCI subjects, although the mean of the index was lower in the MCI subjects than in the healthy controls. Other studies have also reported the same finding that FA values in the fornix showed no difference between amnestic MCI and health controls (Agosta et al., 2011;Nowrangi et al., 2013;Oishi et al., 2012). But there was one study reported a significant difference in FA values of the fornix, not only between healthy controls and AD patients but also between healthy controls and MCI subjects (Bozoki et al. 2012). While Zhuang et al. (2013) reported that FA values of the fornix changed significantly in the late phase of MCI. Therefore, the findings about FA values in the fornix of MCI patients is still controversial, and the clinical utility of FA measurement in the fornix of MCI patients need Note: MMSE  minimal-mental simple examination, FA  fractional anisotropy, MD  mean diffusion, HC  healthy controls, MCI  mild cognitive impairment, AD  Alzheimers disease, p  0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nfurther demonstration. The reasons for this discrepancy in the reports may be due to different sample sizes, heterogeneity of the MCI subjects, and differences in data acquisition and processing. MD values in the fornix were lager in MCI subjects and AD patients, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. And one study reported the same result that MD values in the fornix of AD patients were not significantly different compared with HC or MCI subjects (Pievaniet al., 2010). However, there are studies demonstrate that MD values were elevated in the fornix of patients with AD (Agosta et al., 2011;Fletcher et al., 2013;Nowrangi et al., 2013), and that MD values were already different in the early phase of MCI patients (Zhuang et al., 2013). One study comparing AD patients and healthy elderly controls, found that alterations in MD in the fornix were more significant and sensitive indicators of differences than alterations in FA (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010). We considered the different findings of MD values in the fornix of patients with AD due to differences in data acquisition and processing.\nAnd it is well known that the fornix contains the prominent outflow fibers of the hippocampus. Many studies confirmed that higher hippocampal MD values in patients with AD (Douaud et al., 2013;Kantarci et al., 2010;Rose et al., 2008). On the basis of this anatomical connection, and of the fact that the hippocampus is the site of the earliest pathology in patients with AD, we speculated that higher MD values in the fornix may follow on from increased MD values in the hippocampus in patients with AD, in other words, the fornix microstructure might change following changes to hippocampal microstructure. Hence, MD values may also be an appropriate metric for the assessment of fornix changes in AD, in addition to FA values.\nThe present study demonstrated that the length was smaller in patients with AD compared with healthy controls and MCI subjects and that FA100Length of fornix was larger in AD group than in HC group. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that fornix length and FALength were chosen to be metrics quantifying morphology in patients with AD. Given that fornix length being acquired from the whole brain tractography can be easily influenced by microstructural lesions of fornix, and that microstructural alterations of fornix also easily lead into diffusion changes, fornix length was selected for quantifying the morphological alterations between groups. We found that the alterations in fornix length demonstrated that the integrity of the fornix was damaged in patients with AD, in accordance with other reports suggesting atrophy or alteration of the integrity of the fornix in patients with AD (Copenhaver et al., 2006;Lee et al., 2012;Fletcher et al., 2013). And the difference of the FALength ratio in patients with AD indicated different diffusion characteristics in the fornix, the FA Length may be a better predictor of the white matter integrity of the fornix in patients with AD. But such a change was not clearly observed in the MCI subjects, the length was not significantly different between healthy controls and MCI subjects in our study, although the mean was lower in MCI subjects. Currently, there are studies also find that fornix volume is significantly different in patients with AD compared with NC, rather than in MCI group (Bozoki et al., 2012;Oishi K. and Lyketsos C.G., 2014). And there have already been algorithms (Tang et al., 2014) that can provide 3D automated segmentations of selective WM tracts of interest such as the fornix, which is available for the subjects with a varying degree of structural abnormality. So the manifestation of both metrics of fornix in patients with AD need further investigation and as for the clinical available and utility of fornix length and FALength for quantifying morphology also need a large scale of studies to confirm.\nAlthough we found that there were no correlations between FA and MD values in the fornix and MMSE scores in the three groups, recent evidence indicates that the fornix microstructure was correlated with episodic memory (Aggleton and Brown 2006;Rudebeck et al., 2009). Mean fornix FA values were positively associated with episodic memory (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2011;Lee et al., 2012). These correlations have to be interpreted within the limitations of a crosssectional design. And small sample size is likely the reason for the lack of significant correlations between FA and MD in the fornix and MMSE scores.\nThe study has some limitations. First, cerebral spinal fluid partial volume effect is inevitable, which could impair fornix signal and influence fornix consistently delineate. Second, this study did not consider the observed lack of difference between HC and MCI, or MCI and AD whether or not related to the sample size. Third, this study is cross-sectional, so as for how the microstructural metrics changed in the fornix in patients with AD need longitudinal studies.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation grant numbers 81271541.",

    "abstract": "Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recent MRI technique demonstrating white matter tracts in the brain. Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease and this method has been used to demonstrate the loss of axonal fi bers and myelin and decrease of fi ber density in this condition. Purpose: To study a possible correlation between frontal lobe symptoms in patients with dementia and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matterfascicles in the frontal lobes. Material and Methods: The study included 23 patients with dementia and frontal lobe symptoms and 20 controls (10 Alzheimer patients without frontal lobe symptoms and 10 normal controls). Clinical tests and MRI with DTI were performed. FA in subcortical white matter of both the frontal lobes was analyzed and correlated with clinical frontal score tests. Results: We found a signifi cant correlation between frontal score results and reduction in FA in the frontal lobes. The FA in the study group was signifi cantly lower than the FA in the control group. Conclusion: The present study reveals that there is a probable correlation between the extent of frontal lobe symptoms and FA in fascicleswhite matter tissue in the frontal lobes.",

      "text": "Dementia is a growing health care problem, whichin addition to the personal tragedy for each patienthas a future signifi cant economic and medical impact.\nThe diagnosis of dementia can be diffi cult to establish. It is made by proxy information, clinical assessment, and test procedures. Usually the diagnoses are set according to the International Classifi cation of Diseases (ICD) 10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM) IV (1, 2). In principle, the diagnosis of dementia and further classifi cation of dementia, i.e. Alzheimer  s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), frontal lobe dementia (FLD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD), are not defi nitely set until an autopsy has been performed (3 -5).\nThere is an ongoing work aimed at improving and refi ning clinical tests for dementia (6). Other diagnostic methods such as imaging and genetics have also been used (7,8). The imaging procedures in question have been MRI with volumetry of the hippocampus, perfusion, and MR spectroscopy, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and nuclear medicine with PET and SPECT (9). MR volumetry of the hippocampus is most widely in use (10 -13). The use of MRI with DTI, with or without fi ber tracking, is relatively new (14). It has nevertheless become widely popular in brain research (15,16). It has been assumed and reported that DTI with quantitative fi ber tracking will enable assessment of age-related degeneration in the central nervous system (17). DTI has been found to be a useful tool in both early detection and monitoring of disease progression (18 -20). It has been established that patients with AD have a reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter, as measured with DTI (21 -23). Several studies have shown a correlation between aging and changes in the white matter as well as a correlation between DTI fi ndings and cognitive decline (24,25).\nIt is established that FA is generally reduced with increasing age. However, it is unknown whether diseases such as FLD show a specifi c reduction in FA. Two articles have presented results indicating this (26,27). Will a reduction in FA frontally be correlated with the degree of frontal lobe symptoms? One study has shown for the fi rst time that the integrity of specifi c white matter tracts is a mediator of age-related changes in cognitive performance (28). The aim of our investigation was to study whether there is a correlation between frontal lobe symptoms and reduced FA in white matterfascicles in the frontal lobes.",

      "text": "Twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the study group (13 females and 10 males; mean age 74 years, median age 80 years). The inclusion criteria were a clinically established dementia diagnosis with frontal lobe symptoms.\nAll the patients had a full assessment for dementia to establish the diagnosis. The ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria were used to diagnose dementia. In this study we used the Frontal Lobe Inventory to correlate the fi ndings of the DTI (see Appendix, available with the online version of the journal at http:www.informaworld. com10.310902841851003709870).\nThe frontal lobe symptoms used to include the study patients were loss of initiative, inhibition, inattentiveness, inability to concentrate, behavior disorders, diffi culty in learning new information, and inappropriate social behavior.\nAfter 1 year follow-up of the study patients we established a fi nal diagnosis of 14 patients with AD with frontal lobe symptoms and 7 patients with FLD, 1 patient with LBD, and 1 with VD.\nTwo control groups were analyzed: 10 patients with established AD, but no frontal lobe symptoms (6 males, 4 females, mean age 77.0 years), and 10 normal controls (4 males, 6 females, mean age 71.9 years).\nThe degree of frontal lobe symptoms was compiled from the Frontal Lobe Inventory and the clock test (see Appendix for the Frontal behavioral inventory -available with the online version of the journal).\nFurthermore the following psychometric tests were performed:\n(1) The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test (29), which is a brief 20-item questionnaire test with a score range of 0 -30 that is used to assess cognition. It is commonly used for screening dementia. The scale tests fi ve areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, and language. The MMSE was used to screen all patients and control for evidence of dementia.\n(2) The clock-drawing test assesses executive, visuos patial, and visuoconstructive functions ( 30). ( 3) The Frontal Behavioral Inventory is a 24-question scale, which is based on a caregiver interview assessing the patient  s behavioral problems (Appendixavailable with the online version of the journal).\nThe MRI examination was performed on a GE Signa Excite 1.5 T scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisc., USA) with an eight-channel head coil: 2D EPSE sequence, auto shim, TR ϭ 7900 ms, TE ϭ 97 ms, FA ϭ 90  ; 26 axial contiguous 4 mm slices, FOV ϭ 240 mm, 128 ϫ 128 acquisition matrix, fi ve b ϭ 0 acquisitions and 25 diffusion sensitizing directions with b ϭ 1000 smm 2 and two averages; scan time 8:10 min.\nThe DTI analyses were performed on an external computer, using nordicICE (Nordic Neurolab, Bergen, Norway) for pixel-wise computing of the diffusion tensor and its deprived FA index. For each subject, FA and apparent diffusion coeffi cient (ADC) values were computed according to established practice as mean and standard deviation (SD) within manually delineated regions of interests (ROIs). These ROIs were placed in white matter of the left and right frontal lobes (LFL and RFL), respectively and in the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC). To avoid being biased by the FA values themselves, we used the T2-weighted bϭ 0 images as template for manual delineation.\nThe ROIs were placed manually in the subcortical white matter of both left and right frontal lobes. The placement was done by an MD (PhD student) not blinded to the patients  diagnoses. The ROIs were also placed manually by an experienced radiologist (23 years experience), blinded both to patient data and any information concerning placement. The ROIs had to be drawn manually, which could be a source of inter-and intraobserver variance. Accordingly, we tried to avoid this by having two observers. We registered the inter-and intra-observer variance without changes in results. The variation between the observers was at a kappa value  1. We had one patient as outlier with an inter-observer variance less than 10. After a consensus the data from the fi rst observer were included.\nAll clinical tests were correlated to the DTI results, but the emphasis was put on the correlation between frontal score and FA of the frontal lobes. The frontal lobe inventory is generally considered to be a better clinical test (31). The clock-drawing test was correlated to the FA results.\nAll clinical tests were correlated to the DTI results, but the main emphasis was put on the correlation between frontal score and FA of the frontal lobes. We used frontal scores with the full 24-question version. The statistical analysis used was the R software package version 2.7.1 (32).\nThe study was approved by the regional ethics committee.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "The frontal score registered in the study group showed a signifi cant correlation to measurements of FA. The mean and SD of FA values for LFL, RFL, and GCC for the study group and the two control groups are presented in Table 1.\nFigs. 1 and 2 illustrate the correlation of LFL-FA and RFL-FA in the study group with Frontal Lobe Inventory (FLI) score. In the subgroup clinically diagnosed as patients with AD with additional frontal lobe symptoms, the results show a signifi cant correlation of low FA and frontal score (Figs. 3 and4).\nThe results of the clock-drawing test, which is a test for assesssment of executive function, also show a signifi cant correlation to FA values (Figs. 5 and6).\nThe FL FA values in the study group were significantly lower than in the normal control group (Figs. 7 and8). Also FL FA values in the study group were signifi cantly lower than those in AD controls without behavioral symptoms (Figs. 9 and 10).\nFig. 11 shows manually delineated ROIs in left and right frontal lobes. Fig. 12 shows FA mapping in one of the patients from the study group.\nThe results therefore indicate that specifi c clinical testing for frontal lobe symptoms is correlated with reduced FA values in the frontal lobes.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We have found a correlation between the severity of frontal lobe symptoms and FA in white matterfascicles in the frontal lobe. To our knowledge this has not been reported earlier.\nWe cannot report a distinct clinical utility of implementing such a method. This must be considered basic research. However, this method could become an important diagnostic tool if clinicians could obtain objective results revealing relevant changes in the white matterfascicles to the frontal lobes. To organize care and treatment it is imperative to distinguish types of dementia and to fi nd the optimal treatment. This method may have a future impact on the diffi cult task of differentiating dementia with frontal lobe symptoms from simple AD.\nAll patients with dementia in our hospital routinely undergo MRI, including DTI. The entire present study group represents 1 year of consecutive patients with the above defi ned inclusion criteria. To study subgroups, collaboration and multicenter studies are needed.\nEarlier investigations have shown that age-related decline could be demonstrated as low values of FA in cerebral white matter (28). Studies have also found reduced FA values correlated to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but this has not been directly correlated to the degree of frontal symptoms (27). We have not specifi cally included FTD with frontal symptoms, but all dementia variants with frontal symptoms. The majority of the included patients, 14 in number, had AD clinically, 7 had FLD, 1 had LBD, and 1 had VD.\nOur fi ndings may implicate that there is a direct correlation between loss of fi bers to the frontal lobes and frontal lobe symptoms. The majority of the patients had an established AD, but with frontal lobe symptoms. This raises the question of the possibility that the degradation of fi bers to and in the frontal lobes may be the cause of AD with frontal symptoms, FTD with frontal symptoms, or is it possible that the loss only enhances frontal lobe symptoms in AD?\nThe obvious limitation of this study is the limited material. It is, however, diffi cult to achieve a large material. To fi nd the patients with the proper inclusion criteria, 1 year of consecutive patients (approximately 600) were examined. Ideally, we should have had larger subgroups of AD with frontal lobe symptoms, FLD and FTD, then we could have analyzed statistical differences and both made more accurate conclusions and analyzed possible clinical usefulness.\nIn spite of this we have been able to demonstrate that FA is low in all dementia patients with frontal lobe symptoms as well as a subgroup with AD with frontal lobe symptoms.\nWe have measured FA and ADC. ADC measurements did not give any signifi cant results. We did not compare the measurements to cerebral atrophy. This might be a weakness, as gross atrophy might make placement of ROIs diffi cult.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that FA of the frontal lobe is highly correlated to frontal lobe symptoms and behavior. It remains to be seen how much of the frontal lobe symptoms can be explained by loss of fi ber integrity in this region, and if this fi nding can be reproduced in larger samples.",

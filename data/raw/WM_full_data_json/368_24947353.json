      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a twofold increased risk of dementia and can affect many cognitive abilities, but its underlying cause is still unclear. In this study, we used a combination of a battery of neuropsychological tests and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore how T2DM affects white matter (WM) integrity and cognition in 38 T2DM patients and 34 age-, sex-, and education-matched normal control subjects. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used to assess a wide range of cognitive functions. Tract-based spatial statistics combined with region of interest-wise (ROI-wise) analysis of mean values of DTI metrics in ROIs was used to compare group differences of DTI metrics on WM skeletons to identify severely disrupted WM tracts in T2DM. We found that T2DM patients showed 1) various cognitive impairments, including executive function, spatial processing, attention, and working memory deficits; 2) widespread WM disruptions, especially in the whole corpus callosum, the left anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC.L), and external capsule (EC); and 3) a positive correlation between executive function and WM integrity in the ALIC.L and the left EC. In conclusion, T2DM patients show various cognitive impairments and widespread WM integrity disruptions, which we attribute to demyelination. Moreover, executive dysfunction closely correlates with WM abnormalities.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the elderly is a major public health problem. In China, .20.4 of the elderly population has diabetes, among which T2DM accounts for ;90 (1). As a risk factor for cognitive decline, T2DM is associated with a twofold increased risk of dementia (2) and can affect a wide range of cognitive abilities (3,4). However, its underlying cause is still unclear.\nA number of studies were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of T2DM-induced dementia and attributed the cognition decline to cerebral microstructure impairments, which included gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) destruction (5,6). Despite the importance of GM atrophy in T2DM, WM microstructure abnormalities played a distinct and irreplaceable role in cognition impairments induced by T2DM (7,8). WM has a vital role for transferring information between GM regions, and its efficiency depends on WM microstructural integrity (9). However, the relationship between WM microstructural changes and T2DM is debated and contradictory. Many studies suggested a close correlation between T2DM and WM lesion (WML) severity or progression (5,10), but others did not (11,12). This uncertainty could be partly due to the insufficient sensitivity of conventional MRI modalities in detecting subtle brain WM changes or assessing the severity of WM hyperintensities (WMH) (7).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a new type of MRI, has been developed as a powerful noninvasive technique to investigate WM microstructures and integrity (13,14). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) describe fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in WM based on quantitative measure of the degree of diffusion anisotropy (15,16). As reported previously based on the DTI technique, decreased FA or increased MD in varieties of cognitive dysfunction related to Alzheimer disease (AD) (17,18), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (19), schizophrenia (20,21), and type 1 diabetes (22), etc. Thus, DTI techniques are important for exploring more sensitive imaging-based biomarkers in prevention and early treatment of cognitive dysfunction induced by T2DM. However, there were only a few DTI-based investigations in WM disruption in T2DM (7,16), and Hsu et al. (7) reported a remarkable FA decrease in the bilateral frontal WM and increased MD in T2DM patients by assessing the DTI with global and voxel-based analyses (VBA).\nHowever, VBA methods that many previous researches performed may encounter atrophy-induced WM tract misregistration, which causes an unexpected decrease in accuracy. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), a corresponding fully automated whole-brain analysis technique based on DTI images, improves the sensitivity, objectivity, and interpretability of analysis of multisubject diffusion imaging and applies voxel-wise statistics to diffusion measures in various studies (23,24).\nIn our present study, we assessed cognitive functions with a battery of neuropsychological tests, measured WM structural integrity quantitatively using the TBSS method based on DTI data in T2DM subjects, and evaluated the correlation between WM disruptions and cognitive dysfunctions.",

All of the T2DM patients were diagnosed by a physician and had a history of using oral antidiabetic medications or insulin. Of the 38 T2DM subjects, 13 subjects are under treatment with insulin and 27 subjects control blood glucose using oral hypoglycemic agents. The duration of diabetes was defined as the number of years since diagnosis. All subjects had a medical history and physical examination, during which height, weight, and BMI were recorded. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ), and cholesterol levels were measured with standard laboratory testing. Exclusion criteria for the groups were a previous history of neurological or psychiatric disease including stroke, dementia, or transient ischemic attack and unsuitability for MRI (e.g., due to a pacemaker, prosthetic heart valve, or claustrophobia).

Third, the nonbrain space in the raw images was cut off, leading to a reduced image size, reducing the memory cost, and speeding up the processing in subsequent steps. Fourth, each diffusion-weighted image was coregistered to the b0 image using an affine transformation to correct the eddy current-induced distortions and simple headmotion artifacts. The diffusion gradient directions were adjusted accordingly. Fifth, a voxel-wise calculation of the tensor matrix and the diffusion tensor metrics were yielded for each subject, including FA, MD, axial diffusivity (l 1 ), and radial diffusivity (l 23 ).",

The TBSS analyses of FA, MD, l 1 , and l 23 images were carried out using the FMRIB software library (FSL 4.1.4; http: www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). In brief, first the following fivestep process on the FA images was performed: 1) the FA image of each subject was aligned to a preidentified target FA image (FMRIB58_FA) by nonlinear registration, 2) all of the aligned FA images were transformed onto the MNI152 template by affine registration, 3) a mean FA image and its skeleton (mean FA skeleton) were created from the images of all the subjects, 4) individual subject FA images were projected onto the skeleton, and 5) voxel-wise statistics across subjects were calculated for each point on the common skeleton.\nThe voxel-wise statistics in TBSS were carried out using a permutation-based inference tool for nonparametric statistical thresholding (the randomize tool, part of FSL). In this study, voxel-wise group comparisons were performed using nonparametric, two-sample Student t tests between the T2DM and control groups. The mean FA skeleton was used as a mask (thresholded at a mean FA value of 0.2), and the number of permutations was set to 5,000. The significance threshold for between-group differences was set at P , 0.05 (family-wise error FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) using the threshold-free cluster enhancement option in the randomize permutation-testing tool in FSL.\nData for MD, l 1 , and l 23 were generated by applying the above FA transformations to additional diffusivity maps and projecting them onto the skeleton with projection vectors that were identical to the vectors inferred from the original FA data. The statistical analyses of these diffusion tensor metrics were performed similarly to the FA analysis.",

      "text": "Recently, a few WM atlases (e.g., the ICBM-DTI-81 WM labels atlas see http:cmrm.med.jhmi.edu and the JHU WM tractography atlas) have been proposed (28). These WM atlases in the standard space allow for parcellation of the entire WM into multiple region of interests (ROIs), each representing a labeled region in the atlas. In our current study, to investigate the diffusion changes in specific tracts, the ICBM-DTI-81 WM labels atlas was used to parcel the entire WM into 48 ROIs, and only the 40 ROIs in cerebral regions (we focused on the 40 WM tracts within the cerebrum and did not consider the other 8 ROIs within the cerebellum and brain stem) were used for the analysis (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Then, the regional diffusion metrics (i.e., FA, MD, l 1 , and l 23 ) were calculated by averaging the values within each region of the WM atlas.\nLinear regression analyses were performed to compare the resultant ROI-based data between the T2DM and control groups. Age, sex, and education years were treated as covariates in the regression analysis. A false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to correct for multiple comparisons.\nDemographic, clinical, neuropsychological, and behavioral data were analyzed in SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In the current study, we found that T2DM patients showed 1) various cognitive impairments, including executive function, spatial processing, attention, and working memory; 2) widespread WM disruptions, especially in the whole CC, ALIC.L, and EC.L; and 3) a positive correlation between executive function and WM integrity in ALIC.L and EC.L. Considering that WM microstructural impairments underlie common mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and disrupt the large-scale distributed brain cognitive networks, our findings imply that extensive WM destruction plays a distinct role in cognition decline associated with T2DM. Our investigation provides novel insight into the neuropathological effects of WM integrity reduction on cognition in T2DM. FA and MD are the primary DTI-derived metrics believed to reflect overall WM health, maturation, and organization (15,16). In addition to these primary DTI measures, l 1 , which reflects axon integrity, and l 23 , which reflects myelin sheath integrity, can be useful in understanding the underlying physiology (8,29). Based on the voxel-wise TBSS statistical analysis, we found decreased FA in almost the whole cerebral WM skeleton in T2DM (P , 0.05, FWE corrected) and increased MD in the whole CC, bilateral corona radiata, IC (except the right posterior limb of it), EC, posterior thalamic radiation, cingulum (cingulate gyrus), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and tapetum. These widespread WM microstructural impairments disrupt the large-scale distributed brain cognitive networks and underlie the various cognitive dysfunctions in T2DM. To date, there are several studies suggesting various WM impairments in diabetic patients. Partly consistent with our results, Kodl et al. (22) suggested that diabetic subjects had significantly lower FA than control subjects in the posterior corona radiata and the optic radiation. Hsu et al. ( 7) reported a remarkable FA decrease in the bilateral frontal WM in T2DM patients by assessing the DTI with VBA. Hoogenboom et al. (8) found that T2DM patients showed lower FA in the cingulum bundle and the uncinate fasciculus. Despite these findings, disrupted WM in T2DM patients in our study exhibited significantly decreased FA, and increased MD and l 23 , with no striking between-group differences in l 1 . Accordingly, the alteration of FA and MD might be mainly attributed to the increase in l 23 but not l 1 . Given that l 23 is a specific marker of myelin alterations whereas l 1 is more related to axonal injury (30), our data showed that demyelination may be an important contributing factor to WM abnormalities in T2DM.\nTo identify the more severely impaired WM tracts in T2DM patients, we used a stricter correction criterion (P , 0.002, FWE corrected) in the voxel-wise TBSS statistical analysis and found significant differences between the T2DM and control group in the FA values of eight WM tracts. Furthermore, we measured the mean value of DTI metrics of ROIs by ROI-wise statistical analysis. Significantly reduced mean FA values were detected in 10 WM ROIs in T2DM patients (after FDR correction). Combining the results of the two analyses (both the ROI-wise statistical analysis and the voxel-wise TBSS statistical analysis), T2DM patients showed WM microstructural impairments in WM tracts of whole CC, the ALIC.L, and the EC.L when compared with the control group. The CC plays an important role in interhemispheric functional integration. In AD (31,32) and MCI (32,33), the loss of WM connectivity and regionally specific atrophy of the CC are observed. It follows that CC abnormalities may be related to cognitive deficits. The ALIC.L is a portion of the IC that connects the medial and anterior thalamic nuclei with the prefrontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus. Several studies have found that the ALIC also plays an important role in cognition function. The lower FA value of the ALIC correlates significantly with impaired declarativeepisodic memory performance (34) and cognitive levels (35). The EC is a route for cholinergic fibers from the basal forebrain to the cerebral temporal cortex, transmitting auditory and polymodal sensory information. As reported, the EC is crucial for cognition, including memory and executive functioning (36). Some studies (37) suggested that T2DM exacerbates the damage of WM integrity in the IC and EC bilaterally, which can result in executive dysfunction and memory deficits and may be To further understand the brain mechanism of cognitive impairment, we performed a correlation analysis between WM impairment and cognition decline. We found FA in the EC.L and ALIC.L positively correlated with Stroop C-B time in the T2DM group, which represents executive function. Executive functions are high-level cognitive functions for the management of a series of cognitive processes (38), including working memory, problem solving, planning, and execution (39). Several studies reported a close relationship between executive dysfunction and WM impairment. Sun et al. (40) found declines in executive function in mild WML subjects. Zheng et al. (41) revealed that executive function directly correlated with FA in frontal WM tracts, especially the ALIC. Smith et al. (42) found that WMH volume in the ALIC was strongly inversely associated with (43). Therefore, we propose that executive function might be partially supported by the WM integrity of the ALIC and EC. On the other hand, considering that there were no significant associations between WM integrity and cognition in the control group, we believe that executive function may be more sensitive to WM integrity variations in T2DM. WM integrity could be more beneficial to neuropsychological performance in T2DM subjects than in control subjects. As a major risk factor for dementia, diabetes is reported to be closely associated with the pathological processes of various dementias such as AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). AD can be regarded as a cortical disconnection syndrome that affects not only the cortical neurons but also the axons and dendrites in the cerebral WM (18). MCI, the prodromal phase of AD, impairs memory function and disrupts widespread WM tracts (19). Although extensive WM alterations were also exhibited in T2DM patients in the current study, some studies suggested that T2DM might not be a driving factor of AD but might add to the damaging effects of AD on cognition. Correspondingly, executive dysfunctions are closely related to WM abnormalities in T2DM. At the same time, many investigations have found that FTD affects executive function through regional disruption of the frontal and temporal lobes (44), where the more severely disrupted WM tracts were found in T2DM. Therefore, we predict that T2DM might be associated with FTD. However, the relationships between T2DM and AD or FTD are not clear 1.\nFigure 5-The significant correlations between ROI-wise diffusion metrics and behaviors in T2DM and control groups, respectively.

      "text": "Zhang and Associates to date. An interaction analysis of T2DM and MCI, as well as follow-up investigations, is worthy of further study in our future research.\nIt is also interesting that we found that there were more abnormal WM tracts in the left hemisphere than in the right. Thompson et al. (45) suggest that the shifting GM deficits in AD were asymmetric (left . right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status. The HAROLD (hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults) model states that age-related hemispheric asymmetry reductions may function to compensate for the lower prefrontal activity lateralization during cognitive performances in older adults than in younger adults (46). Accordingly, the mechanisms of how T2DM affects hemispheric symmetry of WM integrity are worthy of further investigation. Additionally, our study is limited by its cross-sectional design, which should be interpreted cautiously, and longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the conversion of T2DM to dementia and to evaluate clinical values of WM metrics to predict longitudinal changes. Further, we only focused on the WM changes in T2DM patients in this study. The relationship between these functional and structural changes, however, is still unclear. In future studies, the putative connection between functional connectivity and WM degeneration could be examined.\nIn conclusion, there are widespread WM integrity disruptions, which are likely caused by demyelination, and various cognitive impairments in T2DM patients, among which executive dysfunction closely correlates with WM abnormalities. The current investigation will contribute to a better understanding of the neuropathological process in T2DM and may lead to better imagingbased biomarkers for prevention and early treatment of cognitive dysfunction caused by T2DM.",

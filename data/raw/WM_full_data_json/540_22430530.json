    "abstract": "Different diffusivity measurements in diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) could be helpful for detecting the distinct mechanisms of white matter degeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, few studies have explored the changes of white matter in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD by whole-brain voxel-wise analyses of all diffusivity indices. The association between grey matter atrophy and white matter damage measured by distinct diffusivities is still uncertain. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and DTI with four diffusivity indices, comprising fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, were performed in 30 normal controls, 26 mild AD patients, and 40 aMCI patients with isolated memory impairment. T1 voxel-based morphometry and DTI tract-based spatial statistics were applied to compare the grey and white matter changes in the 3 groups. In contrast to the lack of significant white matter change presenting in aMCI patients, extended white matter degeneration over entire cerebral networks was exhibited in mild AD patients. Both axonal degradation and demyelination contributed to the white matter degeneration in AD; nevertheless, demyelination essentially involved the frontal portion of cerebral networks. Axonal degradation and demyelination over the temporal region were associated with the contiguous grey matter atrophy. However, only the severity of demyelination over the frontal region was correlated with the degree of atrophy over adjacent frontal grey matter. Our results suggest that different mechanisms of white matter damage demonstrate discrete regional distribution in AD. Demyelination may independently correlate with contiguous grey matter over the frontal region.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Increasing evidence supports amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) as a very early or prodromal stage of Alzheimers disease (AD). By investigating the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of normal aging, aMCI, and AD, we can obtain important information on pathogenesis and the evolution of AD.\nGrey matter (GM) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies indicate that left medial temporal atrophy is the most consistent biomarker for predicting the progression from aMCI to AD 1. However, functional imaging revealed that the posterior cingulum is the most prominent hypometabolic region in the early stages of AD 2,3. Furthermore, a recent default mode network functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that disconnection over the posterior cingulate area precedes atrophy in this area 4. Therefore, damage of white matter (WM) fiber integrity may develop independently in the pathogenesis of AD.\nThe underlying mechanisms related to WM degeneration in AD remain uncertain. Changes in WM can be a primary event or secondary to the atrophy of GM. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive technique that can measure direction-dependent diffusivity of water molecules to reflect the underlying neural structure on a microscopic scale 5. DTI has been used to detect the integrity of WM fibers, which is undetectable by conventional MRI 6,7. Most previous DTI studies adapted its derived indices, fractional anisotrophy (FA) or mean diffusivity (MD), to indicate the severity of WM damage in AD or aMCI, where FA is the relative ratio of axial to radial diffusivities and is usually used to indicate the integrity of WM fibers, while MD means the average diffusivity of all three dimensions 6,7. A recent DTI meta-analysis study demonstrated that regions with altered MD and FA happened in most of the brain regions in AD and aMCI subjects 5. In addition to the between-studies variation of recruited subjects, this high heterogeneity might arise from the different diffusivity measures and methods of analysis used. Furthermore, FA only indirectly probes the microstructural properties of WM 8. Decrease in FA has been found in various pathologies 9101112 and regions where there are crossing fibers 8.\nMD represents the average diffusivity of all three dimensions. FA is the relative ratio of axial to radial diffusivities and is indicative of the integrity of WM fibers 9,10. However, FA only indirectly probes the microstructural properties of WM 11. Decrease in FA has been found in various pathologies 12131415, and crossing fibers also produces variations in FA.\nRecently, the separation of the diffusivities into axial (DA) and radial (DR) components has been validated as a specific measure in the longitudinal and transverse diffusion directions 16. Change in DA indicates axonal damage in fibers; in contrast, alteration in DR supports demyelination with disruption of myelin integrity 17. By measuring the changes of DA and DR, Di Paola and colleagues reported both axonal degeneration and myelin breakdown might be responsible for the callosal degeneration in AD patients 18. Few neuroimaging studies have explored the WM changes in AD patients using whole-brain voxel-wise analyses of four different diffusion indices 19202122, and only two of them enrolled aMCI patients 21,22. Knowledge of the characteristics of WM degeneration in the aMCI and AD remains scant.\nWe recruited aMCI patients with isolated memory impairment to avoid subjects who may already have been early AD. Whole-brain VBM and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were applied to examine changes in GM and WM. We hypothesized that both GM atrophy with secondary axonal degeneration and retrogenesis with demyelination would be found in the WM pathology of AD. We aimed to explore the characteristic distribution of and the correlations between GM and WM degeneration in aMCI and AD patients.",

      "text": "All DTI datasets were preprocessed using FSL v4.1.6 (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library; http:www. fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). To reduce the motion effect and to minimize the eddy current distortion caused by fast-switching gradient, the diffusion weighted images of each individual were linearly registered to the non-diffusion weighted image by using the command-line tool eddy correct, which is available in FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT; part of FSL). Subsequently, the DTI datasets were skull stripped using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET; part of FSL) 33 to remove the background noise and non-tissue components.\nAfter preprocessing, FA, MD, DA (axial diffusion component), and DR (transverse diffusion component) of each voxel were calculated based on Bassers DTI model 10 using an in-house software. Voxel-wise analysis of the DTI-related indices was carried out using TBSS 34, which was implemented in FSL. Briefly, to increase the registration accuracy across the subjects, one FA map was determined to be the most representative FA map which caused the minimal warping when all the other FA maps were registered to it. To find the most representative FA maps of the entire study group, we registered every subject to each other using the command-line tool tbss 2 reg with the -n flag, which is available in FSL. This function summarizes the mean displacement of each FA image and then chooses the most representative FA map as being the one with the minimum mean displacement distance to all other subjects. This most representative FA map was then affinetransformed to the Oxford FMRIB58 FA standard template using FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT; part of FSL). All participants FA maps were transformed into MNI standard space by combining the non-linear image transfer to the most representative FA map using FMRIBs Non-linear Image Registration Tool (FNIRT, part of FSL) with the affine transform from the most representative FA map to MNI standard space. The final normalized FA images were resampled into 1 mm cubic resolution. All normalized FA maps were averaged to create a crosssubject mean FA image, which was skeletonized to construct a mean WM skeleton. The FA threshold of the mean WM skeleton was set at 0.2 to exclude voxels consisting of GM or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the majority of subjects. Each subjects transformed FA data were projected onto this mean WM skeleton by filling the skeleton with FA values from the nearest relevant tract center. To simultaneously investigate MD, DA, and DR, the transformation matrix and skeleton projection information of FA obtained in the above steps were applied to the other diffusivity maps.\nTo identify differences among the three groups, voxel-wise permutation-based nonparametric ANCOVA design was used 35. Age, gender, and years of formal education were included as covariates of no interest in the model. Statistical inference on each contrast was performed using 5000 permutations at random (Randomise, part of FSL).\nGroup-related differences were investigated using the Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE approach), a clustering algorithm without an arbitrary threshold for the initial cluster formation 24. To avoid the multiple comparison problems, the cluster maps were assessed for significance using FWE-corrected statistics for an appropriate correction (FWE-corrected p  0.05).\nThe most possible fiber tracts and anatomic localization of each significant cluster were determined using the JHU White Matter Tractrography atlas of the FSL atlas tool (http:www.fmrib.ox. ac.ukfslfslviewatlas.html).",

Whole-brain native space T1-weighted images were bias-field corrected and tissue-classified into GM, WM, and CSF partitions based on the generative model unified segmentation 38. This segmentation procedure was further refined by applying an iterative hidden Markov field (HMRF) model 39 to minimize the influence of the noise level during segmentation.\nTo achieve higher accuracy of registration across subjects, the segmented native space GM, WM, and CSF tissue segments were imported into a rigidly aligned space and iteratively registered to studyspecific customized tissue templates, which were generated from all images in the whole study group through non-linear warping using the DARTEL toolbox in SPM5 (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) 29. The spatially registered tissue segments were then multiplied by the Jacobian determinants derived from the nonlinear deformation. The final voxel size after the entire procedure was 1 mm cubic. All normalized, segmented, and modulated MNI standard space images were smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel in advance of the tissue volume calculation and voxelwise group comparisons. The overall tissue volumes were estimated in 1 mm 3 by counting the voxels representing GM, WM, and CSF in standard space. The total intracranial volume (TIV) was determined from the sum of the GM, WM, and CSF volumes.\nTo ensure that statistical thresholds in T1 VBM and DTI TBSS analysis were comparable, the smoothed modulated GM segments were analyzed using FSL 4.1.6 with a framework of permutation-based nonparametric testing (Randomise, part of FSL tool; http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslrandomiseindex.html) 40. ANCOVA was used with the covariates of TIV, age, gender, and years of formal education to investigate the differences in regional GM volume among the 3 groups. The TFCE clustering approach used in the DTI-TBSS analysis was used again to determine significant clusters, and FWE corrected p  0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons across space. Only clusters sized larger than 50 voxels were reported. Anatomical structures of the coordinates representing significant clusters were identified on the basis of the Talairach and Tournoux atlas 41.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The advantage of this study is that we concurrently examined the changes of GM and four different DTI indices in normal aging, aMCI, and mild AD patients. This approach allowed us to investigate the characteristic anatomical distribution of different types WM damage in aMCI and AD patients.\nBecause aMCI subjects with multiple cognitive domains impairment may already have pathological changes close to those in mild AD 44, we enrolled aMCI patients with isolated memory impairment to investigate how WM degeneration develops in the aMCI stage. By checking the changes in GM and WM at the same statistical threshold, we found that left medial temporal atrophy is distinct in aMCI; in contrast, WM degeneration is not evident at this stage.\nThe diffusivities measured in DTI can be decomposed into three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues: λ1, λ2, and λ3. The MD stands for the average diffusivity from three overall dimensions ((λ1  λ2  λ3)3) 5. The relative ratio of axial to radial diffusivities is known as FA 9,10. Most previous DTI studies focused on using the change in FA or MD to identify the severity of the WM damage in AD or aMCI. However, decrease of FA has been found in variable pathologies, including disruption of myelin integrity, changes in axonal morphologic structure, alteration of inter-axonal spacing of fiber bundles, CSF, and local edema 12131415. Furthermore, crossing fibers also produces variation in FA 14.\nRecently, separating the diffusivity measurement into axial and radial components has been validated to indicate changes in nerve fibers more specifically 16,454647. The axial component, DA, is the diffusion coefficient along the direction of maximal apparent diffusion (λ1), and the radial component, DR, is the average of the second and third eigenvalues ((λ2  λ3)2). Alteration of DA is an indicator of axonal damage and wallerian degeneration 17,48. In contrast, change in radial diffusivity (DR) signifies the disruption of myelin integrity in the demyelinating process 16,45.\nTwo other studies 21,22 evaluate the WM changes in aMCI and AD patients by whole-brain voxel-wise analysis with four diffusivity indices. Bosch et al. reported that aMCI patients showed significant changes in several diffusivity indices 22. Douaud et al. found that only crossing fibers in the centrum semiovale showed significant anisotrophy changes in aMCI 21. However, we did not find any significant diffusivity differences between the NC and aMCI groups. In contrast to the isolated memory impairment in our aMCI patients, most of the aMCI patients in Douauds study are multi-domain aMCI. Conversely, better MMSE scores are noted in our aMCI than in Boschs aMCI patients (26.8 vs. 25.5). Therefore, our aMCI patients are in an earlier stage of aMCI than theirs. The WM damage may not have occurred or may be trivial in this early MCI stage.\nFA is generally assumed to be a satisfactory marker of the integrity of WM tracts 14. This is based on the assumption that FA reductions are driven by increased DR and that constant DA occurs in demyelination and axonal loss. We noted that MD is more sensitive than FA in detecting WM changes in AD patients. Similar results are reported by other studies 20. In this study, most of the areas that showed decrease in FA also showed increase of both DR and DA. When the increase in DA is proportional to the increase in DR, FA would remain relatively unchanged 20,22. Therefore, investigating all possible measurements of DTI is extremely important in the research of neurodegenerative diseases.\nIn structural MRI studies, reduction of WM volumes are noted in AD patients 495051. Numerous pathology studies also support the idea that WM degeneration are involved in AD. Identified WM pathology in AD includes the decrease of myelin density 52, loss of oligodendrocytes 53, and activation of microglial cells 54. Comparable results were reported in DTI studies of AD patients. Measuring the different diffusivity indices of DTI demonstrates both axonal degeneration and myelin disruption in AD or MCI patients 20,22,55,56.\nExamination of the nature of WM damage by different DTI measures in this study reveals that both axonal degradation and myelin disruption contribute to WM degeneration in AD. However, axonal damage (increase of DA) without obvious demyelination (no DR increase) is observed over the splenium of the CC. This suggests that Wallerian degeneration with axonal disintegration secondary to the GM atrophy over the temporal region is the principle WM pathology in the posterior portion of the CC. Demyelination is mainly located in the genu, anterior mid-body of the CC, and frontal portions of cortico-cortical fibers. Previous DTI studies of AD 575859 and Di Paolas study targeting the WM changes of CC in AD 60 reported similar findings. Our results support the theory that retrogenesis with demyelination in AD starts from the later-myelinating fibers located over the anterior part of the CC and cerebral networks 61,62.\nIn the correlation analysis, we confirmed that most of the measurements of WM damage in the temporal and frontal areas correlated with GM atrophy of the adjacent regions in aMCI and AD patients. Axonal damage in the temporal region was strongly correlated with atrophy over the temporal region. In contrast, the degree of myelin disruption, but not axonal damage, in the frontal region was correlated with the adjacent frontal atrophy. If WM change in the frontal region is followed by GM atrophy, then the degree of frontal atrophy should be strongly correlated with the degree of WM change in the adjacent frontal region. Our findings suggest that the retrogenesis process in the frontal region may contribute to GM atrophy over this region. A recent default-mode network fMRI study also demonstrated disconnection over the posterior cingulate area preceding the atrophy in this area 4. Our study is the first to suggest that the demyelinating process in the frontal region may contribute to the atrophy of the contiguous frontal GM. However, further prospective study is required to confirm whether the demyelinating process in the frontal region in AD patients contributes to the GM atrophy over this region.\nWe did not find differences in GM volumes and DTI values among ApoE genotypes in all of 3 diagnostic groups. Our previous study reported ApoE 4 carriers had smaller hippocampal volumes 63 and several studies also demonstrated the effect of ApoE 4 on GM and WM at medial temporal region in both normal aging 646566 and AD subjects 666768. Small sample size and unequal distribution of ApoE 4 genotype in 3 diagnostic groups may diminish the effect of 4 in this study. Recently, studies found persons with ApoE 33 and VLVL TOMM40 polymorphism had decreased GM volume in the posterior cingulate and precuneus areas 69. AD related risk factors, such as hyperhomocysteinemia, also may impair the function of ApoE 3 70. We did not check the serum homocysteine concentration and TOMM40 polymorphism of our subjects. Subgrouping ApoE 33 subjects based on their TOMM40 polymorphism or homocysteine level may provide more information regarding the effect of ApoE 3 on GM and WM.\nOur study has some limitations. First, we only enrolled aMCI patients with isolated memory impairment. Using a less-affected sample may reduce the probability of finding WM changes in the early stage of AD. The other limitation is that this is a crosssectional study. Prospective investigation of GM and WM changes in a single individual would provide more direct information regarding the chronological changes in GM and WM in the evolution of AD.\nAnother issue concerns the intrinsic limitations of the techniques. The different registration techniques used in this study may introduce potential bias to our findings. Although the essence of registration algorithms in these two approaches is not the same, the registration approaches we applied in this study have been widely used to investigate GM and WM. Diffeomorphic based image registration is used in DARTEL T1 VBM, which is different from B-spline based registration in DTI TBSS. To reduce the potential bias due to the registration algorithm, the recent advanced diffeomorphic based DTI registration algorithms (i.e., full tensor information with non-parametric diffeomorphic deformable registration scheme) 71 and the diffeomorphic tensor-based registration approach 72 could be used.\nIn conclusion, both axonal degradation and demyelination over the temporal region were associated with contiguous GM atrophy. However, only the severity of demyelination over the frontal region was correlated with the degree of atrophy over the adjacent frontal GM. Further research prospectively investigating the sequential relationship between GM atrophy and different types of WM damage is required.",

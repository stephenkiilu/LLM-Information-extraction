We determined the added value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of strategic white matter tracts in explaining variance in cognition in memory clinic patients with vascular brain injury. Methods: We included 159 patients. Conventional MRI markers (white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunes, nonlacunar infarcts, brain atrophy, and microbleeds), and fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) of the whole brain white matter and of 18 white matter tracts were related to cognition using linear regression and Bayesian network analysis. Results: On top of all conventional MRI markers combined, MD of the whole brain white matter explained an additional 3.4 (p  0.014), 7.8 (p  0.001), and 1.2 (p  0.119) variance in executive functioning, speed, and memory, respectively. The Bayesian analyses of regional DTI measures identified strategic tracts for executive functioning (right superior longitudinal fasciculus), speed (left corticospinal tract), and memory (left uncinate fasciculus). MD within these tracts explained an additional 3.4 (p  0.012), 3.8 (p  0.007), and 2.1 (p  0.041) variance in executive functioning, speed, and memory, respectively, on top of all con-",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Brain MRI is often part of the diagnostic workup in memory clinic patients 1. Yet, it is often difficult to relate the cognitive deficits of patients to MRI-visible markers of brain injury, in particular atrophy and vascular lesions 2. This might be due to the fact that these visible lesions represent end-stage brain injury and do not capture early structural changes in the brain 2. White matter microstructure, which can be determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is an emerging and more sensitive marker for brain injury, both in patients with a primary neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and -possibly even more so -in patients with vascular brain injury.\nPrevious studies have shown that the whole brain white matter microstructure is associated with cognitive functioning, independent of conventional MRI markers for brain injury (atrophy, white matter hyperintensities WMHs, lacunes, and infarcts) in healthy communitydwelling individuals, and in patients with cognitive impairment due to either vascular injury or AD 345678. It is likely that the functional impact of disturbances in the white matter microstructure depends on their location, as is the case for visible vascular lesions 9,10, which would imply that the microstructural characteristics of strategic white matter tracts explain more variance in cognitive functioning than does the global white matter microstructure. Thus, assessing the strategic white matter tract microstructure might improve the extent to which MRI markers can help to explain the cognitive profiles of memory clinic patients with vascular brain injury. However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested.\nIn this study, we therefore determined the added value of DTI-based assessment of strategic white matter tracts in explaining variance in cognitive functioning in memory clinic patients with vascular injury. We determined if (1) cognitive functioning is related to the microstructural characteristics of domain-specific strategic white matter tracts, and (2) the microstructural characteristics of these strategic white matter tracts have added value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning on top of conventional MRI markers for brain injury and the global white matter microstructure.",

This cohort consists of consecutive patients who underwent a standardized evaluation at the memory clinic of either the Department of Geriatrics or the Department of Neurology of the UMCU and had vascular brain injury on MRI (i.e., possible VCI) 11. No minimal thresholds for cognitive impairment or specific patterns of vascular brain injury were defined, in order to capture the whole spectrum of patients presenting to a memory clinic with cognitive complaints and visible vascular injury on MRI.\nVascular injury on MRI was operationalized as: either (1) substantial vascular disease on MRI (defined as either WMHs of Fazekas grade 2 12, a lacunar infarct, andor 1 cerebral microbleeds), or (2) mild WMHs (Fazekas grade 1) combined with 2 or more vascular risk factors (see online suppl. Methods for details; for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.comdoi10.1159000485376), or (3) a prior diagnosis of ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. Also, patients were not selected based on evidence for the absence or presence of possible coexisting neurodegenerative etiologies, in line with the AHAASA criteria for VCI 1. This nonrestrictive approach allowed us to study the full spectrum of cognitive disorders in relation to vascular brain injury as seen in a memory clinic setting. Patients with a primary nonvascular and nonneurodegenerative etiology (e.g., brain tumor, hydrocephalus, and excessive alcohol consumption) were not included in the cohort. We excluded 19 patients with insufficient DTIMRI assessment, 1 patient with insufficient neuropsychological data, and 13 patients in whom the reconstruction of 1 white matter tract(s) failed (which was caused by complete interruption of a tract by a lacune in 2 patients), resulting in the final inclusion of 159 patients.",

The interobserver reliability of WMH segmentation was good to excellent (Dice similarity coefficient of 0.75 SD 0.14 and intraclass correlation coefficient absolute agreement of 0.98, based on segmentation of 22 randomly selected scans by 2 experienced raters).\nTotal brain volume and intracranial volume were quantified using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12b unified segmentation approach and used to compute the brain parenchymal fraction (brain volume intracranial volume) as a measure of brain atrophy 23. Diffusion MRI data were corrected for subject motion and eddy current distortions with ExploreDTI (www.exploredti.com) 24,25. The following data processing steps were subsequently performed: (1) diffusion MR images were registered to the corresponding T1 image to correct for echo-planar imaging deformations 26; (2) FLAIR images and corresponding lesion maps were registered to the corresponding T1 image; (3) whole brain fiber tracking was performed based on constrained spherical deconvolution, with the parameter setting and regions of interest as defined previously 27,28; (4) the results of the whole brain fiber tracking were used to extract the fractional anisotropy (FA)mean diffusivity (MD) of the whole brain white matter, normal-appearing white matter, and total WMH volume (expressed as the proportion of whole brain white matter affected by WMH); (5) 18 white matter tracts were reconstructed for each patient using previously described methods 29: the forceps minor and major, anterior thalamic radiation, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum of the cingulate gyrus and hippocampus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus for each hemisphere (see online suppl.

      "text": "The impact of disturbances in white matter microstructure on cognitive functioning depends on their location (i.e., cognitive functioning is related to the microstructural characteristics of domain-specific strategic white matter tracts). First, Bayesian network analyses were used to analyze the conditional dependencies between FAMD in the 18 white matter tracts, age, sex, and education as potential determinants, and executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory as outcome variables (bnlearn R package 30; settings described in Duering et al. 31).\nIn brief, Bayesian network analyses identify the variables with a deterministic influence on the (cognitive) outcome variables. The main advantage of Bayesian network analysis is that it deals well with multicollinearity. It separates variables with a direct deterministic influence on the outcome variables from other variables that, although showing a correlation with the outcome variable, have only an indirect influence when taking the direct determinants into account. The latter variables are therefore considered conditionally independent from the outcome variables. Bayesian network analysis produces networks in which direct determinants are connected directly to the outcome variables, while conditionally independent variables are connected only indirectly, via other variables.\nThe strength of the connections between direct determinants and cognitive variables was assessed by 100 bootstrap replications. We additionally performed a supplementary linear regression analysis to verify the results of the Bayesian network analyses in which the FAMD of each tract was related to each cognitive domain, followed by a Bonferroni correction for 36 comparisons.",

      "text": "The microstructural characteristics of strategic white matter tracts have added value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning on top of conventional MRI markers and global white matter microstructural characteristics. First, multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were performed with the z-score for each cognitive domain as the dependent variable. Age, sex, level of education, and conventional MRI markers (WMH volume, brain parenchymal fraction, and presence of lacunes, nonlacunar infarcts, and microbleeds) were first entered as independent variables, to verify the relation between global white matter microstructural characteristics and cognition, as known from the literature 3,5678. FAMD of the whole brain white matter and normal-appearing white matter were then added as independent variables to assess their added value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning. Next, DTI measures of the white matter tracts that were identified as strategic tracts in the Bayesian analysis (defined as a connection with a cognitive domain with a resampling frequency 50 in the bootstrapping replications) were added to the regression model, to assess their added value. Additionally, a stepwise backward linear regression analysis was performed to see which of the variables in the final model would be removed, indicating that their contribution to cognitive performance is fully captured by the variables that do remain in the model. This was done because it is likely that some MRI markers (such as global WMHs) become redundant when more sensitive markers (such as microstructural characteristics of the white matter) are added to the model. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed in which the backward linear regression analysis was repeated in the following subgroups of patients: (1) only patients with vascular dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (i.e., after the exclusion of patients with a diagnosis of dementia due to AD or other neurodegenerative etiologies); (2) only patients with vascular dementia or MCI (i.e., after additional exclusion of patients with no cognitive impairment); and (3) only patients with dementia due to AD.",

    "Added Value of the Strategic White Matter Tract Microstructure over Conventional MRI Markers": {
      "text": "As a first step, the variance in cognition explained by demographics, conventional MRI markers, and whole brain DTI measures was assessed. Age, sex, and education explained 6.5 of the variance in executive functioning, 8.7 of the variance in psychomotor speed, and 21.0 of the variance in verbal memory (Table 3, model 1). All conventional MRI markers combined (WMH volume, brain parenchymal fraction, lacunes, nonlacunar infarcts, and microbleeds) explained an additional 11.4 (p  0.002) of the variance in executive functioning, 8.0 (p  0.021) of the variance in psychomotor speed, and 5.6 (p  0.056) of the variance in verbal memory (model 3). On top of that, MD of the whole brain white matter explained an additional 3.4 (p  0.009) of the variance in executive functioning and 7.8 (p  0.001) of the variance in psychomotor speed (model 4b and 4d), whereas FAMD of the whole brain white matter did not improve the model for verbal memory.\nIn the next step, we determined whether the microstructural characteristics of the identified strategic white matter tracts were of added value. Adding the microstructural characteristics of the strategic white matter tracts to the model including age, sex, education, all (For legend see next page.) combined conventional MRI markers, and global DTI markers (FAMD of the whole brain white matter) (Table 3, model 5) further increased the explained variance in cognitive functioning. MD in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus explained an additional 2.2 (p  0.044) of the variance in executive functioning, MD in the left corticospinal tract explained an additional 3.8 of the variance in psychomotor speed (p  0.006), and MD in the left uncinate fasciculus explained an additional 2.1 (p  0.041) of the variance in verbal memory (Table 3, model 6).\nFinally, we performed stepwise backward linear regression analyses to establish for each cognitive domain which variables remained relevant and which became redundant when all variables were considered together (i.e., age, sex, education, all conventional MRI markers, MD and FA of the whole brain white matter, and MD of the strategic white matter tracts) (Table 4). For executive functioning, MD of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, presence of lacunes, and brain parenchymal fraction remained in the model.

Bayesian network analyses were used to analyze the conditional dependencies between FAMD in 18 white matter tracts, age, sex, and education as potential determinants, and executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory as outcome variables. Variables that are directly connected to one of the cognitive domains are identified as direct determinants. Variables that are connected indirectly to the cognitive domains (via other variables) are conditionally independent. As such, this method separates determinants with a direct deterministic influence on the outcome variable from other determinants that, although showing a univariate correlation with the outcome variable, have only an indirect influence when taking the direct determinants into account.

MD of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus remained in the model for executive functioning, MD of the left uncinate fasciculus remained in the model for verbal memory, and MD of the left corticospinal tract remained in the model for visuomotor speed (online suppl.

A sensitivity analysis after additional exclusion of patients with no cognitive impairment -thereby creating a cohort of patients (n  67) with vascular brain injury, objective cognitive impairment, and no primary diagnosis of dementia due to neurodegenerative disease -also generated the same results (online suppl. Table 4). In the sensitivity analysis including only patients with a diagnosis of AD dementia, MD of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus remained in the model for executive functioning (but with a lower explained variance; see online suppl. Table 5), whereas both global and regional DTI measures did not remain in the models for visuomotor speed and memory.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study shows that in memory clinic patients with vascular injury (1) the impact of disturbances in white matter microstructure on cognitive functioning depends on their location, and (2) the microstructural characteristics of strategic (cognitive domain-specific) white matter tracts have added value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning on top of all conventional MRI markers of brain injury and the global white matter microstructural characteristics combined.\nThe current study is the first to perform a fully integrated analysis considering both conventional MRI markers (i.e., visible vascular lesions and brain atrophy) and the microstructural characteristics of both the whole brain white matter and strategic white matter tracts in a single statistical model. Previous studies focused on DTI without taking visible lesions into account, or studied DTI measures and visible lesions at either the level of the whole brain white matter or the level of specific white matter tracts without taking global DTI measures into account 3-8, 32, 33. By considering all measures together, we are able to demonstrate the true additional value of the strategic tract microstructure on top of all the other measures. Furthermore, advanced and robust Bayesian network analyses allowed for the identification of the main determinants of each cognitive domain in a hypothesis-free fashion, taking into account intercorrelations and multiple comparisons. The reproduction of the involvement of the thus identified tracts in each cognitive domain in the linear regression analyses, a method that is statistically independent of the Bayesian analyses, provides converging evidence for a strategic role of these tracts in these specific cognitive domains. Moreover, by applying a spherical deconvolution-based tractography approach, we have addressed the main limitation of the conventionally applied DTI-based tractography, which is not being able to reliably reconstruct pathways in complex white matter configurations, for example, with crossing fibers 27,34,35.\nIn the current study, memory clinic patients with vascular injury were included using nonrestrictive criteria. Because vascular injury in memory clinic patients often co-occurs with AD pathologies 1,36, patients with cognitive impairment caused by a mixture of cerebral vascular disease and AD were also included in our study. This is in line with proposed criteria for VCI, which also include patients with co-occurring AD. In our cohort, 36 of the patients were diagnosed with dementia due to AD. In order to rule out that our findings are solely driven by AD-related neurodegenerative pathology, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia due to AD or other neurodegenerative etiologies, for which the results were essentially the same as for the main analysis (online suppl. Table 3). When both patients with dementia due to AD or other neurodegenerative etiologies and patients with no cognitive impairment were excluded from the analyses, the results of the stepwise backward regression analyses again remained the same: MD of the identified strategic tracts remained in the final model, whereas most conventional MRI markers became redundant (online suppl. Table 4). These findings suggest that in memory clinic patients with vascular brain injury, the microstructural characteristics of strategic white matter tracts are functionally relevant MRI markers that explain variance in cognitive functioning, also after excluding patients with co-occurring AD and patients without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, in the sensitivity analysis in which the analyses were restricted to only patients with a diagnosis of dementia due to AD, the association between MD in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and executive functioning remained, albeit with a lower explained variance, and the associations between DTI measures and visuomotor speed and memory were not reproduced (online suppl. Table 5). The associations observed between white matter tract microstructure and cognitive functioning might therefore reflect vascular injury. However, it should be noted that these associations may not only be driven by vascular or neurodegenerative pathology, but might also reflect normal or healthy structure-function relations 37. Hence, even when studied in the context of patients presenting with cognitive complaints and vascular brain injury, these DTI measures should not be considered as specific markers of vascular damage.\nPrevious studies have shown that adding DTI of the whole brain white matter to conventional MRI parameters is of additional value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning in patients with lacunar stroke and CADASIL syndrome and in healthy individuals with agerelated small vessel disease 567838. The reported variance explained by global DTI measures varied greatly depending on the studied population and analytic approach; in a study of 35 lacunar stroke patients, whole brain FA explained up to 40 of the variance in executive functioning (univariate analysis, not corrected for other variables) 5, whereas whole brain FA MD explained only 1 of the variance in cognitive functioning on top of conventional MRI parameters in a cohort study of 499 cognitively preserved community-dwelling individuals 6. Our findings indicate that global DTI measures have a significant added value in memory clinic patients with vascular injury (who often have mixed pathologies, i.e., a combination of age-related small vessel disease and neurodegenerative disease), a clinically highly relevant population that had not been studied before in this context.\nIn the Bayesian network analysis (Fig. 2), we identified several cognitive domain-specific strategic white matter tracts. The observed crucial role of the left corticospinal tract in deficits in psychomotor speed is in line with findings from a previous study of patients with CADASIL syndrome in which the lacunar volume in this tract was among the most important determinants of processing speed (probably reflecting the motor component of this cognitive domain) 39. A crucial role of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus in executive functioning, and of the left uncinate fasciculus in verbal memory, has also been previously suggested 32,33,40. The microstructural characteristics of several additional tracts had a significant correlation with cognitive functioning (online suppl. Table 2), but they were not identified as direct determinants by the Bayesian network analysis. Possibly, the current sample size provided insufficient statistical power to demonstrate these connections, even though this study is the largest to apply a DTI-based assessment of individual tracts in memory clinic patients with vascular injury to date. Consequently, our results should not be interpreted as a complete map of relevant white matter tracts for executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and memory. Instead, the findings of this study provide proof for the concept that in memory clinic patients with vascular brain injury, the microstructural characteristics of strategic white matter tracts are functionally relevant MRI markers in explaining variance in cognitive functioning beyond what is explained by conventional MRI markers and the global white matter microstructure. Of note, 2 patients had to be excluded because 1 tract(s) appeared to be completely interrupted by a lacune (the left anterior thalamic radiation in both patients, the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in one patient, and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus in one patient), which might have resulted in a slight underestimation of the impact of the microstructural characteristics of these tracts on cognitive functioning. The vast majority of tracts that were affected by lacunes or nonlacunar infarcts could still be reconstructed 20.\nIt is worth noting that though combining DTI measures with conventional MRI markers significantly improved the explained variance in cognitive functioning, a large part of the variance (70) remained unexplained. It is likely that integrating conventional MRI markers and DTI markers with additional markers, such as measures for structural brain connectivity 41, brain amyloid imaging 42, microinfarcts 43, and additional demographic data (such as lifestyle factors 1,44) may further increase the explained variance in cognitive functioning. Also, using quantitative measures for hippocampal 45, gray matter, and white matter atrophy (instead of using a single quantitative measure for global atrophy as was done in the current study) might help to further increase the explained variance in cognitive functioning. Assessing regional gray matter atrophy might be particularly interesting in relation to the DTI-based assessment of strategic white matter tracts, since subcortical vascular lesions are known to cause focal cortical thinning via secondary degeneration 46. An effort to acquire and integrate all these data into a large cohort in order to push the explained variance in cognitive functioning to a maximum would be interesting, but also very challenging. Also, it should be noted that a certain amount of variance in cognitive functioning will probably always remain unexplained by demographics and MRI markers, because the spectrum of normal (innate and acquired) variability in brain structure and function cannot be fully captured by such markers, and because of within-person variability in cognitive test performance (i.e., performance on cognitive tests are known to vary to some extent from one moment to the next) 47.\nBecause we wanted to determine the added value of DTI of strategic white matter tracts on top of conventional MRI markers (WMH volume, infarcts, lacunes, microbleeds, and brain atrophy) and global DTI markers, a relatively high number of variables were included in this study. The rationale behind this approach is that these conventional MRI markers are known to be associated with cognitive functioning in memory clinic patients, frequently used, and more readily available than DTI-based tractography. We therefore think that a new MRI marker that requires considerable data processing, such as DTI-based tractography, should not only be univariately associated with cognitive functioning, but ideally also prove to be of added value when compared with these more readily available MRI markers. To reduce the number of variables in the linear regression analyses, a Bayesian approach was first used to determine which of the 18 white matter tracts were associated with cognitive functioning, as this method deals well with multicollinearity and multiple comparisons. Even so, a relatively high number of variables were included in the final regression models, which increases the risk of overfitting. We therefore additionally used a backward regression model in which only a few variables remained (indicating that the other variables were redundant), and these few variables always included MD of the strategic white matter tracts (Table 4). These complementary Bayesian and linear regression-based analyses provide converging evidence for an association between MD of the identified strategic white matter tracts and cognitive functioning. Still, the added value of a DTI-based assessment of these tracts on top of conventional MRI and global DTI markers needs to be reproduced in another memory clinic cohort before an attempt to translate these findings to clinical practice can be made.\nIn summary, our findings suggest that the microstructural characteristics of strategic white matter tracts are functionally relevant MRI markers in memory clinic patients with vascular brain injury. The strategic white matter tract microstructure is of additional value in explaining variance in cognitive functioning when combined with both conventional MRI markers and the global white matter microstructure. Whether these associations are driven by (either vascular or neurodegenerative) brain injury or reflect healthy structure-function relations remains to be determined. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether a DTI-based assessment of strategic white matter tracts has any value in predicting the rate of cognitive decline and response to (pharmacological) treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in HIV-1-infected (HIVþ) patients, despite adequate suppression of viral replication by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Cerebral white matter structure alterations are often associated with cognitive impairment and have commonly been reported in the natural course of HIV infection. However, the existence of these alterations in adequately treated HIVþ patients remains unknown, as well as its possible association with cognitive impairment. Design: We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate whether white matter structure alterations exist in HIVþ patients with sustained suppressed viral replication on cART, and if such alterations are related to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Methods: We compared 100 aviraemic HIVþ men on cART with 70 HIV-uninfected, otherwise comparable men. Clinical and neuropsychological assessments were performed. From DTI data, white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion were calculated. Subsequently, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was performed, with and without masking out white matter lesions. Results: HIVþ patients showed diffuse white matter structure alterations as compared with HIV-uninfected controls, observed as widespread decreased fractional anisotropy and an increased mean diffusion. These white matter structure alterations were associated with the number of years spent with a CD4 þ cell count below 500 cellsml, but not with HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Conclusion: Cerebral white matter structure alterations are found in middle-aged HIVþ men with sustained suppression of viraemia on cART, and may result from periods with immune deficiency when viral toxicity and host-inflammatory responses were at their peak. These white matter structure alterations were not associated with the observed subtle HIV-associated cognitive deficits.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Although treatment of HIV-1-infected (HIVþ) patients with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) prevents severe HIV-related complications 1, cognitive impairment is often seen even when the infection appears adequately suppressed 2. The reason for this observation is unclear, but might be explained by cerebral white matter structure alterations. Cerebral white matter structure is particularly susceptible to direct cytopathic effects of viral replication and persistent immune activation and inflammation 3. Although cART potently suppresses viral replication and restores immune function, increased proinflammatory cytokine expression may persist 3,4. This is supported by elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of immune-activation in patients on prolonged effective cART 5. Moreover, toxicity of some cART-regimen may affect white matter structure 6. HIVþ patients are at increased risk of developing ageing-associated pathologies such as cardiovascular disease 6789, which may be accentuated by certain prevalent lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking, alcohol and recreational drug use), possibly impacting the white matter structure indirectly. As HIVþ patients age, all these factors may interact affecting tissue structure and eventually leading to cognitive deterioration 10.\nWhite matter structure alterations can be captured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which measures molecular diffusion of water, allowing white matter structure to be studied noninvasively 11. DTI provides information on the degree and localization of white matter damage and type of tissue disruption 12,13.\nStudies reporting DTI results in HIV-infection have thus far been inconclusive, with some studies showing white matter structure alterations in HIVþ patients , where others did not 373839. Furthermore, white matter structure alterations have been found to be variably related to the duration of HIV-infection, CD4 þ cell counts and cognitive impairment 212223242526272829303132333435363739,40. Within todays context of HIV-treatment, these studies show a high variability in detectable viral load. Also, not all HIV-patients were adequately treated on cART. Finally, included HIV-uninfected controls were not always matched in terms of lifestyle and comorbid disease. Many of these studies have also used a region of interest approach to examine white matter structure, which in the context of a diffuse pathological process is prone to miss abnormalities 24,31,32. As it remains unclear to what extent white matter structure alterations exist in chronic adequately treated HIV infection, and whether these alterations are related to cognitive impairment, a comprehensive whole brain approach is warranted 26,28.\nDue to the evolving nature of the HIVAIDS epidemic, it is likely that previous findings from studies of younger groups with high levels of viral load do not generalize to the majority of the HIV-infected population in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. It is essential that experimental groups are as representative of the HIV population as possible, hence our aim was to study a large group of middle-aged HIVþ men with sustained suppressed viral load on cART and include an HIVuninfected men control group that shared socio-demographic background and had similar life style and risk factors. Within this adequately treated and well defined cohort, we aimed to identify the degree of white matter structure alterations and associations with cognitive deficits.",

Specific exclusion criteria were current or past significant neurological disorders (i.e. traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness 30 min, stroke, seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis and dementia), central nervous system infections and tumours. Current significant psychiatric disorders, injecting drug use, daily use of noninjection illicit drugs (with the exception of cannabis), excessive alcohol consumption (48 units of alcoholweek), insufficient command of the Dutch language, intellectual disability and MRI contraindications were also reasons for exclusion.",

Preprocessing of DTI data was performed with software developed in-house (Matlab; Math Works, Natick, Massachusetts, USA, using the HPCN-UvA Neuroscience Gateway and using resources of the Dutch e-Science Grid 43. Head motion and deformations induced by eddy currents were corrected for by an affine registration of the diffusion weighted images (DWI) to the nondiffusion weighted image. The gradient directions were corrected by the rotation component of the transformation 44. Rician noise in the DWI was reduced by an adaptive noise filtering method 45. Diffusion tensors were calculated The waist-to-hip ratio was considered higher than normal if it was at least 0.9 62.\nusing a nonlinear least squares estimation. Subsequently, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion maps were computed for each patient. All patients-data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT 46.\nTo reduce the risk of partial volume effects, we focused our analysis on the central parts of the white matter tracts, for which a population-based fractional anisotropymap was created and skeletonized (fractional anisotropy was thresholded at 0.2) 47. The resulting fractional anisotropy-based skeleton represents the centre of all major tracts in the population-based template. For each individual patient, its aligned fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion maps were projected onto this fractional anisotropy skeleton (Fig. 1) 47. Subsequently, each fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion maps were averaged to a white matter summary statistic or used for tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in the functional software library (FSL) 47,48.\nAnatomical images were used for grey matter, white matter and CSF segmentation by SPM8 49. The intracranial volume (ICV) was computed by summing the grey matter, white matter and CSF volumes. The relative total brain volume was defined as the ratio of total brain volume (summing the grey matter and white matter) over ICV.\nIn addition to white matter summary statistics for each individual DTI metric, normal appearing white matter (NAWM) DTI metrics were derived in which white matter lesion areas (hyperintense on 3D-FLAIR) were masked out (Fig. 1) 50. This involved training a random-forest classification algorithm on a manual annotation set of 20 individuals with varying lesion load, to detect the presence of lesions 51. This was then applied in the current dataset to identify regions of white matter lesions in HIVþ patients and controls.",

To examine possible accelerated aging effects in HIVþ patients, interaction effects between age and HIV serostatus on WMFA and WMMD measures were assessed.\nTo identify confounders and determinants (intoxicants, comorbidities and risk factors, biomarkers of immune activation and HIVART-related factors) of WMFA and WMMD measures, stepwise linear regression analyses were performed (P  0.05 probability to enter and P  0.1 probability to remove), while adjusting for age, brain volume and scanner system.\nTo examine associations of WMFA and WMMD measures with cognition, HIVþ patients were classified as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired by MNC. Group comparison on cognitive status was performed on the WMFA and WMMD measures, adjusted for age, brain volume and scanner system. The test statistic of the MNC method was Hotellings T 2 . To create a continuous measure of cognitive function and prevent a bimodal distribution, each Hotellings T 2 statistic was subtracted from the lowest Hotellings T 2 statistic and multiplied by the direction of deviation (i.e. positive or negative deviation reflecting better or poorer cognition as compared with the control group). Associations of this transformed statistic with WMFA and WMMD, were examined by linear regression, adjusting for age, brain volume and scanner system.\nTo provide spatial information on significant findings of white matter DTI metrics, TBSS group comparison and correlational analyses were performed, while adjusting for age, brain volume and scanner system. Multiple comparisons were corrected for by using permutation tests. This was implemented using the Randomise software within FSL, employing the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), in which P-values 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were subsequently repeated with NAWM DTI metrics.\nMNC was performed using R statistical software 52, whereas remaining analyses were done in SPSS (version 20.0; IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).",

HIV-associated cognitive deficits were not found to be associated with white matter structure alterations.",

    },
    "Interpretation of findings": {
      "text": "The diffuse pattern of altered diffusion properties found in HIVþ patients relative to highly comparable HIV-uninfected controls may indicate subtle but widespread white matter injury. Consistent findings of alterations in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion have been reported previously in middle-aged and older HIVþ patients compared with healthy controls 14,16,19,22,23,26,27,29,30,33,34,36. The origin of the subtlety of our findings compared with previous studies may be two-fold. First, all HIV-patients in our cohort were adequately treated on cART. Second, healthy controls were carefully matched on lifestyle and comorbid disease. Comparing to previous work, one might infer that improved treatment diminishes HIVinduced white matter structure alterations. The fact that two comparable studies which exclusively included aviraemic HIVþ patients did not report white matter structure alterations might be due to smaller sample sizes as compared with our study 35,39. Furthermore, one of the studies also excluded all possible comorbidities 39 and therefore may have excluded HIVeffects, as HIV itself has been reported to be independently associated with cardiovascular disease and many other comorbidities 10.\nIn addition to the effects of HIV serostatus and ageing, we found independent associations of hypertension and dyslipidemia with white matter structure alterations. Effects of hypertension were particularly consistent, which might be partly HIV-mediated, as increased cardiovascular risk has been frequently reported in HIV 10. Evidence for possible accelerated CNS ageing could not be derived from this cross-sectional analysis. Follow-up measurements are currently underway and may provide more insight into a possible interaction effect of age and HIV serostatus on white matter structure alterations in adequately treated HIVþ patients.\nThe total duration of immune deficiency (i.e. the number of years spent with CD4 þ cell count lower than 500 cellsml) was also strongly associated with white matter structure alterations. This may reflect irreversible damage that has occurred during immune deficiency by both direct viral and host-derived proinflammatory factors. Previously reported persistent white matter injury in HIVþ patients with partial immune reconstitution, provides evidence that such damage could be permanent in nature 33. Moreover, the use of cARTand higher current CD4 þ cell counts have been associated with higher fractional anisotropy values 40, suggesting that prevention of immune deficiency may avert irreversible white matter structure damage. Among HIVþ patients in the cART-era, effects of cumulative exposure to immune deficiency are possibly insufficiently captured by the nadir CD4 þ cell count 33343539,40. Subtle white matter structure alterations may be better captured by a measure of cumulative exposure to immune deficiency, as used in this study. These findings provide additional support for the current HIV treatment guidelines that stress the importance of preventing immune deficiency and initiating antiretroviral therapy in all patients irrespective of CD4 þ cell count 53.\nPretreatment with nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors before the start of cART was associated with white matter structure injury, but this relationship seemed to be driven by the duration of past immune deficiency. This is compatible with HIVþ patients diagnosed in the pre cARTera to have been more likely to have experienced more prolonged periods of advanced immune deficiency.\nAlthough associations between systemic markers of immune activation and inflammation (i.e. sCD14 and sCD16) with white matter structure alterations were not observed, ongoing proinflammatory reactions within the CNS affecting white matter structure cannot be ruled out. Postmortem studies have reported persistent levels of elevated markers of microgliamacrophage activation in cART treated HIV cases 54, suggesting proinflammatory reactions may not be normalized in the context of cART and that the continued presence of neuro-and myelinotoxic cytokines may induce subtle white matter alterations, such as those observed in the current study.\nAlthough several studies have previously reported white matter structure alterations to be related to HIVassociated cognitive impairment 24,27,28,31,34,37, others did not report such an relationship 26,30,35,39. An association between white matter structure alterations and cognitive deficits was not observed in the current study. The magnitude of the effect of HIV-serostatus on cognition and white matter structure alterations in the current study was small; hence a possible relationship between the two would likely be subtle. Note that in absolute numbers, our group of 16 cognitively impaired patients is of comparable size to the CHARTER cohort, reporting 10 impaired patients 28.\nThe successful treatment of HIVþ patients and exclusion of otherwise confounding factors are in our opinion key to the subtlety of effects we report. If white matter structure is to be used as a biomarker to predict cognitive impairment and subsequent deterioration in ageing HIVþ patients, then larger, multicentre cohorts with hundreds of patients are needed. Also, sufficient time between follow-up measurements is required in future studies, as cognitive decline was not related to a significant increase of mean diffusion in HIVþ patients after one year of follow-up 27.\nThe presence of white matter lesions of presumed vascular origin is associated with findings of white matter structure alterations 55. Greater microstructural alterations have been reported in HIVþ patients with white matter lesions, compared with HIVþ patients with no lesions 31. Although some studies have carefully reviewed the analysed regions for white matter lesions 15,26, we studied the NAWM separately by patientwise excluding lesion areas. All effects persisted in whole brain measures.",

      "text": "Although controls enrolled in this study had very similar demographics and lifestyle, HIVþ patients reported more lifetime tobacco exposure and controls more ecstasy use. Moreover, although HIVþ patients had lower BMI, they fulfilled more often the criteria for central obesity, and showed increased monocyte activation (i.e. higher levels of soluble CD14) and lower CD4 þ CD8 þ ratio. Such vascular risk factors and increased immune activation are known complications of HIV-infection or its treatment. However, none of these parameters were related to white matter structure alterations in the current study. About one-third of HIVþ patients and controls were scanned on a different scanning system due to a scanner replacement. We have adjusted for the scanner effects by factoring its effects in the statistical model. When analysing the subset of patients on a single machine, the effects within HIVþ patients are persistent, the relation between CD4 þ cell count less than 500 cellsml and mean diffusion remains significant (beta ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.005). When comparing groups, effects sizes are of equal sign but slightly smaller, and P-values thus higher (fractional anisotropy: beta ¼ -0.010, P ¼ 0.19; mean diffusion: beta ¼ 0.11, P ¼ 0.09).",

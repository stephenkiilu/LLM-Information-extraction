    "abstract": "A few studies report that parental longevity is associated with preserved cognition and physical function and lower risk of Alzheimers disease. However, data on structural neuroimaging correlates of parental longevity and its spatial distribution are limited. This study aims to examine relationships of parental longevity with regional brain structure and to explore sex differences. We identified 12,970 UK Biobank participants (mean age  64.4, 51.5women) with data on parental longevity, regional gray matter volumes, and white matter microstructure. Participants were categorized based on whether at least one parent lived to age 85 or older or neither parent survived to age 85. Associations of parental longevity, maternal, and paternal longevity with each neuroimaging marker of interest were examined using linear regression, adjusted for demographics, APOE e4 status, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic conditions. Compared to participants whose both parents died before 85 (43), those with at least one parent surviving to 85 (57) had greater volumes in hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal lobe, and primary sensorimotor cortex and had lower mean diffusivity in posterior thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus. Associations were prominent with maternal longevity. Adjustment for cardiometabolic conditions did not affect observed associations except mean diffusivity in posterior thalamic radiation. There were no structural differences in other areas. Parental longevity is associated with preserved brain structure localized in primary sensorimotor cortex and temporal areas including hippocampus. These relationships are prominent with maternal longevity. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether changes in these brain structures account for the association between parental longevity and dementia.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Over the past decade, a number of studies demonstrated that parental longevity is associated with better health and survival of offspring, and it was suggested that both genetic and shared environmental factors contribute to such association (Adams et al. 2008;Atkins et al. 2016;Barzilai et al. 2001;Bucci et al. 2016;Gubbi et al. 2017;Ikeda et al. 2006;Shadyab et al. 2018;Terry et al. 2007;Yarnell et al. 2003). Recent GWAS point to loci associated with parental longevity that play key roles in cellular senescence, inflammation, and lipid metabolisms and cardiovascular conditions (Pilling et al. 2017;Timmers et al. 2019). Indeed, individuals with long-lived parents are more likely to have more favorable health profiles and healthy aging, such as better lipid profiles, a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, compared to those whose parents did not survive to an older age.\nA few recent studies have reported that parental longevity is associated with less cognitive decline, lower odds of white matter hyperintensities, and lower risk of Alzheimers disease (Andersen et al. 2018;Dutta et al. 2014;Lipton et al. 2010;Murabito et al. 2014). However, it is still unclear whether parental longevity predicts cognitive-related outcomes in offspring through specific structural and functional brain changes.\nPublished neuroimaging studies focused on global measures of brain structure, such as white matter hyperintensities and total brain volume, one specific region of interest instead of mapping specific gray matter and white matter areas (Murabito et al. 2014;Altmann-Schneider et al. 2012). Hence, whether structural changes in some areas of the brain gray and white matter are more strongly associated with parental longevity than others remains unanswered. Recent studies suggest that parental longevity is associated with memory, attention, and also physical performance, such as gait speed (Dutta et al. 2014;Murabito et al. 2014;Ayers et al. 2014;Ayers et al. 2017). These findings raise the possibility that parental longevity is associated with brain structure localized in areas important for memory and motor function, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the gray matter and the superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus of the white matter. Notably, neuroimaging in one of the published studies was performed 1 or 1.5 T, and the low resolution of this technology limits the accuracy of regional measures (Murabito et al. 2014). Also, whether parental longevity is associated with brain microstructure measured by the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which may be more sensitive to detect subtle structural changes than conventional MRI imaging, is unknown (Basser et al. 1994;Pierpaoli and Basser 1996).\nOne interesting and relatively unexplored question is whether the effect of parental longevity on brain health is different between men and women. One recent study reported that the mothers longevity is associated with a lower risk of dementia while the fathers longevity is not (Bigarella et al. 2014), suggesting possible mechanisms of sex differences in health care andor a role of maternal transmission of mitochondrial DNA mutations or heteroplasmy.\nIn this study, we aimed to (1) examine the relationship of parental longevity with neuroimaging markers of brain structure using a multimodal neuroimaging approach, including MRI volumetric measures and microstructural measures by DTI; (2) to determine the spatial distribution of gray and white matter areas associated with parental longevity; (3) to examine possible contributing factors of nature (APOE genotype), nurture (smoking status, physical activity), and health profile (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, white matter hyperintensities) on the relationships between parental longevity and multimodal neuroimaging markers; and (4) to test sex differences.",

Detailed imaging acquisition and quality control are available on the UK Biobank website (Brain Imaging Documentation V1.3; http:www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).\nImaging parameters T1-weighted imaging was performed using a threedimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. The sequence parameters were as follows: voxel 1.0  1.0  1.0 mm; field of view 208  256  256 matrix; inversion time 880 ms; repetition time 2000 ms.\nT2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scans were obtained using a three-dimensional SPACE sequence.

Associations remained largely unchanged after further adjustment for APOE e4, smoking status, physical activity, history of MI, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and total white matter hyperintensity volume (Table 2, Model 2-4). Volumes in other ROIs, including inferior, superior, and middle frontal gyri, precuneus, superior parietal lobe, inferior temporal lobe, putamen, caudate, and thalamus, were not statistically different between those whose both parents died before 85 and those with at least one parent surviving to 85 (Table 2).\nCompared to participants whose both parents died before 85, those with at least one parent surviving to 85 had lower MD in posterior thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus, after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, APOE e4, smoking status, and physical Total white matter hyperintensity volume, cm 3 5.3 (6.2) 4.9 (6.1)\nIPAQ International Physical Activity Questionnaire, MET metabolic equivalent activity (Table 3, Model 1-3).

The associations of parental longevity with MD in the anterior and superior thalamic radiations were marginally significant (Table 3, Model 1; p  0.005 and p  0.006, respectively). DTI measures in other white matter ROIs were not statistically different between those whose both parents died before 85 and those with at least one parent surviving to 85 (Table 3).\nNeuroimaging markers that were significantly associated with the combined parental longevity remained similarly associated with maternal longevity, while some associations with paternal longevity were attenuated (Table 4).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This cross-sectional study that included information on parental longevity in more than 12,000 adults who underwent a brain MRI scan demonstrates for the first time that parental longevity is associated with preserved brain structure localized in areas important for memory and motor function, both on a macro-and microstructural level. These associations are robust albeit moderate, especially for memory-related areas, independent of demographics, APOE e4 status, lifestyle factors, and health profile. Interestingly, the effect of maternal longevity on brain structural integrity appears to be stronger than paternal longevity for some specific areas.\nOur work lays a foundation for parental longevity being linked to brain aging and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We advanced prior knowledge by examining multiple brain areas of interest that are important for cognition and sensorimotor function, by examining volumetric measures of gray matter and microstructural integrity of white matter, and by accounting for potential contributing factors of brain health. The strong associations with parental longevity The italic number indicates significant associations at p  0.005 PA physical activity, WMH white matter hyperintensity are localized in the primary sensorimotor cortex and selected temporal area including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and uncinate fasciculus, suggesting a specific pattern of inheritance for the brain. These findings confirm early reports suggesting that parental longevity is associated with preserved cognition and physical performance (Dutta et al. 2014;Murabito et al. 2014;Ayers et al. 2014;Ayers et al. 2017). Previous research on parental longevity and brain health has mostly focused on global white matter, such as total white matter volume or total white matter hyperintensity volume, while regional white matter microstructural abnormalities were not addressed. We filled in this gap in knowledge by examining specific white matter tracts using two metrics, FA and MD. Previous research has suggested that the use of a combination of DTI metrics may advance the understanding of tissue pathology (Alexander et al. 2007). FA describes the directionality of the white matter tracts, and MD quantifies the diffusion magnitude of water molecules within tracts. Several conditions may lead to increased MD, such as increased water tissue, inflammation, and necrosis (Alexander et al. 2007). We observed that the associations were present in MD and not in FA, which may indicate parental longevity may protect against inflammation and cell necrosis in the central nervous system.\nOf multiple white matter tracts examined in this study, parental longevity may be specifically associated with the uncinate fasciculus and projection tracts connecting the thalamus to cortical gray matter areas, where the primary sensorimotor cortex and middle and medial temporal lobes are located. Specifically, the posterior thalamic radiation runs between the caudal part of the thalamus and parietal and occipital lobes. The superior thalamic radiation runs between the ventral part of the thalamus and the primary sensorimotor cortex. The anterior thalamic radiation connects the anterior and middle portions of the thalamus with the frontal lobe (George and Das 2020). The uncinate fasciculus is localized in the anterior portion of the temporal lobe and also links to the frontal lobe. Notably, associations with these DTI markers except the uncinate fasciculus MD were attenuated after additional adjustment for cardiometabolic conditions, such as a history of MI, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and white matter hyperintensities which were considered of vascular origin. Because cardiovascular burden has been associated with low white matter microstructural integrity and structural decline (Alves et al. 2012;Hoogenboom et al. 2014;Hsu et al. 2012;Papageorgiou et al. 2017;Reijmer et al. 2013;Williams et al. 2019), these cardiometabolic conditions may account for some of the observed associations. It is also possible that cardiometabolic conditions are shared causal pathways underlying parental longevity and brain aging.\nAnother interesting finding is that these neuroimaging correlates are more prominent with maternal longevity than those with parental longevity. Limited data have shown that maternal longevity, but not paternal longevity, predicts a lower risk of dementia. Possible mechanisms, including maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA mutations andor heteroplasmy, were proposed All models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, and APOE e4. For regional gray matter volume, models were additionally adjusted for total brain volume (normalized to head size). The italic number indicates significant associations at p  0.005\nbut not yet investigated. One recent study has reported a significant association of mitochondrial DNA copy number between centenaries and their offspring, suggesting a higher mitochondrial DNA copy number is likely inheritable (He et al. 2016). Future studies are warranted to confirm sex differences in the relationship of parental longevity with brain structure and investigate underlying mechanisms. It is important to note that neuroimaging markers localized in the temporal lobe, including volumes of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, remained significant with paternal longevity. We also note that there may be a potential power issue as the longevity is not the same for both parents (maternal longevity 43; parental longevity 26). However, given that associations were similar in some areas and different in other areas, the observed sex differences may not be due to the power. This study has limitations. The cross-sectional design does not imply any causation. Although setting the significance level at p  0.005 to correct for multiple testing reduced the chance of false-positive findings, we may have missed some associations. UK Biobank participants tend to be healthier than the general population at study entry (Fry et al. 2017). This study has several strengths. A comprehensive examination of both gray matter and white matter allows us to determine the spatial distribution with parental longevity. Both FA and MD metrics provide rich information on white matter microstructural integrity. This study has a large imaging sample which provides good statistical power. The wealth of other factors, such as genotype, lifestyle, and health conditions, allows us to investigate the strength of these relationships.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Non-Latino Black adults have greater risk for Alzheimers dementia compared to non-Latino White adults, possibly due to factors disproportionally affecting Black adults including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic peripheral inflammation is implicated in both Alzheimers dementia and CVD and is known to impact cognition and cerebral white matter, yet little work has examined these associations by race. This study examined associations between inflammation, cognition, and cerebral white matter generally, and by race. Methods: Eighty-six non-demented older Black and White participants (age  69.03; 50 female; 45 Black participants) underwent fasting venipuncture, cognitive testing, and MRI. Serum was assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 1-beta. Cognitive domains included memory, executive function, and attentioninformation processing. MRI measures included white matter hyperintensity volumes (WMH) and quantification of white matter integrity in areas outside WMHs via DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity, as well as multi-component relaxometry derived myelin water fraction (MWF). Results: Black and White participants did not differ on age, sex, or CVD risk. Separate linear regression models adjusting for relevant confounders revealed that higher IL-6 associated with lower executive function and higher CRP levels associated with lower FA and MWF. Stratified analyses revealed that these association were significant for Black participants only. Discussion: These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation is inversely associated with select cognitive domains and white matter integrity (but not WMHs), particularly in older Black adults. It is important to consider race when investigating inflammatory associates of brain and behavior.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Given the number of unsuccessful pharmacological trials in Alzheimers dementia (Alzheimers Association, 2019), researchers have turned toward alternative approaches to prevent Alzheimers dementia prior to its onset, including identification of modifiable risk factors that have established interventions, such as cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs). Several CVD-RFs, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, have been linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimers dementia (DeRight et al., 2015); however, the underlying mechanisms driving these associations have not been fully elucidated. This is particularly true for non-Latino Black adults, who are historically underrepresented in scientific research despite disparities in Alzheimers dementia and CVD-RFs. In fact, disproportionately higher levels of uncontrolled CVD-RFs in Black adults (Barnes and Bennett, 2014;Howard et al., 2017) are hypothesized to contribute to their greater risk for Alzheimers dementia compared to non-Latino White adults (Mayeda et al., 2016). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationships of these risk factors to cognition in normal and pathological aging both across and within race is an urgent public health need.\nOne potential underlying mechanism to explain differential risk for CVD-RFs and their impact on Alzheimers dementia in older Black adults is the known chronically elevated levels of peripheral inflammation in Black adults compared with White adults (Nazmi and Victora, 2007). Peripheral inflammatory markers are elevated in aforementioned conditions more common in older Black adults including CVD-RFs (Golia et al., 2014;Bourassa and Sbarra, 2017) and Alzheimers dementia (Perry, 2004); however, the directionality of inflammation impacting CVD-RFs or vice versa remains unclear. Peripheral inflammatory markers are thought to communicate with the brain, specifically microglia, via several pathways including active transport of inflammatory cytokines across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), signaling across intact BBB, and circumventricular organs (Perry, 2004;Holmes, 2013). In turn, microglia become activated and more prone to release pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to foreign matter such as β-amyloid (Heneka et al., 2015;Bourassa and Sbarra, 2017). With rising βamyloid accumulation, microglia become highly sensitive to activation, aggravate the β-amyloid clearing process, and chronic central inflammation ensues. This may serve as a catalyst for cerebral white matter damage (Raj et al., 2017) and cognitive decline that may lead to dementia (Perry, 2004;Heneka et al., 2015). In fact, prior studies in older White adults show direct associations between elevated peripheral inflammation and dementia (Holmes et al., 2009;Swardfager et al., 2010) as well as alterations in cerebral white matter and cognition (Wersching et al., 2010;Jefferson et al., 2011;Bettcher et al., 2012;Satizabal et al., 2012;Tegeler et al., 2016). There are few studies examining these associations in older Black adults.\nTo date, we are aware of nine studies investigating peripheral inflammation and brain aging that have included non-Latino Black participants as greater than 25 of the study sample. Three studies did not expressly examine race; however, they did report associations between higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and (1) lower memory and visuospatial function (Noble et al., 2010), (2) greater white matter damage in the form of white matter hyperintensities (WMH; Raz et al., 2012), and (3) lower white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; Bettcher et al., 2015). These results are similar to those reported for predominantly White cohorts (Wersching et al., 2010;Jefferson et al., 2011;Bettcher et al., 2012;Satizabal et al., 2012;Tegeler et al., 2016). Of the six studies that explicitly investigated race, two cross-sectional studies reported that higher inflammation, measured by CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (Windham et al., 2014;Goldstein et al., 2015), was associated with lower cognition in older Black adults more so than older White adults. Two longitudinal studies showed no racial differences on the effect of inflammation on cognitive change (Yaffe et al., 2003;Beydoun et al., 2018). One longitudinal study found that greater inflammation in midlife predicted poorer white matter integrity, i.e., greater mean diffusivity (MD), two decades later in Black adults more so than White adults (Walker et al., 2017); however, this same group did not show racial differences between change in inflammation from middle to late-life and late-life WMH or DTI-derived white matter integrity (FA; Walker et al., 2018). While these studies and others with smaller percentages of Black participants in the study sample (Zahodne et al., 2018) contribute to the much-needed literature on the relationships between inflammation and brain aging in Black adults, results are mixed, and newer neuroimaging techniques may further enhance our understanding of cerebral white matter associates.\nThe aims of the current study are two-fold. One, we will examine whether markers of inflammation, including CRP, IL-6, and IL1-beta (IL1-β), are associated with global cognitive function and cognitive domains of memory, executive function, and attentioninformation processing in a cohort of older Black and White adults, both generally and by race. We hypothesize that higher levels of inflammation will be associated with worse cognition globally and in memory, executive function, and attentioninformation processing speed, and that these associations will be present in Black participants more so than White participants. Two, we will determine whether CRP, IL-6, and IL1-β are associated with cerebral white matter, generally and by race, using a series of neuroimaging techniques to assess white matter damage (WMH volumes) and white matter integrity, including DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and MD, and a newer metric of underlying white matter microstructure -myelin water fraction (MWF) derived from multi-component driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1T2 (mcDESPOT). We hypothesize that higher levels of inflammation will be associated with higher WMH volumes, lower FA, higher MD, and lower MWF, particularly in Black participants when compared with White participants.",

The study was approved by the UIC Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with written informed consent obtained from all participants. All requisite IRB and institutional data use agreements were in place prior to data analysis at the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center.\nAs outlined previously (Boots et al., 2019;Bronas et al., 2019), adults aged 60 years or older living in the Chicagoland area were recruited via community outreach. Interested individuals underwent telephone screening to determine initial study eligibility. At this screen, exclusion criteria consisted of self-reported currentpast history of neurological conditions including Alzheimers or other dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinsons disease or other movement disorders, stroke, epilepsy, or Axis I or II disorders, a history of head injury or loss of consciousness, a presentpast history of substance abuse or dependence, current psychotropic medication use, or contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). History of stable (e.g., diabetes) or remitted medical illness (e.g., cancer) was not an exclusionary factor. Individuals were not eligible if they received cognitive testing in the year prior to their participation in this study.\nIndividuals who passed this telephone screen underwent a more intensive in-person evaluation of inclusionexclusion criteria. This secondary screening consisted of affective and cognitive screens including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) conducted by a trained research assistant and followed by an evaluation by a psychiatrist, blind to all screening information, who administered the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Final inclusion criteria consisted of an absence of psychiatric symptoms based on the SCID, a score 8 on the HAM-D, a MMSE score 24, and absence of subjective memory complaints.\nThe overall study sample consisted of 121 individuals. Given that the current analyses focused on associations of inflammatory markers with cognition and cerebral white matter in non-Latino White and Black adults, we excluded 18 individuals who self-identified as from a Latinx background. Additionally, we excluded 17 participants that did not have at least two of the three inflammatory markers used in this study. Thus, the final analytic sample consisted of 86 non-Latino Black (n  39) and White (n  47) participants.",

Specifically, pVIQ from the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading was used as a proxy for educational quality, a more informative means of assessing educational attainment than years of education in raciallyethnically diverse samples (Carvalho et al., 2015). Given the relationship between CVD-RFs and peripheral inflammation (Golia et al., 2014), we wanted to ensure models were detecting as specific an effect as possible of inflammation on our outcome variables that was not attributable to CVD-RFs. Thus, we utilized the FSRP 10-year risk of stroke that incorporates age, sex, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive therapy, diabetes, smoking, cardiovascular disease, and atrial fibrillation to measure CVD-RF burden (Dufouil et al., 2017). Data for the FSRP-10 was obtained via medical history, physical examination, two seated blood pressure readings separated by 5 min, and an electrocardiogram conducted at the UIC CRC.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This cross-sectional study revealed racial distinctions in the associations between peripheral inflammatory markers, cognition, and cerebral white matter in non-demented, nondepressed older adults. Specifically, after adjustment for a priori covariates, higher IL-6 was associated with lower global cognition and executive functioning, and higher CRP was associated with lower FA and MWF in NAWM. All associations were driven by Black participants rather than White participants. Together, results point toward differential relationships between inflammatory markers and brain-behavior in older Black and White adults. Our work adds support to the possibility that inflammation may be a risk factor for cognitive decline and more subtle markers of adverse brain health, particularly in Black adults.\nThe current study adds to the literature in several ways. First, our finding associating IL-6 with global cognition and executive functioning in a racially diverse sample extends prior results historically seen in majority White cohorts (Marsland et al., 2006;Mooijaart et al., 2013;Tegeler et al., 2016) to indicate that inflammation is associated with cognition in both White participants and Black participants. Second, although there were no statistically significant differences across race, the fact that these associations, when stratified by race, were driven by Black participants supports prior cross-sectional reports that older Black adults with higher levels of IL-6 exhibited poorer executive function when compared with older White adults (Windham et al., 2014). Lastly, the lack of significant results for other cognitive domains is similar to previous reports of IL-6 associating with executive function but not memory or attention in some (Mooijaart et al., 2013;Windham et al., 2014), but not all studies involving older Black adults (Jordanova et al., 2007). While differences in defining cognitive domains may help explain conflicting results, e.g., executive function and attentioninformation processing often include similar neuropsychological tests across studies (Chan et al., 2008), it is also possible that inflammation may impact executive function more so than memory or attention. More work is needed to support the findings in our and other studies (Mooijaart et al., 2013;Windham et al., 2014).\nOur study also provided new evidence regarding the relationship between inflammatory markers and white matter integrity across, as well as within race. The inverse relationship between CRP and FA in NAWM in the current studys diverse sample is consistent with some -but not all (Gu et al., 2017) -cross-sectional (Wersching et al., 2010) and longitudinal (Bettcher et al., 2015;Walker et al., 2018) studies of majority White cohorts. Furthermore, our work expands upon the only other study to date reporting racial differences in CRP and white matter integrity, i.e., DTI-derived MD (Walker et al., 2017) to include an examination of underlying white matter microstructural integrity (i.e., MWF in NAWM). While our results suggest that both White and Black participants have lower MD as well as MWF with higher inflammation, these full sample findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and should be interpreted with caution. Despite non-significant interactions by race on these same variables, stratified analyses suggest that higher levels of CRP, particularly in older Black adults more so than White older adults, are also associated with lower levels of white matter integrity, more specifically, myelin integrity. Together with the fact that we and some (Wersching et al., 2010) but not all (Satizabal et al., 2012;Walker et al., 2018) investigators have failed to find a relationship between CRP and WMH suggests that gross metrics like WMH may be too far along in the neurodegenerative process to show an association with inflammation. In contrast, the association between inflammation and white matter integrity, especially myelin integrity in NAWM, may signal a relationship of vulnerability to or milder tissue changes of overt white matter damage as previously shown in head-to-head neuroimaging to neuropathological comparisons within NAWM and WMH (Bronge et al., 2002;Simpson et al., 2007). Longitudinal work is needed to fully elucidate the role of inflammation in the chronicity andor severity of white matter degeneration across brain tissue, especially in older Black adults.\nWhile relationships between IL-6 and cognition, and separately, CRP and cerebral white matter integrity were observed, no inflammatory marker showed associations with both cognition and cerebral white matter. It has been suggested that peripheral IL-6 may be more impactful on cognitive function, executive function specifically, than CRP (Mooijaart et al., 2011(Mooijaart et al., , 2013)), which is consistent with our findings. Additionally, while IL-6 and CRP are mechanistically linked in the pro-inflammatory response, these inflammatory markers also have distinct signaling pathways (McFadyen et al., 2018). For example, IL-6 engages microglia and upregulates the production of β-amyloid (Wyss-Coray and Rogers, 2012), while CRP targets not only β-amyloid but also brain vasculature (McFadyen et al., 2018). Thus, CRP has an active role in the pro-inflammatory response to cerebrovascular disease including ischemia and atherosclerosis (McFadyen et al., 2018), diseases that negatively impact white matter integrity and underlying white matter microstructure (Papma et al., 2014). Together, these studies provide potential explanations for our results linking IL-6 with cognition and CRP with white matter integrity and demyelination in NAWM; however, there is limited work to explain why these patterns were specific to Black adults.\nFrom a clinical perspective, CVD-RFs and psychosocial stressors have long been hypothesized to contribute to racial disparities in brain aging (Barnes and Bennett, 2014). We tested our hypotheses with and without (data not shown) CVD-RF burden as a covariate; CVD-RF burden as measured by the FSRP-10 did not alter our results. It is possible, however, that related CVD-RFs not accounted for by the FSRP-10, such as obesity and hypercholesterolemia, are playing a role, especially given their greater likelihood in Black adults (Barnes and Bennett, 2014;Howard et al., 2017). Psychosocial stressors, such as lower educational quality (Liu et al., 2014), institutionalized racism and experiences of discrimination (Pascoe and Smart Richman, 2009), and financial andor socioeconomic fragility (Shaked et al., 2019) may also play important roles in associations between inflammation, cognition, and cerebral white matter. We adjusted for pVIQ as a proxy for educational quality, given significant racial differences in years of education in our sample. While educational quality was associated with select inflammatory markers and global cognitive functioning, it did not account for observed racial differences, suggesting that factors beyond educational quality may be important to consider. For example, higher CRP has been associated with higher levels of selfreported discrimination in older Black adults (Lewis et al., 2010), and CRP has been shown to moderate the association between experiences of discrimination and cognition in older Black adults (Zahodne et al., 2018). It is possible that the inclusion of other social determinants of health may have yielded different results. Relationships between financial andor socioeconomic fragility, inflammation and brain health may also be influenced by the intersection of sex and race (Gruenewald et al., 2009) and may be mediated, in part, by select CVD-RFs (Akrivos et al., 2020). Thus, future work is needed incorporating not only additionaland perhaps more targeted -CVD-RFs, but critical psychosocial stressors into a comprehensive longitudinal investigation of inflammatory markers and brain-behavior if we are to fully understand race-related patterns in our and others results.\nWhile this study has several strengths, it is not without limitations. The cross-sectional nature of our analyses neither allows for a determination of causality in reported relationships nor a definitive explanation of the mechanisms for these effects. Additionally, the high average years of education of our sample, regardless of race, may limit generalizability to the larger population given that only one third of United States adults 65 and older hold a bachelors or higher degree (Ryan and Bauman, 2016). Stratified analyses -originally justified given our a priori hypotheses and limitations to interaction analyses in health disparities research (Ward et al., 2019) should, nonetheless, be interpreted with caution given that there were no between-group differences in inflammatory marker predictor variables and only significant racial differences in two of five outcome variables. Further, null findings with IL1β may have been due to a more limited sample size for this marker, particularly in Black participants. While standardized blood draws were completed in the morning, we did not ask participants about recent illnesses that are known to impact inflammatory marker levels. Furthermore, we did not ask participants about experiences of discrimination or financial andor socioeconomic fragility and lacked the sample size to investigate the intersectionality of sex and race in our work. Lastly, while excluding individuals with factors associated with inflammation including depression allowed for stronger, unbiased conclusions regarding inflammation and healthy brain aging, it may have limited the variability seen in our inflammatory markers.\nStrengths of this study include our comprehensive assessment of cognition and multi-modal interrogation of cerebral white matter damage and integrity, including a novel neuroimaging marker of myelin water fraction. This marker allowed for the detection of subtle differences in white matter that otherwise may go undetected. Finally, our study contributes to a small, but growing literature attempting to understand the increased risk for Alzheimers dementia and associated CVD-RF burden in Black adults.\nOur work emphasizes the importance of incorporating race into understanding associations in peripheral inflammation as related to cognition and cerebral white matter in older adults. More specifically, there are detectable associations between IL-6 and cognition as well as CRP and cerebral white matter integrity in a non-demented, non-depressed sample of older adults, particularly Black adults. By incorporating subtle metrics of white matter integrity and microstructure within NAWM, the findings of this study also point toward the utility of sensitive neuroimaging markers, such as mcDESPOT, in at risk but not overtly damaged cerebral white matter. The differential associations between inflammation, cognition, and white matter seen by race in this study, if confirmed and extended by longitudinal study, may provide more nuanced understanding of racial disparities in brain aging and Alzheimers dementia and point toward the role of reducing inflammatory biomarker levels as potential clinical targets for increasing health equity in brain aging.",

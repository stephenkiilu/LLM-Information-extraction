    "abstract": "Background: Clinico-pathological distinction of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) can be challenging at clinic presentation. In particular, cross-sectional neuroimaging signatures across the logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA) variants are difficult to establish, with longitudinal profiles showing greater divergence. Objective: Assess longitudinal propagation of white matter degradation in lvPPA and svPPA to determine disease progression over time, and whether this reflects distinct underlying pathology. Method: A cohort of 27 patients with dementia (12 lvPPA; 15 svPPA) and 12 healthy controls were assessed at baseline and 1-year follow-up on the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-Revised and Sydney Language Battery. Diffusion weighted images were collected at both time-points and analyzed for longitudinal white matter change using DTI-TK and TBSS. Results: LvPPA patients showed a significant decline in naming and repetition, over 1 year, while svPPA patients declined in naming and comprehension. Longitudinal imaging revealed widespread bilateral degradation of white matter tracts in lvPPA over a 1-year period with early involvement of the left posterior inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). SvPPA demonstrated focal left lateralized white matter degradation involving the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and anterior ILF, propagating to the right UF with disease progression. Conclusions: LvPPA and svPPA cohorts showed distinct longitudinal cognitive and white matter profiles. We propose differences in multi-centric and focal white matter dysfunction in lvPPA and svPPA, respectively, reflect underlying pathological differences. The clinical relevance of white matter degradation and mechanisms underlying disease propagation are discussed.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Primary progressive aphasias (PPA) are a clinicopathological heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by the progressive breakdown of language skills and associated brain networks 1. PPA comprises three distinct clinical syndromes: logopenic (lvPPA), semantic (svPPA), and nonfluent (nfvPPA) variants 1,2. Clinical classification into PPA variants occurs at three levels: an initial clinical diagnosis determined by neuropsychological testing, imaging supported structural change, and finally pathological diagnosis either at postmortem or via in vivo PET ligands. Cognitively, lvPPA, svPPA, and nfvPPA variants are characterized by core language deficits involving repetition, comprehension, and agrammatism, respectively 1. Structural neuroimaging studies also highlight distinct, primarily left hemispheric, patterns of atrophy in temporal and frontal lobe structures, across PPA variants 123456.\nPathological diagnosis across all PPAs is less clear with the presence of tau and TAR-DNAbinding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) 7, and Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology reported in each variant 8910. Of all PPA subtypes, lvPPA and svPPA appear to show the most homogenous clinico-pathological mapping, attributed to either AD or FTLD-TDP, respectively 8. The impact of this distinction in pathology can be clearly seen in the localization and degree of structural abnormality in lvPPA and svPPA. Notably, lvPPA show widespread cortical atrophy to posterior regions of the brain, predominantly affecting the left temporo-parietal junction region, while svPPA show focal change associated with the anterior temporal lobes 2,3. However, crosssectional studies comparing white matter integrity in lvPPA and svPPA cohorts often fail to show such a distinction 11,12, likely due to wide distributed white matter changes seen in lvPPA.\nThe current study investigates whether longitudinal white matter assessment allows a better distinction of clinical lvPPA and svPPA. Importantly, a subgroup of patients had confirmed amyloid in vivo biomarkers to allow pathological confirmation. We hypothesized that differences in disease pathology can be detected using a longitudinal analysis approach, and, in particular, patients with lvPPA will show white matter changes across multiple white matter tracts, relative to svPPA, which will show highly localized white matter changes in the temporal lobes only.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "Twenty-seven dementia patients (15 svPPA; 12 lvPPA) and 12 healthy controls were recruited from the Sydney frontotemporal dementia research group (FRONTIER) clinical database. All participants underwent an initial assessment and a 12  2-month follow-up assessment. At each visit, patients underwent a comprehensive assessment, which included a clinical interview, neurological examination, cognitive assessment, and whole-brain MRI. All patients met current clinical diagnostic criteria for probable lvPPA and svPPA 1, and diagnosis was established by consensus among the neurologist, neuropsychologist, and occupational therapist. All participants scans were visually inspected to rule out abnormalities other than atrophy. Participants showing evidence of cerebrovascular disease, including marked small vessel disease, were excluded. Amyloid- deposition using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET was assessed in a subset of PPA patients (9 lvPPA, 6 svPPA). All lvPPA patients scanned were found to be PiB-positive, while svPPA were all negative with the exception of 1 case, which was excluded from analyses. Patient cohorts were matched for age, education, disease duration, and functional disease severity using the Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale (FRS) 13 (Table 1). Patients with a change in diagnosis, atypical features, or absence of progressive language impairment were excluded from the study. Healthy controls were matched for education and all scored above 88100 on the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) screening of general cognition 14. Wholebrain MRI scans were visually assessed for structural and white matter abnormalities; none were reported in this group.",

    "Imaging analysis": {
      "text": "Differences in whole-brain fractional anisotropy (FA) were examined for mean group changes at baseline and follow-up, and longitudinally for interindividual change across time. TBSS 17 was used to perform a skeleton-based analysis of white matter FA, complemented by DTI-TK to provide a tensorbased registration for analyses 16. Tensor based registration of diffusion weighted data is superior to traditional scalar based registration methods in constructing an unbiased spatially normalized brain atlas 18, with good reproducibility of diffusion metrics 19. Serial diffusion-weighted sequences from each participant were averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio before being corrected for eddy current distortions. A binary brain mask was generated 20 from the non-diffusion volume (b 0 ) and used to fit a tensor onto diffusion-weighted images 21. A wholebrain diffusion tensor image from each participant was used to generate study-specific brain atlases in DTI-TK. Group atlases were constructed through an iterative process of initial rigid registration, followed by non-linear registration, to determine the best mapping with each individuals scan using the least amount of deformation 16,19. For the longitudinal analysis, each individuals initial and follow-up scan was co-registered to generate a within-subject template representing a halfway transformation between the two timepoints, prior to construction of a group atlas 19. Group atlases were registered to the Illinois Institute of Technology standard brain atlas, version 4.0 22. Transformation matrices were generated for each stage of registration to create a deformation field that defines the mapping directly from each individuals native scan space to standard space in a single interpolation 19. Individual FA maps are then generated, concatenated, and skeletonized 17 to define the lines of maximum FA, which correspond to the centers of white matter tracts. Group FA skeletons were tested for significant differences using voxel-wise general linear modeling via permutation-based non-parametric testing 23 with 5000 permutations per contrast. Axial and radial diffusivity were also assessed in the same manner. Age was included as a nuisance variable in these analyses. Reported clusters were threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) corrected for multiple comparisons at p  0.05. Delineation of white matter tracts implicated in significant clusters was performed with reference to Johns Hopkins University tractography atlas. Anatomically specific masks of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were generated from the atlas using a threshold of 30, and visually inspected to ensure appropriate coverage. Using these masks, DTI metrics were extracted across both hemispheres, at baseline and follow-up, for atlas-based voxel-wise region of interest (ROI) analyses in patient and control cohorts, using repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS.",

    "Demographics and cognitive testing": {
      "text": "PPA patient groups were well matched for age, education, disease duration, and functional severity (FRS) (Table 1; p values 0.87). The control cohort was older than both patients groups (both p values 0.05). Screening of general cognition (ACE-R: Total) indicated significant group differences (p  0.001) with controls performing the highest. PPA patient groups did not show a significant difference in overall cognitive performance at baseline (p  0.51) or 1-year follow-up (p  0.14), but did show a significant decline over a 1-year period (p values 0.02). Control participants did not show a decline in general cognition in the same period (p  0.37).\nPPA patient groups showed dissociable patterns of performance on language specific tasks, namely, lvPPA scored higher than svPPA on single-word comprehension, naming, and semantic association, but not repetition (Table 1). Overall pattern of impairment for single-word language tasks and performance on the SYD-BAT is consistent with the literature, and all patients performed 2 standard deviations below normative control performance, except for svPPA on single-word repetition 15. At baseline, significant differences in language impairment was observed for naming, repetition, and semantic association (p values 0.05), but not comprehension (p  0.13). At followup, however, significant differences were found for comprehension, as well as repetition and semantic association (p values 0.05), but not naming (p  0.14). This change can be explained by the distinct pattern of progressive impairment on the SYD-BAT subscales between lvPPA and svPPA patients over the 1-year period. PPA patient groups showed dissociable pattern of longitudinal change on SYD-BAT subscales, with a significant decline in repetition for lvPPA (p  0.001), while comprehension and semantic association both declined in svPPA (p values 0.05). In contrast, naming performance on the SYD-BAT worsened significantly in both patient groups over the 1-year period (p values 0.05).",

Patient groups showed dissociation in the localization of white matter abnormality. At baseline, significant focal FA reduction was observed in the posterior region of the left ILF in lvPPA patients. SvPPA patients also showed focal left hemispheric white matter degradation involving the UF and anterior region of the ILF. Progressive deterioration along the length of the left ILF in PPA patient groups, from focal baseline regions of change, is highlighted using the same cross-sectional analysis approach at 1-year follow-up in Supplementary Figure 1.

    "Longitudinal white matter integrity": {
      "text": "Longitudinal inter-individual change in wholebrain white matter integrity was examined within each participant group (Fig. 2). Control participants did not show any significant change in FA over a 1-year followup period. LvPPA patients showed predominantly left hemispheric white matter reduction in FA, involving the UF, ILF, and temporal portion of the SLF. The same pattern of change was detected, albeit to a lesser extent, in the right hemisphere. In addition, significant clusters were detected in the left anterior thalamic radiation and genu of the corpus callosum. SvPPA patients showed the same pattern of focal left hemispheric white matter degradation observed in the cross-sectional analysis, with involvement primarily of the anterior portion of the ILF, and UF. Longitudinal inter-individual comparisons, however, also detected significant clusters of change in the posterior portion of the left ILF and right UF. Similar to lvPPA, significant clusters were also detected in the left anterior thalamic radiation and genu of the corpus callosum in svPPA. A direct contrast of longitudinal inter-individual change between PPA cohorts indicated significantly greater degradation in white matter integrity of the left ILF and SLF in lvPPA, compared to svPPA (Supplementary Figure 2). This pattern is consistent with the longitudinal within group analyses.\nROI analyses examining FA in the UF, ILF, and SLF tracts were carried out using repeated measures ANOVA, comparing tracts, and time, separately for left and right hemispheres across groups. Significant differences were found bilaterally across groups across tracts (all p values 0.001) and time (all p values 0.02). A significant interaction effect was found between group, tract and time for the right hemisphere F(4, 72)  4.15, p  0.004, but not left hemisphere F(4, 72)  2.13, p  0.085. Post-hoc contrasts of the right UF, ILF, and SLF did not significantly differ from controls at baseline or follow-up in PPA patient groups (all p values 0.2). This may be attributed to obtaining a mean FA value for the entire length of these tracts, reducing statistical power. LvPPA patients, however, showed significantly reduced FA across time in the right UF (p  0.01), and a trend toward significance in the right ILF (p  0.07) and SLF (p  0.06) (Table 2). SvPPA patients showed significantly reduced FA across time only in the right UF (p  0.01). In the left hemisphere, significant differences were observed in the left UF and ILF for svPPA patients at baseline and follow-up (all p values 0.01), compared to controls. In contrast, lvPPA patients only showed significant differences in the left ILF at follow-up (p  0.03), compared to controls. Across time, svPPA showed significantly reduced FA in the left UF, ILF, and SLF (all p-values 0.01), while lvPPA showed significant reduction in the left UF and ILF (all p-values 0.05).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study examined longitudinal white matter integrity in lvPPA and svPPA with a focus on the pattern of change over a 1-year period. We uncovered different patterns in the degree of disease propagation in these patient groups, with lvPPA showing relatively diffuse white matter changes, compared to the focal changes observed in svPPA. Both PPA patient groups showed deterioration predominantly in the left hemispheric UF, ILF, and SLF, with additional involvement of their homologous tracts in the contralateral hemisphere. Clinically, the lvPPA and svPPA cohorts were well defined showing clear progressive decline on cognitive tasks and dissociation in degree of impaired speech production and comprehension, respectively. The divergent course of white matter degeneration in lvPPA and svPPA cohorts highlight the possibility of utilizing advanced longitudinal neuroimaging to better clarify underlying pathology in vivo.\nDegradation of the left UF and ILF has consistently been implicated as the main white matter tracts affected across the PPA spectrum 11,24, with some evidence of SLF involvement 25,26. These tracts have also been identified as being critical components of the language network 12,25,27, in particular speech production and semantic retrieval 27,28. A recent cross-sectional study dissociated patterns of white matter change in lvPPA and svPPA 11. Specifically, lvPPA demonstrate widespread left lateralized involvement of the UF and ILF while in svPPA white matter change is predominantly found in ventral tracts, involving bilateral UF and left ILF. Findings from the current study are consistent with the signature of white matter change in svPPA 11,26. Longitudinal imaging, however, revealed a complex pattern of progressive white matter degradation in lvPPA, in particular, dissociating from svPPA. Cross-sectional analyses at baseline demonstrated that early white matter pathology in lvPPA tend to be circumscribed to the posterior tail of the left ILF. Over a 12-month period, however, our analyses showed that changes became widespread, affecting the entire length of the left ILF and involving the UF and SLF in this group. These analyses further demonstrated a similar pattern of white matter changes in the right hemisphere, albeit to a lesser extent. These distinct differences in localization and laterality of white matter abnormality allude to divergent underlying pathology and their propagation in the logopenic and semantic variants of PPA.\nThe focal propagation of white matter dysfunction in svPPA followed a stereotypical pattern along anatomical tracts, suggesting that pathology spreads throughout neighboring axonal tracts 29. In contrast, lvPPA showed a diffuse white matter involvement displaying a less stereotyped pattern of progression that not necessarily follows the trajectory of axonal bundles. This divergent pattern of white matter dysfunction mirrors extensive structural imaging and pathological evidence that shows widespread brain atrophy in lvPPA and circumscribed atrophy in svPPA 3,30, and suggests fundamental mechanistic differences in how pathology spreads. Whereas the primary event driving white matter involvement in svPPA is axonal death (i.e., Wallerian degeneration) derived from focal neuronal death 29, the pattern of white matter involvement in lvPPA seems to be different. Our findings suggest a combined spreading characterized by eccentric white matter changes over time associated with distant multi-centric involvement. This pattern suggests that pathology spreads in two different fashions: directly from neuron to neuron throughout axonal bundles, as well as multiple distant pathological seeds that do not necessarily follow anatomical connections. This pattern highlights the central role of extra-neuronal factors in lvPPA, in particular, the neurotoxic effect of amyloid-. Interestingly, white matter dysfunction was also detected in the genu of the corpus callosum, perhaps presenting an avenue for transcallosal propagation. Further research is needed to investigate the differential regional effect of amyloid and neuronal vulnerability to clarify this issue.\nWhite matter change is increasingly being used to address one of the prevalent issues in the field that remains unresolved from decades of structural imaging, which is the accurate prediction of pathology in vivo. Although important advances in the development of biomarkers have taken place in recent years, clinicopathological correlations at an individual level remain elusive. This issue is particularly acute in PPA cases due to AD, a pathology that can adopt varied neurocognitive patterns and is often present in unclassified PPA cases due to mixed deficits 31. In this sense, white matter changes over time can provide a complementary account that can assist in the identification of AD cases. Current findings suggest the posterior tail of the left ILF is a sensitive marker of white matter change in the early stages of the disease.\nIn the current study, efforts were made in the careful selection of well-defined PPA cases fulfilling diagnostic criteria 1 with the aid of experienced neurologists. A limitation is, however, the lack of genetic testing and pathological confirmation of underlying disease pathology. PiB PET imaging was included as a proxy measure of AD pathology and was available for the majority of lvPPA patients, but only half of svPPA patients. For PPA patients with available PiB imaging, however, all lvPPA were found to be PiB-positive while svPPA were PiB-negative, consistent with expected pathology 8 and interpretation of current imaging findings. All patient and control follow-up assessments occurred within a 2-month margin of the 1-year timepoint, representing genuine longitudinal cognitive and neural change. Robust longitudinal imaging analyses were carried out using tensor-based registration for accurate registration of tract orientation 16 and localization of white matter changes. Current findings should, however, be replicated in a larger sample of PPA patients for reliability.\nIn conclusion, logopenic and semantic variants of PPA demonstrate marked behavioral and neural profiles resulting in progressive deterioration of distinct neural networks. Modeling the progression of white matter degradation along tracts provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathology.",

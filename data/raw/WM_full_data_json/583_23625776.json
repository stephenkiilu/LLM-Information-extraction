    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a precursor to dementia. The amnestic MCI progresses usually to Alzheimer disease. Amnestic MCI multiple domain (md-MCI) seems to progress more rapidly than amnestic MCI single domain (a-MCI). In an attempt to identify patients at risk, we examined white matter changes in MCI subtypes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We also tried to correlate DTI findings to neuropsychological tests. Forty-four amnestic single domain (a-MCI) patients, 19 amnestic multi domain (md-MCI), and 25 cognitively normal (NC) controls were included in the present study. All participants were assessed clinically using a battery of cognitive tests. DTI was performed to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Areas studied were corpus callosum, posterior cingulum (PC), anterior cingulum (AC), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). ADC and FA of the above areas were related to the scores of certain neuropsychological tests that evaluate visual and verbal memory. No difference in DTI measurements was found between the two MCI subtypes. ADC in MCI cases was increased in comparison with NC in the genu, PC, right SLF, and left AC. FA was spared. Verbal memory was related to ADC of the genu, PC, right AC and right SLF, and to FA of the left SLF. Visual memory was related to ADC of the genu, PC, right AC, and SLF. The strongest correlation found was between the visual memory and the ADC of the right PC (Spearman q  0.45, p  0.001). DTI revealed that ADC was increased in certain brain areas in MCI patients. No difference in DTI measurements was found between the two MCI subtypes. DTI indices correlate with cognitive performance.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is described as a transitional but progressively degenerative phase that precedes the onset of dementia 1. It includes persons who do not fulfill criteria for dementia, but do exhibit some form of cognitive impairment. The syndrome of MCI includes either individuals with impairment in a single cognitive domain or individuals with slight impairment in multiple cognitive domains 2. The most typical and best studied presentation of MCI is the one with only memory deficit: amnestic single domain-MCI (a-MCI). Another type known as multiple domain-MCI (md-MCI) is characterized by mild impairment in more than one cognitive domain such as executive function, language, and visuospatial skills 3. In the case that the md-MCI includes memory impairment, it is called amnestic md-MCI. Nonamnestic MCI refers to the subtype with no memory deficit. In this article, the term a-MCI will be used for the amnestic MCI single domain and the term md-MCI will be used for the amnestic MCI multi domain.\nAccording to pertinent literature, subjects with MCI will progress to dementia within the initial 3 years after diagnosis, at a rate of 10-15  per year 4. In contrast, incidence rate of the conversion to dementia at the general population is only 1-2  per year. The amnestic type of MCI-either single or multi domain-usually progresses to Alzheimers disease (AD), which is the most common type of dementia 5.\nDuring recent years, attention has been drawn to the possible contribution of neuro-imaging modalities in prediction and early diagnosis of dementia. Identification of patients at risk is an important goal because this might allow early therapeutic intervention. Although the classical high resolution MRI images may depict brain atrophy as a generative reason for dementia, they fail to detect the early stages of dementia. However, newly developed structural magnetic resonance (MRI) techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been fruitfully used in studies of MCI as well as AD 6. More specific, DTI method provides two valuable pieces of neuronal fibers structural information by measuring the translational random motion of water molecules within the nerve fibers: the fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects the degree of alignment of cellular structures inside the neuronal fibers as well as the neurons structural integrity and the average diffusion coefficient (ADC), which represents the random mean diffusion of water molecules.\nIn other words, DTI can visualize white matters (WM) microstructures in vivo indirectly by measuring the diffusion of water molecules and distinguishing it from the unrestricted one along the main axis of neurons from the perpendicular one to the main axis of neuronal fibers. Therefore, degenerative neuronal fibers would exhibit a low degree of structural integrity (i.e., low FA values) and a high mean diffusivity (i.e., high ADC values). Based on color maps that represent the orientation of anisotropic tissue, the exact visualization of specific white matter tracts is possible with color-coded maps (ccDTI) technique. The use of colorcoded maps facilitates and presents the results in a more userfriendly way. Using the color-coded maps, FA and ADC can be measured on selected regions of interest (ROIs).\nIn a large series of studies, DTI has been used to detect white matter lesions in MCI patients. According to a recent meta-analysis, patients with MCI when compared with controls have lower values of FA and higher values of ADC in white matter 7. Lesions seem to be pronounced in medial temporal lobe structures, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal association areas. The white matter of the occipital lobes seems to be spared from changes.\nMost of the studies, even the recent ones, have focused on either amnestic MCI or nonamnestic MCI groups 8,9. The nonamnestic MCI though has a higher likelihood of progressing to non-Alzheimer dementias, which are less common than Alzheimer disease. Furthermore, people with the amnestic md-MCI will progress to dementia more rapidly than those having amnestic MCI single domain 10, indicating that amnestic md-MCI is a type of MCI that has to be further investigated. In this study, this group of patients is recognized and compared to normals and a-MCI.\nFurthermore, most studies have insisted on measuring DTI indices providing quantitative rather than qualitative in nature results, not focusing on the relationships between brain regions and domains of cognitive functions. Several studies have explored the relationship of neurodegenerative processes with the results of the neuropsychological tests 111213141516171819202122. As a whole, performance in cognition testing seems to correlate significantly with changes of anisotropy and diffusivity in different regions.\nThe purpose of the present study was to reveal structural abnormalities by the ROI approach in a-MCI single domain and a-MCI multi domain patients compared to normals as well as between the two MCI groups. We further correlated the DTI indices in each area with the results of certain neuropsychological tests in an attempt to clarify the link between the brain lesions and the cognitive dysfunction.",

      "text": "The present study included consecutive patients who consulted from 2006 to 2009 the Memory Clinics of Neurology Departments in Red Cross Hospital and General Hospital of Athens (Greece) for diagnostic evaluation of memory complaints.\nAll participants underwent a wide range of neuropsychological assessments, which included the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the 9-word California verbal learning test, and the modified Rey figure (Table 1). Diagnostic procedures comprised also clinical neurological examination and laboratory tests including vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid hormones. All patients were evaluated with MRI scans. Patients who fulfilled criteria for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson-plus syndromes, familial cases, as well as patients with a history of recent stroke were excluded from the study.\nMCI was determined according to Petersen et al. 23 criteria. To be classified as a-MCI single domain, subjects had to be impaired only in memory. To be classified as a-MCI multi domain, a subject had to be impaired in memory plus another cognitive area. The scores within 1.5 standard deviations below the control mean were used as the cut-off values. Patients with metabolic disease that could be related with cognitive functioning and patients with other brain disease or pathological brain scan findings such as significant cerebrovascular diseases (cortical infarctions, multiple lacunar lesions) were excluded. Any subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, substance abuse, epilepsy, and head trauma were also excluded. Out of the examined subjects during the 3 years of the study, 88 subjects were selected to take part in the study and were further categorized at the below groups: 44 with amnestic MCI single domain (26 females, 18 males; median age 78  8), 19 patients with amnestic MCI multi domain (14 females, 5 males; median age 76  6 years), and 25 who scored within the normal range on all cognitive tests that were used as controls (NCs) (13 females, 12 males; median age 67  9) (Table 2).\nThe MRI measurements were performed on a 1.5-Tesla system (General Electric Signa CVi, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). The parameters of the DTI single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence were: flip angle 90, echo time (TE) 85 ms, repetition time (TR) 10,700 ms, slice thickness 3 mm, spacing between slices 0 mm, field of view (FOV) 26 cm, matrix 128 9 128, and no. of excitations (NEX) 1. The diffusion gradients were applied along 15 non-collinear directions, whose b value was 1,000 s mm -2 . An extra acquisition was performed without diffusion weighting (b  0 s mm -2 ). The scan time for each DTI dataset was approximately 3 min. The coil that was used to transmit the radio-frequency pulses and detect the MRI signal was an eight-element head coil.\nThe processing of the data was performed off-line at a workstation using the Functool software (GE). After determining the lower signal threshold, circular ROIs were placed on the predetermined areas associated with MCI bilaterally, such as posterior cingulum, anterior cingulum, genu, splenium, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Fig. 1). Two independent experienced neuroradiologists manually draw the ROIs using standardized guidelines based on location, color, and size. They completed the ROI analysis on all of the subjects blind to the diagnosis. The reliability of ROI placement, expressed in intra-class correlation coefficients was high (0.8). Identical ROIs for left and right hemisphere were used for each subject (a few mm 2 ). Note that, it is critical to place the ROIs within the actual nerve bundles under investigation without contaminating the measurements by generated signal of adjacent structures. The values of ROIs could represent either FA with values within the range of 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum, i.e., high structural degree) or ADC with values 0 (minimum) to 4 9 10 -9 mm 2 s -1 (maximum, i.e., large mean diffusivity).",

      "text": "Continuous variables were tested for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the whole study group and with the Shapiro-Wilk test for the diagnostic subgroups of the participants. When these variables were normally distributed, they were expressed as mean values (standard deviation). When that was not the case, we reported median values (range). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies andor percentages. Correlations between continuous variables in refer to the whole sample or patient subgroups were performed using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, according to the distribution of the variables to be correlated (normal vs non-normal, respectively). To account for the multiple comparisons testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was used and adjusted p values (with the Benjamini-Hochberg method) were reported. A group comparison of demographic characteristics and neuropsychological tests scores was performed using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Pearson v 2 for categorical variables.\nPost-hoc pairwise analyses were performed using Bonferroni correction. Variables representing MRI measurements (apparent coefficient diffusion values and fractional anisotropy values) for each ROI were compared among the groups of a-MCI, md-MCI, and controls using multiple analysis of covariance (MANOVA) to test whether significant results are attributed to chance due to multiple hypothesis testing or not. In this analysis, we included age as covariate in the model, to take into account its influence on the MRI parameters. Then individual ROIs were further compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for fractional anisotropy and apparent coefficient diffusion values, respectively, across all diagnosis groups and controlling again for age. Once more, for each set of multiple comparisons (apparent coefficient diffusion values and fractional anisotropy values), the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for multiple comparisons correction was used and adjusted p values (with the Benjamini-Hochberg method) were reported. Post-hoc analysis were subsequently performed for the significant results only and corrected again with Bonferroni correction. A similar approach was also used to compare DTI measurements in the patient groups expressing the recognition of REY level (one-way MANOVA with apparent coefficient diffusion and fractional anisotropy values as dependent variables and level of REY recognition as independent variable). The significance level for all tests was set to 0.05.",

It has been suggested that the CC may significantly contribute to the rate of cognitive decline, but its predictive value in MCI is still unclear. In AD and MCI patients, reduction of the FA and increase of ADC in the splenium have turned out to be one of the most common findings 11,27,28. On the other hand, in a few cases no alterations were found in the CC of MCI patients 23,29,33. In the current study, we found that ADC in the genu of all MCI patients was increased when compared with NC. We did not find any alterations in the splenium (S). These results parallel the findings of recent DTI studies 34,35. The genu connects the prefrontal lobes taking part in the Papez pathway. Similarly to the anterior cingulum, the genu is also vulnerable to aging as it also belongs to the frontal lobe. In our study, the diffusivity of the genu of MCI patients remained significantly larger than the controls even when the different age between the two groups was considered as a covariate.",

It plays a role in a variety of functions including attention, decision-making, and problem-solving. The present study indicated that a-MCI patients have higher diffusivity than controls in this area. There are also some previous studies that have found DTI alterations at the frontal lobes of a-MCI subjects 8,24. This finding may be partly explained by the theory of retrogenesis. According to this theory, the sequence of cortical atrophy in AD is the anatomical sequence of brain maturation in reverse 30. Areas with advanced functions, as the prefrontal cortex, mature last and are more vulnerable to degeneration, whereas primary sensorimotor regions are spared until the last stages of AD. White matter degeneration in frontal lobes of AD brains is also detected with neuropathological methods 31. Perhaps, changes in the anterior cingulum reflect early pathological process in the area. The anterior cingulum is found to have a severe age-related abnormality 32 and in our sample, patients are significantly older than normals. One could suppose that the larger ADC of the anterior cingulum in the patients is due to their older age. Nevertheless, we have considered age as a covariate in our statistical model and the results still remained significant.",

    "Superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)": {
      "text": "The major association pathway that links bidirectionally the parietal cortex with the frontal lobe is the SLF. Thus, this pathway provides the frontal cortex with high-order somatosensory input and with information concerning the perception of space. This way the frontal cortex can regulate the focusing of attention and the retrieval of information, playing an important role in memory. In our study, all MCI patients had increased diffusivity in the right SLF compared with controls. There was no difference between the MCI groups for this area. Previous studies have also shown abnormal integrity of SLF in MCI and AD 11,24,27,36.\nIt is obvious that through the several studies, different results have emerged that are often in conflict. During the assessment of results, we have to keep in mind that MCI is not an established cognitive state, but a concept for which different criteria have been proposed. Furthermore, it presents wide variations in natural history. Persons with MCI may progress to dementia, but may also improve 37 implying that the underlying pathologic mechanisms affecting various brain regions is not yet fully identified.",

      "text": "Posterior cingulum (PC)\nThe cingulum bundle-mainly its posterior componentconsists a dorsal limbic pathway which links reciprocally the prefrontal cortex with the hippocampal system. The role of posterior cingulum is critical for memory process. This has been proved by numerous studies that showed metabolic and blood flow alterations in the area, in patients with Alzheimer disease, even in early stages 8,15,16,242526. DTI has often been used for the structural imaging of PC in MCI and AD, as it can detect abnormalities not showed with conventional MRI 11,12,16,24,262728. According to the results of the present study, diffusion of PC in both MCI groups is bilaterally higher than NC. This is consistent with other studies in MCI where increase of diffusion in PC was also detected 8,16,26,29. In contrast to previous studies, FA was spared 16,24,29. This discrepancy may be related to technical limitations as FA is highly sensitive to the orientation of the head, with respect to the fixed geometry of the MRI imaging system gradients 12.",

      "text": "The 9-word California verbal learning test is a sensitive task for estimating episodic memory, more specifically, its verbal comportment. During this task, the patient has to learn a list of nine objects and recall it immediately as well as after 20 min, with and without the use of a category cue. Deficit in delayed cued recall is an early sign of AD 16,27,38. The present study revealed a strong correlation between episodic memory and DTI parameters of PC, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. Even earlier, other studies 15 had showed a significant correlation of the poor performance in delayed recall with the reduction of metabolism in both PC. In our study, both free delayed recall and delayed recall with a category cue were correlated with the ADC of PC, confirming the previous results. What is more an intriguing finding is the strength of the relation between the delayed cued recall and the ADC of right AC (Spearman q  0.35). These last correlations confirm the studies that show that the episodic memory system includes the frontal lobe 39. Rather than being responsible for the retention of information, frontal lobe is involved in its retrieval in the context of an environmental support 40.",

    "Rey figure": {
      "text": "This task mainly assesses the visual memory which is controlled, in general, by the right hemisphere 41. The patient copies a figure which he has later to recall and recognize among four similar ones. According to our results, the recall of Rey was correlated with ADC of both the PC, right AC, both SLF, and the genu. It appears that the left areas of the brain have a role even in visuospatial memory. As for the Rey recognition, it was not correlated with any DTI indices. Although the strongest correlation for all tasks emerged between the ADC of the right PC and the Rey recall (Spearman q  0.45), we did not manage to show any indications of a relationship between visual memory performance and right hemispheric areas. In the same way, we did not find corresponding evidence for the hemispheric localization of the verbal memory which is tested by CVLT. In a similar attempt, Goldstein et al. 20 did not find compelling evidence to support any specific correlation between type of memory and hemispheric localization probably due to the small sample they used.\nThe main conclusions that can be drawn from the present study are the following: first, MCI and normals can be distinguished by DTI WM measures, but a-MCI and md-MCI subgroups cannot be distinguished by these variables. This finding may imply that the two subtypes of MCI share a common pathogenetic mechanism. The pathology of MCI is quite heterogenous including plaque and tangle pathology as well as biochemical and molecular deficits 42. Probably, the difference between a-MCI and md-MCI lies not in the type of pathology, but in its distribution, being broader in the latter. This case is supported by a recent study that also explores the subgroups of MCI 43. In this study of 18 patients with sd-a-MCI and 35 patients with md-a-MCI, the DTI analysis revealed that md-a-MCI patients had reduced FA values in an extensive network comparing to sd-a-MCI. However, in contrast to our work where the number of the examined areas is limited, Haller et al. 43 applied voxelwise TBSS (tract-based spatial statistics), where so many anatomic areas were evaluated. Thus, the role of DTI as an early diagnostic tool of this severe type of MCI has to be further investigated.\nSecond, the frontal lobes are early affected in memory decline, a result not due to aging. Third, diffusivity is a DTI parameter more sensitive to pathological changes than anisotropy. The scores of the tests were mainly correlated with ADC of the ROIs and less with FA. What is more, no significant difference of FA was found between MCI and NC. A similar discrepant behavior of ADC and FA is reported in previous studies 12,14 and was due to technical reasons. Similarly, Sexton et al. 7 at their metaanalysis found heterogeneous results at the comparison of FA due to acquisition parameters and different patients characteristics. FA expresses the preference of the direction of the diffusing water molecules and indirectly gives a measure of the integrity of the white matter architecture; it seems to provide limited information for determining specific brain pathology. On the other hand, ADC can be used as a measure of alteration of brain tissue as it increases in the presence of tissue damage. Interestingly, in the above-described study by Haller et al. 43 only the FA correlated with the clinical diagnosis of MCI subtypes. The authors suggest as an explanation that the changes in MD may appear in more advanced stages of the disease when there is clinically expressed dementia. In order to investigate the behavior of the DTI parameters during the course of the disease, Nowrangi et al. 44 studied anisotropy and diffusivity in three groups (NC, MCI, AD) over 12 months. In this longitudinal study, the diffusivity significantly increased within the MCI group over the study period. This increase did not correspond to any clinical change. Furthermore, no FA changes were found during the follow-up of MCI cases. These results challenge the view that diffusivity is only affected during the late stages. On the contrary, this evidence may suggest that loss of integrity, as measured by DTI, may not yet be pronounced in individuals with MCI.\nOur study had some limitations. The major limitation of the present study was that in comparison with the controls, patients were significantly older. Individuals used as controls were complainers of memory problems who visited the memory clinic, but had no impairment in the neuropsychological assessment. As they were devoid of systematic illnesses or neurologic pathological conditions, we considered them as normal subjects. Furthermore, 20 out of the 25 were re-assessed after 6-8 months and still remained between the normal ranges. To take this difference of age into account, all comparisons were controlled for age. Although the results still remained significant when age was investigated as a potential bias even in areas considered to be affected by aging as the anterior cingulum and the genu, we cannot totally exclude age as a confounding factor in the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, there was no difference in the age between the two subgroups of MCI. Secondly, although the ROIs were placed strategically and were inter-rated by a second examiner, it was not possible to completely exclude white matter hyperintensities. Another technical drawback is the choice of 15 directions instead of 30 that was decided after careful consideration of two things:\nThe difference in quantitative analysis measurements between the 15 and 30 directions was minimal; however, the increased duration of the MRI examination might increase the anxiety of patients and motion artifacts, overall deteriorating the image quality. The duration of 15 directions measurements was approximately half than that of 30 directions. Finally, the small sample size limits the power of the investigation and will require additional studies with larger number of cohorts.\nIn conclusion, DTI can be an indicator of the integrity of brain WM. Using DTI analysis, we found significant microstructural changes of WM tracts in MCI patients-both the single-amnestic and the multi domain types-before the onset of dementia. The strong correlations found between neuropsychological tests and DTI parameters support the concept that WM changes are likely to contribute to cognitive decline and may also have a predictive value.",

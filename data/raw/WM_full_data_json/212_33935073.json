    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Unawareness of disease is a common feature of Alzheimers disease (AD), but few studies explored its neural correlates. Additionally, neural correlates according to the object of awareness are unexplored. Methods: 27 people with AD underwent MRI scanning on a 3T Siemens Prisma. T1-MPRAGE was used to investigate cortical thickness and white matter microstructure was defined by DTI as fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. Preprocessing used FreeSurfer6.0, ExploreDTI, and FSL-TBSS. Awareness of disease, cognitive deficits, emotional state, relationships, and functional capacity were assessed with the short version of the Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia. Voxel-wise correlations between brain structure and awareness were determined by FSL-PALM. Analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement and FWE. Results: Lower left hemisphere cortical thickness was related to poorer disease awareness uncorrected and corrected for age, sex, and MMSE. In the uncorrected model, mainly rightsided, but also left temporal lower cortical thickness was related to decreased awareness of cognitive deficits. Correcting for age, sex, and MMSE eliminated correlations for the right hemisphere, but extensive correlations in the left hemisphere remained. For white matter integrity, higher right hemisphere MD was related to lower cognitive awareness deficits, and lower FA was related to lower functional capacity awareness. Conclusion: Findings suggest that extensive regions of the brain are linked to self-awareness, with particular frontal and temporal alterations leading to unawareness, in agreement with theoretical models indicating executive and mnemonic forms of anosognosia in AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Lack of awareness regarding the disease or its deficits, also called anosognosia, is a common feature of people with Alzheimers disease (AD) 1. It is considered a multifaceted phenomenon, being influenced by neurocognitive 2 and psychosocial factors 3, and ranging from a slight minimization of difficulties to a complete denial of problems 4.\nAnosognosia has been related to different negative consequences for individuals with AD, such as diminished treatment adherence 5, increased engagement in high-risk situations 6,7, earlier institutionalization 8,9, and for their caregivers, such as increased caregiver burden 6,10111213.\nStudies exploring the neuroanatomical correlates of anosognosia in individuals with AD have highlighted associations with various regions: frontal 14,15, temporal, including the hippocampus, 16,17 and also midline structures such as the cingulate cortex 181920. One possible explanation for the discrepancy in results regarding the neural correlates of anosognosia may be the fact that these studies explored awareness in relation to different objects (e.g. cognitive difficulties, emotional changes, behavioral symptoms). In fact, awareness is considered a multidimensional phenomenon 21. It has been shown that patients with AD may present anosognosia for some deficits but preserved awareness of other difficulties 2223242526.\nIn support of these findings, factorial analysis showed that instruments measuring unawareness can be divided into various factors 272829. For example, analyzing the Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia (ASPIDD) 30, Dourado et al. (2014) highlighted a four-factor division: awareness for activities of daily living, awareness of cognitive functioning and health condition, awareness of emotional state, and awareness of social functioning and relationships.\nIn addition, considering that awareness is a broad and multidimensional concept, it might rely not on single-areas of the brain but on the connectivity between different regions. In fact, studies have shown that lack of awareness in patients with AD was related to functional disconnections between cortical midline regions 31, the medial prefrontal cortex and other regions of the prefrontal cortex 32, and between the posterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex 33. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques, which provide information about white matter tracts, some recent studies in patients with schizophrenia highlighted that impaired awareness was also related to diminished structural connectivity 34,35. However, to date, no studies have explored the association between brain structural connectivity, especially using DTI, and awareness in dementia.\nDespite the consensus in the literature regarding the multifaceted characteristic of anosognosia, to our knowledge, no previous studies examined the neural correlates of awareness according to its object. Additionally, DTI has not been used in relation to awareness in AD. Finally, studies on neural correlates of awareness in AD were almost exclusively conducted in developed regions, with more homogeneous educational level.\nAccordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroanatomic substrates of awareness in AD patients using (DTI) in a sample with a heterogeneous educational level.\nThe ASPIDD, used in the current study, allows us to examine the neuroanatomic associations of different objects of awareness. Considering both previous findings regarding neural substrates of anosognosia and the multidimensional nature of awareness, we expected to find an association between awareness and white matter integrity and, additionally, we hypothesized this association to differ according to the object of awareness.",

The clinical diagnosis of AD was made by a psychiatrist using clinical interviews with the patients and caregivers, cognitive screening tests, laboratory tests, and imaging. The participants were diagnosed with possible or probable AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) 36 and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and StrokeAlzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria 37,38. Exclusion criteria were history of other neurological disorder (also excluding cases with mixed AD and vascular dementia); history of head injury resulting in loss of consciousness for more than an hour; history of alcohol or substance abuse (based on ICD-10 criteria); and history of diagnosed major psychiatric illness or current psychological comorbidity (for example, mood disorder).",

      "text": "Cortical thickness was analyzed using FreeSurfer version 6.0 (http:surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). The pipeline has been described extensively before 44,45. In short, T1 images were first linearly registered to Talairach space to compute seed points. Then a correction was applied for bias field inhomogeneity, the skull was stripped and an initial white matter surface was generated using volumetric classification. From Talairach space, cutting planes to separate the hemispheres were obtained. The initial white matter surfaces were nudged into the direction of the gradient to find the white and gray matter and pial surface. Lastly, the cortical surfaces were automatically labeled by nonlinear surfacebased registration of the Desikan-Killiany atlas 46. The resulting surfaces and segmentations were manually checked and corrected if necessary. In 13 patients leftover skull was manually removed and surfaces were recalculated. In 3 patients the white matter was manually corrected and control points were added to recalculate white matter and surface information.\nWhite matter microstructure DTI images were processed using ExploreDTI version 4.8.6 47. First, all images were corrected for signal drift using the b0 smm 2 images as a reference 48, Gibbs ringing artifacts were corrected 49, and if present Venetian Blinds were closed 50. Both DTI and T1 images were then cropped to remove non-brain data, and DTI-images and b-matrix were ordered so that all b0 volumes were at the beginning. Lastly, DTI images were corrected for subject motion and eddy currents, the b-matrix was rotated 51, and images were nonlinearly warped to the participants T1-scan to correct for EPI deformations 52.\nAfter preprocessing every participants fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AxD;  1 ), radial diffusivity (RD; mean  2 and  3 ), and mean diffusivity (MD; mean  1 ,  2 , and  3 ) were extracted. FSLs 6.0.1 Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was used for further analysis (https:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwiki) 53. All FA-images were non-linearly registered to a common space template. Then a mean FA image was created and thinned to create the mean FA skeleton. This skeleton was based on group-specific and represented the center of all tracts common to this group. The subjects-specific FA-image was then projected onto this skeleton and thresholded at FA  0.20. The nonlinear registrations and FA-skeleton were used to warp AxD, RD, and MD images onto the group-specific skeleton.",

This correlation remained after correction for age, sex, and MMSE score (Figure 2).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Awareness of disease was correlated with thinning in extensive regions of the brain, in line with the notion that there is no single awareness center in the brain 57. Nevertheless, there was particular involvement of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, consistent with previous studies (for reviews, 58,59). Findings related to white matter integrity were restricted to a few domains of awareness, with damage to long-distance fibers connecting the cortical regions indicated above.\nBroadly, the relationship between cortical thinning and awareness includes regions related to language processing and monitoring behavior (lateral frontal), insight and awareness (mesial frontal and parietal), and memory (temporal). This may reflect the varied cognitive functions recruited in the generation of self-awareness, including monitoring of responses, evaluation of self-information, and autobiographical recollection, respectively. Left-sided regions correlating with awareness follow, albeit a little more extensive spatially, the patterns of the default mode network (DMN), which is compromised early in the course of AD 60. These findings may be indicative of impaired self-related processing and self-generated thought in this condition 61. Unawareness in AD has been linked to DMN impairment 58 and it has been shown that anosognosia predicts hypometabolism in the DMN in AD 18.\nResults are in line with theoretical models of unawareness, such as the Cognitive Awareness Model (CAM), which suggests a role for both frontal and temporal regions in the etiology of executive and mnemonic forms of unawareness, respectively 2. In executive anosognosia, damage to mechanisms that compare current performance with records of ability prevents proper monitoring of ability. According to the CAM, comparator mechanisms operate both locally, leading to domain-specific unawareness, such as in anosognosia for hemiplegia, and centrally, with a lack of awareness across different abilities. The pattern of results of the current study, with thinning being associated with unawareness of different objects, supports the latter explanation. Additionally, according to the CAM, mnemonic anosognosia occurs when temporal lobe structures are affected, leading both to lack of updating of personal ability and a graded loss of remote memory, what has been termed, metaphorically, a petrified self 62,63.\nSome of the specific regions found to be associated with unawareness in this study have been reported previously, such as middle temporal regions 17, linked to memory function, frontal medial regions (e.g. 64), in particular the anterior cingulate, which has been linked to selfappraisal and error monitoring 65,66, and the insular cortex 19, a region that may be critical for self-awareness in general. There was considerable overlap between these correlates and those found for awareness of cognitive ability, which may suggest either that total scores were driven by scores in the cognitive domain (which provided the largest contribution among domains to the total scores), or that awareness of disease and cognitive ability rely on similar brain networks.\nThe associations were mostly lateralized to the left hemisphere. Although some studies found an association between unawareness and left hemisphere impairment (e.g. 67), the right hemisphere has been more consistently linked to unawareness, both in dementia (e.g. 17,19)\nand in other conditions (e.g. anosognosia for hemiplegia; 68). Considering that the current study is one of the first to investigate neural correlates of awareness in a sample with heterogeneous levels of educational achievement, the use of language-based cognitive resources could be a potential explanation; this is unlikely, however, given that the left hemisphere associations survived adjustments for educational level, unlike right hemisphere correlates. Also, regarding the sample characteristics, the laterality of the participants might be another factor to consider. However, this possibility must be considered carefully, as this information is not disclosed in most of the previous studies, also not being available for the present sample. Another possibility is that this refers to the measure of awareness employed, based on verbal reporting of difficulties, with stronger recruitment of language in response to the awareness questionnaire, as opposed to tasks 19. Nevertheless, right-hemisphere recruitment has been seen across different measures of awareness (e.g. 17; with right medial regions being linked to unawareness measured by questionnaire discrepancies, clinical assessment, or task performance), so it is unlikely this is a complete explanation.\nThere were no white matter correlate for total ASPIDD scores, in keeping with the notion that awareness is a more cortical than subcortical function, relying more heavily on grey than white matter 69. Nevertheless, correlations with long-distance connecting fibers were observed for awareness of cognitive and ADL ability. Notably, these fibers connect frontal regions with parietal and temporal parts, mirroring the cortical findings reported in this study.\nPoorer integrity of the cingulum bundle was associated with unawareness for both domains.\nThis white matter tract connects the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobe sites, being implicated in executive control and episodic memory 70. The findings of the current study are in agreement with previous research that has indicated that disconnection between frontal and temporal regions may be linked to unawareness in dementia 31. The involvement of the forceps minor suggests the importance of connectivity within the frontal lobes, as shown previously 32, reinforcing the notion that integration of information is an essential feature to develop awareness 62.\nThe current study has a few important limitations. In particular, although the assessment of awareness tapped into different objects, the questionnaire relied on patient-informant discrepancy. The questionnaire approach might not accurately reflect the patients awareness, as the responses might be influenced by other factors, such as social-desirability or defensive denial 71. It has also been suggested that informant-based measurements of awareness may be prone to the influence of caregiver burden and depression 72, and these variables were not measured in the current study. Nevertheless, for certain objects of awareness (e.g. mood alterations, functional capacity), that cannot be readily measured by objective testing, questionnaires may be the best alternative. Future research should not only investigate different objects of awareness but rely on complementary methods (e.g. comparison of patient reports with both informant-reports and objective testing) to fully explore the multidimensionality of awareness. Additionally, considering that the focus of the present study was on the neural substrates of anosognosia in relation to the multidimensional nature of awareness, limited cognitive measures were used. Therefore, future studies should include a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Finally, as shown by previous studies 73,74, the reduced sample may have impacted on findings. Nevertheless, this has likely led to less pernicious Type II error, and the sample had a very typical clinical and cognitive profile, not limiting the ability to generalize findings. Also, further studies are necessary in order to replicate these findings.\nIn conclusion, results reinforce the notion that awareness in AD is generated by wide cortical networks, with particular involvement of regions dedicated to memory processing, selfreference, and self-awareness in general. This was accompanied by the involvement of longdistance connecting fibers between these regions in awareness. Stronger involvement of the left hemisphere may be linked to stronger language demands in questionnaire-based measures or reflect heterogeneity in educational level in the sample, suggesting the need for further studies from developing regions. The profile of gray and white matter correlates indicated here, together with previous findings, may allow predictive diagnosis in relation to lack of awareness, improving clinical management of the condition.\nTables Table 1 -",

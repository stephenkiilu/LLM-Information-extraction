However, these studies show inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological variations in delineation of SNc. To mitigate this, our work aims to construct a probabilistic atlas of SNc based on a 3D Neuromelanin Sensitive MRI (NMS-MRI) sequence and demonstrate its applicability to investigate microstructural changes on a large dataset of PD. Using manual segmentation and deformable registration we created a novel SNc atlas in the MNI space using NMS-MRI sequences of 27 healthy controls (HC). We first quantitatively evaluated this atlas and then employed it to investigate the micro-structural abnormalities in SNc using diffusion MRI from 133 patients with PD and 99 HCs. Our results demonstrated significant increase in diffusivity with no changes in anisotropy.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disorder typically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, and these symptoms have been implicated to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). These dopaminergic neurons contain neuromelanin, loss of which manifests as depigmentation of the SNc. This has been well established as an early histological feature of PD (Fearnley  Lees, 1991). Degeneration of these nigral, dopaminergic neurons may lead to alterations in microstructural organization of the regional gray matter, white matter and local myelination of the SNc in PD.\nTo gain understanding of the underlying microstructural changes in the SNc, studies have relied upon anisotropy and diffusivity measures computed from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI or DTI). Typically, these studies initially delineate the SNc and then perform analysis on the computed ROI. Table 1 provides a brief review of existing studies that provides the reported DTI findings in PD and is classified based on the technique used for SNc localization. Majority of these studies (Chan et al., 2007;Du et al., 2011;Knossalla et al., 2018;Langley et al., 2016;Loane et al., 2016;Peran et al., 2010;Rolheiser et al., 2011;Schwarz et al., 2013;Vaillancourt et al., 2009;Zhan et al., 2012) demonstrate a significant difference between PD and HC groups in at least one of the diffusion measures of SNc such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD). Contradictory to these findings, some studies (Aquino et al., 2014;Gattellaro et al., 2009;Menke et al., 2010;Schuff, 2015) report no significant changes in any of these diffusion measures in PD.\nTaken together, the findings have been widely heterogeneous and perhaps could be implicated to inconsistencies in stages of disease severity as well as to variable sample sizes. More importantly, the techniques employed for delineating the SNc may have a significant bearing on the variability in the reported results. For example, studies have employed T2 weighted, proton density weighted spin echo and inversion recovery based contrasts to precisely localize the SNc ROIs (Atasoy et al., 2004;Duguid, De La Paz,  DeGroot, 1986;Geng, Li,  Zee, 2006;Hutchinson  Raff, 2000;Oikawa, Sasaki, Tamakawa, Ehara,  Tohyama, 2002;Pujol, Junque, Vendrell, Grau,  Capdevila, 1992;Stern, Braffman, Skolnick, Hurtig,  Grossman, 1989;Tuite, Mangia,  Michaeli, 2013). However, in a conventional T2 weighted MRI, there is variability in the hypo-intensity associated with the SNc as a result of increased iron deposition, in addition to the reduction in neuromelanin content (Deng, Wang, Yang, Li,  Yu, 2018;Langley et al., 2015;Langley et al., 2016;Wypijewska et al., 2010). This often leads to an inaccurate marking of SNc boundaries and a false pathological representation of dopamine degeneration (Langley et al., 2016). To obtain more precision in SNc delineation, recent studies have relied upon more sophisticated MRI protocols such as DTI where fiber tracking is employed to extract the SNc. (Menke et al., 2010;Sasaki et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2015). However, this technique is highly dependent upon the choice of diffusion MRI protocol and the fiber tracking algorithm as well as is susceptible variations in manual fiber tracking. Nonetheless, direct visualization and segmentation of the SNc, is therefore, a simpler yet a precise option to ensure superior accuracy in analysis of PD. To this end, a novel MR T A B L E 1 Review of articles that have performed diffusion MRI analysis on the substantia nigra pars compacta in Parkinsons disease sequence known as neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NMS-MRI) has demonstrated encouraging results.\nNMS-MRI which is a 3 T T1-weighted high-resolution fast spinecho sequence is highly sensitive to the neuromelanin contained in the SNc and therefore renders the SNc as a hyper intense structure (Sasaki et al., 2006;Sasaki et al., 2008). This sequence is based on the paramagnetic properties of neuromelanin, a neuronal pigment which is a by-product of dopamine synthesis. Owing to the dopaminergic neuron loss in patients with PD, this normally hyper intense structure shows loss of normal signal intensity on NMS-MRI and therefore can be considered as a biomarker for PD. Multiple studies have demonstrated the clinical utility and accuracy of this sequence in patients with PD (Castellanos et al., 2015;Ohtsuka et al., 2013;Ohtsuka et al., 2014;Schwarz et al., 2011). To quantify these differences, the processing techniques that are currently used are based on visual inspection, or manual region of interest drawing followed by computation of volumes, contrast ratios or radiomics features and are arduous and time-consuming (Isaias et al., 2016;Kashihara, Shinya,  Higaki, 2011;Matsuura et al., 2013;Matsuura et al., 2016;Ogisu et al., 2013;Ohtsuka et al., 2014;Reimao et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2006;Schwarz et al., 2011;Shinde et al., 2019). To overcome this, NMS-MRI sequence can be employed to accurately localize and create a template of the SNc that can be utilized for analysis in parkinsonian disorders. Delineating the SNc in healthy controls and creating a template will not only offer better anatomical context to future studies but also provide a normative baseline and a ground-truth for comparison of multiple populations.\nTo this end, our work aims to generate a probabilistic atlas of the (Prasad et al., 2018) of the same group, was used in the construction of our probabilistic atlas.",

      "text": "Probabilistic atlas was built from NMS-MRI images of 27 subjects as shown in Figure 1. For each subject, bilateral substantia nigra ROIs (snROIs) were created from NMS-MRI scans by manual segmentation.\nAn author with expertise in the NMS-MRI sequence (rater1 R1-author SP), delineated the right and left SNc on the axial slices and created a 3D binary mask (snROIs) for all 27 subjects. The NMS-MRI images were then linearly registered to the T1 image of the same subject by performing affine transformation using FLIRT in FSL (Smith et al., 2004).\nThe T1 images of all subjects were preprocessed by performing motion correction, intensity inhomogeneity correction and skull stripping using Freesurfer 6.0 (Fischl, 2012) and were transformed to the MNI space, by employing a deformable registration using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS), wherein a symmetric diffeomorphic transformation model (SyN) was applied and optimized using mutual information. The SyN is a large deformation registration algorithm, which performs a bidirectional diffeomorphism and regularization using Gaussian smoothing of the velocity fields and has shown to outperform other nonlinear registration algorithms in preserving brain topology (Avants, Epstein, Grossman,  Gee, 2008). The transformations from NMS-MRI to T1\nand from T1 to MNI were concatenated and were applied to the snROIs to transform them to MNI space. Along with visual inspection of each registered image, mean and variance of registered images was computed for quality check of registration. A probabilistic atlas of SNc in MNI space was then created, such that the voxel contained in all the 27 snROIs, was labeled with a probability of 1 and voxels not contained in any of the 27 ROIs were labeled with a 0 probability. For all further analysis, the atlas was thresholded at probability of 0.5 in order to largely accommodate all voxel and to avoid over estimation of SNc in the atlas and as shown in Figure 1b. Dice coefficient, a standard measure of validation used in various atlas construction studies (Ariz et al., 2018;Pauli, Nili,  Tyszka, 2018;Visser et al., 2016) was computed to assess inter-rater variability in SNc markings and validity of the constructed atlas. For R3, dice score with other raters and atlas was computed on the testing data with an exclusion of two data points that were outliers. Initially dice coefficient was calculated between the three raters to measure the amount of variability between SNc markings from different raters. To quantitatively validate the atlas, dice coefficient was computed between SNc atlas in subject space and snROIs from all three raters. The template SNc was brought into the subject space using an inverse transformation of the concatenated NMS-MRI to T1 and T1 to MNI deformations. The registration details have been provided in the earlier Section 2.3. To further investigate whether the overlap amongst SNc markings significantly differs from the overlap of atlas and raters markings, we evaluated the statistical significance by testing for the means of dice coefficient scores of raters (R2 and R3) and combined dice scores of atlas with raters R2 and R3 using a Students t test.",

All preprocessing steps were done using FSL5.0.9 (Smith et al., 2004) which included removing the nonbrain regions, correction for head movement and eddy current induced distortions using eddy correct tool that performs an affine transformation between baseline b0 image and gradient images. The resulting rotating parameters of the affine transformation were used to rotate the gradients back, to align them with the transformed images. Least square approximation method was implemented to reconstruct the diffusion tensor images using dtifit, and the tensor fitting was checked for anatomical alignment.\nDiffusion maps such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) were obtained by fitting the diffusion tensor model. FA maps of all subjects were registered to a standard FA map in MNI space-FMRIB58 image (https:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwikiFMRIB58_FA) using SyN algorithm and mutual information similarity index in ANTS. The transformation matrix of this registration was used to transform the MD, RD, and AD maps to MNI space.

In addition, an independent t test was performed between diffusion measures of HC and PD groups. The asymmetric pathological nature of PD is a key feature which aids in differentiating it from atypical parkinsonian disorders. In order to ascertain if this asymmetry is also reflection in diffusion metrics, an independent t test was implemented between DTI measures of left and right SNc for PD patients and separately for HC. All these t-tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates (FDR) threshold of 0.05.\nTo evaluate associations between the microstructural changes to the severity of the disease, the residuals from the diffusion measures after regressing out age and gender were correlated to the UPDRS-III OFF scores (where available), the age of onset of disease (AoO), duration of illness (DoI) and LEDD of patients with PD.",

      "text": "Further, to understand the discriminative power of these diffusion measures, a multivariate random forest (RF) was implemented to delineate PD from the HC. RF is a popular decision tree based machine-learning algorithm (Breiman, 2001). At each node of a tree, different subset of randomly selected predictors are considered, of which the best predictor is selected for further splits. Each tree is built using a different random bootstrap sample, which consists of approximately two-thirds of the total observations. In this study, RF model was implemented on a total dataset of 232 subjects, out of which 75 was used for training and 25 for testing. A total of eight normalized diffusion measures comprising AD, FA, MD, RD for left and right SNc were used as feature set for the classifier.\nNumber of predictors or features sampled for splitting at each node and the number of trees in the forest were the two primary tuning parameters in the model (Liaw  Wiener, 2002). The RF model was tuned on the following parameters-number of trees (between 500 to 1,500), number of samples at each leaf (1 to maximum samples) and number of samples at each split (2 to maximum samples). Gini impurity was used as the criterion for selecting the best split at each node. Features were ranked based on their feature importance.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "We created a probabilistic atlas of the SNc by precisely extracting the SNc ROIs using NM rich MR sequence and employed it to accurately delineate the SNc to create a normative atlas that can be used in future PD studies. We applied this atlas to a large cohort of PD patients to gain understanding of the microstructural abnormalities.\nOur results not only endorsed earlier findings but also facilitated fresh evidence supporting presence of micro-structural changes in PD\nResults of independent t test indicating differences in diffusion measures of bilateral substantia nigra in Parkinsons patient and healthy controls. Blue boxplot indicates healthy controls group whereas orange indicates PD patients group. NS: not significant,  p  .05,  p  .005,  p  .0005 substantia nigra compacta using diffusion MRI analysis. We demonstrated higher diffusivity values in the SNc in PD, with no changes in anisotropy and significant asymmetry of the diffusivity values.\nThe SN is anatomically divided into the SNc and the SN pars reticulata (SNr), where SNc is further subdivided into nigrosomes and the nigral matrix. Nigrosomes are the primary sub regions of the SNc where dopaminergic neurons are degenerated in PD (Blazejewska et al., 2013;Takahashi et al., 2018). The largest of these, nigrosome 1, is positioned in the lateral SN, and is most affected in PD. As described by Takahashi et al, the nigrosome is clearly a part of SNc and hence it is visualized on NMS-MRI sequence. TheT2 weighted images capture the elevated levels of iron mainly in SNr (Du et al., 2011;Langley et al., 2015;Langley et al., 2016;Langley, Huddleston, Sedlacik, Boelmans,  Hu, 2017). A study by Langley et al. demonstrated that T2-weighted and NMS-MRI are sensitive to different sub regions of SN (Langley et al., 2016), and the hypo-intensity observed on T2 images is unreliable in localizing SNc (Deng et al., 2018;Langley et al., 2016;Wypijewska et al., 2010). A recent study also demonstrated that increase in T2 weighted hypo intense signal is an indication of increase in iron deposition related to PD pathology (Langley et al., 2017). On similar lines, work by Visser et al. employed the FLASH sequence on 7 T MRI to delineate the substantia nigra. However, this sequence does not capture the SNc, as it is sensitive only to the elevated concentrations of ferritin that are prominently observed in SNr (Visser et al., 2016). Therefore, applying the SNr atlas to PD is inappropriate in understanding the abnormalities, which occur predominantly in the SNc owing to the dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD.\nTo alleviate these limitations, NMS-MRI has been employed to visualize and quantify the intensity contrast in SNc (Isaias et al., 2016;Matsuura et al., 2013;Matsuura et al., 2016;Ohtsuka et al., 2013;Ohtsuka et al., 2014;Reimao et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2006;Schwarz et al., 2011). Earlier studies on NMS MRI (Kitao et al., 2013;Sasaki et al., 2006), through post mortem analysis, have already demonstrated correlation between localization of SNc region from NMS MRI contrast and the histologically delineated SNc. Additionally, comparative study on SNc contrast sequences has shown that higher concentration of neuromelanin in SNc is captured by NMS-MRI (Langley et al., 2015). Moreover, these studies have corroborated its utility not only to render the SNc region but also as a volume or contrast ratiobased biomarker in PD (Isaias et al., 2016;Kashihara et al., 2011;Matsuura et al., 2013;Matsuura et al., 2016;Ogisu et al., 2013;Ohtsuka et al., 2014;Reimao et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2006;Schwarz et al., 2011). However, the techniques employed to extract and analyze the SNc are manual and time-consuming with low reproducibility.\nOur work alleviated these issues by creating a SNc template which in future studies would be crucial to overcome the discrepancies in SNc localization by providing a normative baseline for comparison of results across studies.\nOur atlas creation was based on uniform and accurate image registration of all subjects to the MNI space. A review study on 14 different T A B L E 3 FDR corrected (p-value  .05) results of independent t test for diffusion measures between healthy controls and patients with Parkinsons disease F I G U R E 4 ROC plots for random forest classifiers nonlinear registration algorithms found that ART and SyN algorithms have consistently performed well across multiple datasets (Klein et al., 2009). We employed a symmetric diffeomorphic (SyN) registration using the ANTs toolbox for registering subject T1 images and subsequently the SNc masks, created from NM rich sequences of 27 subjects onto the MNI space as shown in Figure 1. The maximized optimization of space-time deformation maps in SyN and hierarchical interpolation performed in ANTs, increased normalization accuracy and preserved the brain topology, thus enhancing the registration precision of our probabilistic atlas (Avants et al., 2008;Klein et al., 2009). Each of the registrations was manually checked for precision in registration. The probabilistic atlas created, was thresholded at 50 probability, as it removed the voxels outside the expected SNc region as shown in Figure 1. A consistent dice coefficient score between SNc atlas in subject space and SNc markings by each rater provided a quantitative validation and reproducibility to the atlas.\nOur analysis of diffusion measures was performed on a large cohort of patients with PD where we observed a significantly increased MD, RD and AD in the patients compared to age and gender matched healthy controls (Figure 3), with no significant differences in FA. Earlier studies have reported mixed results for significant differences in FA as shown in Table 1. Study on large cohorts by Schuff et al and a few others did not report significant changes in FA (Aquino et al., 2014;Gattellaro et al., 2009;Menke et al., 2010). Our results corroborate these findings, albeit on a completely different dataset. The significant changes were obtained only in the diffusivity measures (MD, RD, AD) as shown in Figure 2b) and were also reflected in the classifier results where the left MD and RD and right RD were captured as the most discriminative features of PD with an accuracy of 71.7 (RF-RFE).\nDegree of myelination, axonal diameter and distance between extracellular membranes drive the changes in radial diffusivity, whereas diffusion anisotropy implies a directional alignment of white matter tracts (Beaulieu, 2002). Intuitively, the biological process of fiber disintegration and de-myelination which are associated with neurodegeneration, should lead to an increase in RD and reduction in FA values. However, neurodegeneration may involve multiple additional pathological processes such as changes in membrane permeability, restructuring of white matter fibers, glial alterations and damage to the intracellular compartment. The degree of variation in these processes may be contributing towards the proportional changes in diffusion tensors in all three dimensions, and thereby reducing the sensitivity of FA (Acosta-Cabronero, Williams, Pengas,  Nestor, 2010). Nevertheless, it is important to note that our diffusion protocol was limited to 15 gradient directions which may not facilitate the best model (Jones, Knosche,  Turner, 2013) for fiber tractography or connectivity, but is valid for computing diffusivity and anisotropy measures.\nIn concurrence with the clinical asymmetry typically reported in PD, which is implicated to an asymmetrical degeneration of dopaminergic nigral neurons, we observed significant asymmetry of diffusion measures in SNc. Although the FA was not significantly different between PD and controls, in patients with PD, we observed that the FA in left SNc was significantly lower when compared to the FA in right SNc (Figure 3). Similarly, MD, AD and RD also demonstrated significantly higher values in the left SNc when compared to right (Figure 3). We did not have details pertaining to clinical laterality, owing to which we were unable to ascertain the concordance between clinical lateralization and diffusion asymmetry. However, earlier work by our group has illustrated the correlation of clinical asymmetry and laterality with the asymmetry of the SNc using contrast ratios on NMS-MRI (Prasad, Saini, Yadav,  Pal, 2018).\nOur correlation analysis did not demonstrate any significant associations of DTI measures with AoO, DoI, UPDRS-III OFF, or LEDD scores. However, a trend was observed between UPDRS, and FA, DoI and FA, MD, RD and between AoI and FA (Supplementary Figure S1).",

Microstructural abnormalities of the SNc in PD are predominantly associated with altered diffusion metrics rather than anisotropy, and demonstrate a significant asymmetry which is in concurrence with clinical lateralization of symptoms. These results obtained from our large-scale study on an accurately delineated SNc provide a thorough and reliable profile of the neurodegeneration associated microstructural abnormalities of the SNc in PD.",

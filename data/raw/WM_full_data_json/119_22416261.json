    "abstract": "Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows examination of the microstructural integrity of white matter in the brain. Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease, and DTI can provide indirect insights of the microstructural characteristics of brains in individuals with different forms of dementia. Purpose: To evaluate the value of DTI in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). Material and Methods: The study included 40 patients (20 AD patients and 20 SIVD patients) and 20 normal controls (NC). After routine MRI and DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured and compared in regions of interest (ROI). Results: Compared to NC and AD patients, SIVD patients had lower FA values and higher ADC values in the inferior-fronto-occipital fascicles (IFOF), genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Compared to controls and SIVD patients, AD patients had lower FA values in the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, IFOF, GCC, and CF; and higher ADC values in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. Conclusion: DTI can be used to estimate the white matter impairment in dementia patients. There were significant regional reductions of FA values and heightened ADC values in multiple regions in SIVD patients compared to AD patients. When compared with conventional MRI, DTI may provide a more objective method for the differential diagnosis of SIVD and AD disease patients who have only mild white matter alterations on T2-weighted imaging.",

      "text": "In principle, the definitive diagnosis of dementia depends on an autopsy (1). The clinical diagnosis of dementia is based on symptoms, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging studies. Among these strategies, neuroimaging studies play an important role in the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the various types of dementia.\nConsiderable overlaps exist between Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia in areas such as clinical features, pathological lesions, and the associated risk factors (2). Vascular dementia, the second most common cause of dementia, encompasses a heterogeneous group of cognitive impairments caused by various cerebrovascular lesions. SIVD is a subtype of vascular dementia where abnormalities are found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subcortical white matter regions (3). The proportion of SIVD among vascular dementias ranges from 36 to 67. (4). The cognitive symptoms in patients with SIVD are characterized by dysexecutive syndrome with slowing of mental processing and relatively mild memory deficits (5,6).\nPatients with vascular dementia typically show high signal intensities in the periventricular or subcortical regions on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Furthermore, periventricular high signal intensity on T2WI is frequently observed in normal elderly subjects and AD, which makes it difficult to differentiate AD from vascular dementia by conventional MR imaging.\nThe aim of this study was to identify the distribution of microstructural alterations in the white matter in patients with different types of dementia with the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and to evaluate the value of DTI in the differential diagnosis of SIVD and AD patients who have only mild white matter alterations on T2WI.\nDTI is a type of functional MR imaging that enables the examination of the microstructural integrity of white matter in vivo (7 -10). This emerging technique combines MR diffusion weighted pulse sequences with tensor mathematics to measure molecular diffusion in three dimensions. Two complementary parameters obtained from DTI measurements are the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), which are known to be influenced by changes in the tissue microenvironment, and the provision of quantitative measures of directionally averaged diffusion. DTI is even able to outline the white matter architecture and reveal structures that are usually hidden on conventional MRI scans. DTI studies have shown that microscopic white matter changes exist in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which are not detected by conventional MRI (11)(12)(13).\nAlthough DTI has been mainly used to investigate regional white matter changes, it is still not clear whether it can also be adopted to study microstructural alterations of subcortical white matter of SIVD. The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of microstructural changes in white matter in patients with different dementias using DTI, and whether DTI may be a more objective method for differentiating between SIVD and AD. Aside from the exclusion criteria mentioned by Di Paola (7), some other criteria are as follows: (a) patients who could not comply with the recognition tests; and (b) patients with metal implants that contraindicated the use of MR imaging. To make the groups comparable for DTI, those patients with AD who had no white matter alterations and those patients with vascular dementia who had severe white matter alterations on T2WI were excluded. These criteria were based on a modification of those for subcortical vascular dementia described by Erkinjuntti et al. (15). Finally, 20 healthy normal control (NC) elderly individuals were recruited from the same geographical area, and were rigorously matched with the patient groups for age and gender.",

      "text": "The participants demographic and clinical information is listed in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to variables such as age, gender, and level of education. However, the groups differed significantly on their MMSE and MoCA scores. Pairwise comparisons indicated that SIVD and AD patients had significantly lower MMSE scores and MoCA scores than NC participants.\nAll participants underwent the same imaging protocol, which included whole-brain T1-weighted, diffusionweighted scanning, and standard clinical sequences value of 0 and 800 smm 2 , respectively. To increase signal-to-noise ratio, scanning was repeated three times (total time ¼ 4 min 13 s).\nThe postprocessing Fiber Trak software was used to measure FA and ADC values in different layers of B0 map and color-coded map on the axial images in three groups. We placed 10 rectangular ROIs (size ranged from 30 to 40 mm 2 , containing 6 -10 pixels) in subcortical regions (Fig. 1) that included the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, hippocampus, and various association tracts (Fig. 2). These latter included the inferior-fronto-occipital fascicles (IFOF), genu, and splenium of the corpus callosum (GCC, SCC), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and the cingulate fasciculus (CF). The non-midline regions were measured on both sides. An experienced neuroradiologist, blinded to the diagnosis, performed the placements of the ROI for FA and ADC. Each ROI was controlled under two voxels in all tracts.\nData were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, Version 15.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses were performed on FA and ADC values by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed up with post hoc LSD (least significant difference) tests for multiple comparisons. For all the analyses, statistical significance was accepted at P , 0.05.",

      "text": "Making the differential diagnosis may be difficult in patients with SIVD or AD who show only mild signal Fig. 1 The ROIs B0 image (A1 -C1) and color-coded map (A2 -C2) in the white matter of the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe and hippocampus in the SIVD group intensity alterations in the white matter on T2WI. Thus, in the present study, we used sophisticated image processing algorithms to identify and compare the regional pattern of FA changes between patients with different types of dementia and normal controls. Distinct patterns of white matter abnormalities were found in the patients in each of the three groups. Compared to elderly individuals with normal cognitive function, SIVD patients had diffusion tensor changes in both the anterior and posterior cerebral white matter, including the IFOF, GCC, SCC, and SLF. Multiple lesions in the corpus callosum can cause memory impairment and personality changes. Furthermore, the abnormal integrity of the SLF can cause impairments in spatial attention and spatial working memory.\nThe subcortical thalamic-basal-prefrontal circuits are particularly important as dysfunction in these might result in the main cognitive, behavioral, and clinical neurological features of SIVD ( 4). An attractive hypothesis to explain cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral small vessel disease is that white matter tract damage results in a disconnection syndrome, owing to the interruption of large tracts of cerebral nerve fibers. Our results, in line with previous hypotheses, provide additional evidence that damage to white matter projections is an important mechanism of cognitive impairment, and they are consistent with the disconnection hypothesis of cognitive impairment in patients with small vessel disease.\nThe results of our study show that SIVD patients have significantly different average ADC values and average FA histograms of the brain compared with control groups. These findings are consistent with the results of other studies (3, 11). Sugihara et al. reported that FA values of the anterior white matter tended to be lower than those of the posterior white matter in patients with vascular dementia (18). The discrepancy between this finding and our own might be due to differences in the study group selection, and the fact that different diagnosis criteria were adopted. However, the multiple diffusion tensor changes were specific for SIVD, which highlighted its clinical and neuropsychological features, characterized by extensive arteriole occlusions and micro-atherosclerosis, which can cause multiple lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions, extensive demyelination, and axonal loss. Beyond the findings from traditional imaging and neuropsychological testing, DTI can serve as a sensitive technique for early detection of cognitive decline in SIVD patients.\nOur DTI study has also provided evidence of white matter anisotropy decline in the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, IFOF, GCC, and CF in AD patients, which correlates with the results of previous studies (3,10,11,13,19). Reduced FA values in the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe and hippocampus in AD patients indicates a net loss of barriers that normally restrict the movement of water molecules and can be explained by temporal-frontal disconnections (13). Increased ADC values in the temporal lobe, and hippocampus in AD group were also observed. This may have been the result of a decreased number of neurons and a consequently enlarged tissue space. In particular, although the precise neural correlates of altered diffusivity measurements have not been previously described with respect to neurodegeneration, increased ADC values most likely result from the loss of neurons, axons, and dendrites, which is thought to produce an increased extracellular space and elevated water diffusivity within these regions (8). It has been suggested that the pathological processes of AD begin in medial temporal structures (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus), advance to the temporal cortex, and then affect posterior parietal lobes, and finally the different levels of frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex. Our results are consistent with this paradigm.\nIn order to eliminate subjective errors, an experienced neuroradiologist, who was blinded to the clinical diagnosis of participants, placed the ROIs following strict criteria. However, our study had several limitations. First, we used anisotropic voxels for the DTI, and this might have biased the FA calculation. A histogram-based approach or a voxelbased statistical approach can be used to reduce some of the problems of ROI analysis. Second, the SIVD patients with severe T2 hyperintensities were excluded from in this study. This may have generated some bias for the results. However, the aim of this study was to evaluate the value of DTI in making the diagnosis of dementias and differentiating between SIVD and AD. In order to eliminate the influence of the subjective, patients with similar T2 hyperintensities were enrolled. Finally, our study was limited by the relatively small number of enrolled patients. Future studies should adopt larger sample sizes for groups of patients.\nIn conclusion, there were significant regional reductions of FA values and heightened ADC values in multiple neural regions in SIVD patients compared to AD patients. DTI may thus provide a more objective method for the differential diagnosis of SIVD and AD.",

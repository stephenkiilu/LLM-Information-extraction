    "abstract": "This study used diffusion tensor imaging tractography at 3 T MRI to relate cognitive function to white matter tracts in the brain. Brain T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery-weighted and diffusion tensor 3 T MRI scans were acquired in thirty-three healthy participants without mild cognitive impairment or dementia. They completed a battery of neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Stroop test, Trail Making Test B, Wechsler Memory Scale-III Longest span forward, Wechsler Memory Scale-III Longest span backward, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test Version II Long Delay Free Recall, and Letter Number Sequencing. Tractography was generated by the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking method. The corpus callosum, cingulum, long association fibers, corticospinal bulbar tracts, thalamic projection fibers, superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle and inferior cerebellar peduncle were manually segmented. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of these tracts were quantified. We studied the association between cognitive test scores and the MD and FA of tracts while controlling for age and total white matter hyperintensities volume. Worse scores on the Stroop test was associated with decreased FA of the corpus callosum, corticospinalbulbar tract, and thalamic projection tracts. Scores on the other cognitive tests were not associated with either the FA or MD of measured tracts. In healthy persons the Stroop test appears to be a better predictor of the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts measured by DTI tractography than other cognitive tests.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cognitive function is thought to relate to specific brain structures (Sporns 2013). The exact associations are still unclear (Bennett and Madden 2014). Most studies have used noninvasive imaging of the brain such as diffusion tensor imaging tractography to clarify structure-function relationships (reviewed in Bennett and Madden 2014;Madden et al. 2012). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assesses the integrity of white mater by measuring the diffusion of water molecules using MRI (Le Bihan, 2003). Tractography is an application of DTI that attempts to visualize all the fiber tracts in the brain (Johansen-Berg and Behrens 2006). Tractography reconstructs fiber tracts in three-dimensional spaces by following the path of restricted water diffusion along myelinated axons. In quantitative tractography the integrity of these tracts is described with its mean diffusivity (MD, the degree of water diffusion) and fractional anisotropy (FA, the directionality of the diffusion). Pathological processes that disrupt the integrity of white matter tracts usually lead to increased MD and decreased FA. There have been several tractography studies attempting to relate the FA and MD of white matter tracts to performance on specific tests of cognitive function (Sullivan et al. 2006;Voineskos et al. 2012;Wolf et al. 2014;Jacobs et al. 2013;Sasson et al. 2012;Sasson et al. 2013;Nazeri et al. 2015;Kortte et al. 2002;Zahr et al. 2009;Bendlin et al. 2010;Perry et al. 2009;Booth et al. 2013;Charlton et al. 2010;Bosch et al. 2012;Metzler-Baddeley et al. 2011;Ystad et al. 2011;Gao et al. 2014;Sasson et al. 2012;Madden et al. 2004, Sullivan et al. 2010a, b;Bucur et al. 2008;Bennett et al. 2012;Bennett et al. 2011;Davis et al. 2012;Antonenko et al. 2012;Borghesani et al. 2013;Brickman et al. 2012;Coxon et al. 2012;Lockhart et al. 2012;Salami et al., 2012;Samanez-Larkin et al., 2012).\nFew clear associations between fiber tracts and cognitive tests have been described. This may in part relate to differences in cognitive testing across tractography studies. There are a variety of cognitive tests that have been used in tractography studies. Further complicating matters is that some studies have compared fiber tracts to performance on individual tests while other studies have compared fiber tracts to performance on a combination of cognitive tests thought to represent a cognitive domain such as memory, executive function or processing speed. On review of the literature, performance on the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) either as an individual test or as part of combination of tests has been associated with the FA and MD of the corpus callosum (Sullivan et al., 2006;Voineskos et al., 2012;Wolf et al., 2014). FA of the corona radiata (Wolf et al., 2014;Jacobs et al., 2013). superior longitudinal fasciculus (Jacobs et al., 2013;Sasson et al., 2012;Sasson et al., 2013). anterior limb of the internal capsule (Wolf et al., 2014) and superficial white matter (Nazeri et al., 2015). The Trail Making Test B (Kortte et al., 2002) has been associated with no tracts (Zahr et al., 2009) or the FA of the corona radiata (Bendlin et al., 2010). inferior longitudinal fasiculus (Perry et al., 2009) and superficial white matter (Nazeri et al., 2015). Letter Number Sequencing (Wechsler, 1997) has been associated with the FA of thalamic projection fibers (Booth et al., 2013;Charlton et al., 2010). corpus callosum (Voineskos et al., 2012;Charlton et al., 2010). uncinate fasiculus (Charlton et al., 2010) and superficial white matter (Nazeri et al., 2015). Wechsler Memory Scale-III Longest span forward (Wechsler, 1997) has been associated with no tracts (Voineskos et al., 2012;Zahr et al., 2009;Bosch et al., 2012) or with the FA of thalamic projection fibers (Booth et al., 2013) or the uncinate fasiculus (Booth et al., 2013). Wechsler Memory Scale-III Longest span backward (Wechsler, 1997) has been associated with no tracts (Zahr et al., 2009) or the FA of cingulum (Charlton et al., 2010;Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2011), thalamic projection fibers (Booth et al., 2013;Charlton et al., 2010) and uncinate fasiculus (Booth et al., 2013;Charlton et al., 2010). California Verbal Learning Test Version II Long Delay Free Recall (Delis et al. 2000) has been associated with no tracts (Ystad et al., 2011). The remaining tractography studies characterized other cognitive tests (Gao et al., 2014;Sasson et al., 2012;Madden et al., 2004, Sullivan et al., 2010a, b;Bucur et al., 2008;Bennett et al., 2012;Bennett et al., 2011;Davis et al. 2012;Antonenko et al., 2012;Borghesani et al., 2013;Brickman et al., 2012;Coxon et al., 2012;Lockhart et al. 2012;Salami et al. 2012;Samanez-Larkin et al. 2012). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al. 2005) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (Mattis, 1976) have not been correlated with tractography.\nAdditional tractography studies are needed to confirm earlier reported associations and to assess for any associations with the MoCA, a popular screening test of global cognitive function. Age and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are known to be important contributors to cognitive function in healthy persons (Bennett and Madden, 2014;Madden et al., 2012;Debette and Markus 2010) Version II Long Delay Free Recall were included because they were previously compared to the diffusion characteristics of white matter tracts as described above. The MoCA and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale were included because they are popular clinical tests of global cognitive function that have yet to be compared to the diffusion characteristics of white matter tracts.",

      "text": "Image analysis was completed blind to participants data. Diffusion-weighted images were corrected for eddy current distortions using FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox in FMRIB Software Library (www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl, FSL (Smith et al. 2010)). DTI reconstruction of the pre-processed data from FSL was completed with Diffusion Toolkit 0.5 (Ruopeng Wang, Van J. Wedeen, Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, www.trackvis.org). The output included diffusion tensor data and parametric diffusion-weighted image, FA and MD maps. Tracts were assigned in Diffusion Toolkit by the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) method (Wiegell et al. 2000). The subjects T2 FLAIR MRI was registered by the affine method (12 degrees of freedom) to the diffusion-weighted image map with Slicer 3D 4.1(www.slicer.org) (Example in Fig. 2). Tractography data and co-registered T2 FLAIR were analyzed with TrackVis (www.trackvis.org). WMH lesions were manually segmented by a single rater (WR) with the same method used in an earlier study (Reginold et al. 2015). Although there is high intra-rater and inter-rater variability, expert manual segmentation of WMH is considered the gold standard for measuring WMH in studies of WMH segmentation (Simoes et al. 2013). All WMH lesions on axial T2 FLAIR were manually segmented. The boundaries of individual WMH were clarified with windowing of axial T2 FLAIR slices. Individual WMH lesions were outlined slice-by-slice on all forty axial T2 FLAIR slices for each patient with a mouse-controlled interface on TrackVis. The software generated a single ROI that included all voxels within outlined areas. The total number of voxels in the whole brain that were within WMH were measured. Intracranial volume was calculated with volBrain software (Manjón and Coupé 2015). WMH volume was measured as the number of WMH voxels divided by intracranial volume (voxelscm3). Similarly, ROIs were placed within tracts of interest using axial and sagittal colour FA maps and T2 FLAIR. Tracts-of-interest were segmented by selecting tracts crossing through the ROIs. Segmented tracts included the corpus callosum, cingulum, long association fibers, corticospinalbulbar tracts, thalamic projection fibers, superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Examples of the segmented tracts and image registration are shown in Figs. 1 and2.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our results support earlier tractography structure-function studies in their conclusion that one region-one task dissociations are rare. The Stroop test was unique in its association with the corpus callosum, corticospinalbulbar tract and thalamic projection tracts. The association we detected between the Stroop test score and white matter tracts is consistent with seven earlier tractography studies of healthy persons (Sullivan et al., 2006;Voineskos et al., 2012;Wolf et al., 2014;Jacobs et al., 2013;Sasson et al., 2012;Sasson et al., 2013;Nazeri et al., 2015). This demonstrates that there is a reproducible association between performance on the Stroop test and white matter tract integrity. Functional brain imaging studies have found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior parietal cortex may be involved in the Stroop task (Zoccatelli et al. 2010). The corpus callosum and parts of the corticospinalbulbar tracts (internal capsule) connect the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Wolf et al., 2014).\nThe thalamic projection tracts connect to the anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior parietal cortex (Wolf et al., 2014) For the Trail Making Test B, Longest Span Forward and Longest Span Backward there have been earlier conflicting reports with some studies suggesting associations with white matter tracts (Nazeri et al., 2015;Bendlin et al., 2010;Perry et al., 2009;Booth et al., 2013;Charlton et al., 2010;Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2011) and other detecting no associations (Voineskos et al., 2012;Zahr et al., 2009;Bosch et al., 2012). In this study we were unable to detect any associations between these tests and the integrity of white matter tracts. Consistent with one earlier study of Long Delay Free Recall, we were unable to detect any association with white matter tracts (Ystad et al., 2011). Unlike four earlier studies of Letter Number Sequencing, we were unable to detect any associations with white matter tracts (Voineskos et al., 2012;Nazeri et al., 2015;Booth et al., 2013;Charlton et al., 2010). There was a trend for lower scores on Letter Number Sequencing to be associated with increased MD of thalamic projection fibers but it was not statistically significant (p  0.05). This is the first report of analysis of the MoCA and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, and they have been found to not have any association with white matter tracts in healthy persons, which is somehow surprising giving the extent of cognitive domains investigated with these tests. Lower MoCA scores have been associated with increased MD and decreased FA in patients with Alzheimers dementia, Parkinsons disease or cerebrovascular disease (Bennett and Madden, 2014;Chen et al. 2015;Cooley et al. 2015;Guo et al. 2014;Meng et al. 2012) but have not been investigated in cognitively normal populations. The association between the MoCA scores and white matter tract integrity may be specific to disease states.\nAs expected, across the cognitive tests, age was the best predictor of performance on the tests for healthy persons. As there were no correlations between WMH volume and cognitive function, the integrity of white matter tracts measured by DTI has a better correlation of cognitive function in healthy persons than WMH volume. WMH volume did not predict performance on any of the other tests after controlling for the effects of age and white matter integrity. DTI measures are likely more sensitive to white matter changes than WMH volume. WMH lesions with identical high signal appearance on T2 weighted MRI could differ substantially from mild to marked demyelination, axonal loss and astrogliosis (Gouw et al. 2011). The strength of FA and MD of white matter is that it can measure the spectrum of injury within WMH lesions and also can detect changes in white matter that appears normal on T2 weighted MRI (Gouw et al., 2011).\nThis study demonstrates the utility of quantitative tractography in clarifying structure-function relationships between white matter tracts and cognitive function. In healthy persons the Stroop test appears to be a better predictor of the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts measured by DTI than the MoCA. This is likely the result of the multiple areas involved in the Stroop task.\nCompliance with ethical standards All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.\nConflict of interest William Reginold, Justine Itorralba, Angela Tam, Angela Luedke, Juan Fernandez-Ruiz, Jennifer Reginold, Omar Islam, and Angeles Garcia declare that they have no conflict of interest.",

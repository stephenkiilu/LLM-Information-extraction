      "text": "Cognitive decline in Down syndrome (DS) generally shows neurodegenerative aspects similar to what is observed in Alzheimers disease 1,2. Similarly, from the clinical point of view, the cognitive decline in DS results in a dementia syndrome characterized by apraxia and agnosia, change in personality, behavior, and deficit in communication similar to Alzheimers disease 1,3,4. The hypothesis that DS is phenotypically similar to Alzheimers disease has been validated by several post-mortem studies 3,5. These studies have shown that, by 40 years of age, all individuals with DS are subjected to neuropathological changes consistent with Alzheimers disease, including senile (i.e. amyloid) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\nNeuroimaging have an increasing role in understanding the pathogenesis of dementia including DS 6. Most magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies focused their attention to the changes occurring in the cortex of DS subjects with or without cognitive decline 789101112 and only few reported information on white matter integrity 13,14. Among MRI techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) represents a non-invasive in vivo method to evaluate white matter integrity 15. DTI samples tissue microstructure by the measure of water diffusion pattern as influenced by the microscopic architecture of surrounding tissues. Parameters derived from diffusion tensor such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivity (AD and RD) can assess brain microstructural damages indicating disruption of its integrity from loss of compactness, myelination, andor loss of axons within the studied tract. It has been demonstrated that anisotropy changes correlate with cognitive declinechanges and may help monitoring normal development and aging as well 16. The loss of white matter integrity, in both normal aging and Alzheimers disease, is a wellknown process 1718192021, while little is known concerning DS. Teipel et al. 13 evaluated the involvement of corpus callosum and correlated its atrophy to cognitive decline, in subjects with DS. These authors suggested that the loss of axonal projection from posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital association cortical areas, observed in DS subjects, could be related to cognitive performance, as well as performance in orientation, language, and visuo-spatial tests. Although the corpus callosum atrophy has been demonstrated, the involvement of axonal projection remains a hypothesis. More recently, Powell et al. 22 reported white matter changes, in the frontal lobes of DS subjects, which correlate with the development of cognitive decline. On the other hand, Fenoll et al. 14, using DTI, reported that white matter changes were not accelerated in non-demented DS subjects compared to normal aging subjects. These authors speculated that DTI technique is not able to detect pre-dementia structural damages which would become evident only in the latest phases.\nThe limited number of reports on this topic, as well as the heterogeneity of findings, suggest that further evaluations on white matter integrity by means of DTI should be performed in DS. Indeed, DTI findings may help to confirm the relationship between white matter integrity and dementia in these subjects, being a potential early biomarker of neurodegeneration, before the clinical symptoms are evident.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate white matter alterations in a cohort of young Down subjects, without dementia, by means of DTI technique, compared to a normal control group, in order to verify previously reported findings 13 and, in particular, define whether these changes are present in asymptomatic subjects.",

      "text": "The study group consisted of 26 right-handed subjects with DS (16 males and 10 females; mean age  SD  24.82  7.63 years; range 14-27 years), studied between June 2012 and May 2014. All DS subjects were enrolled in this study by our pediatricians and were recruited from the community. The inclusion criterion was the diagnosis of DS confirmed by karyotype examination showing trisomy of chromosome 21. Exclusion criteria were the presence of dementia (assessed by the Dementia Scale for Down Syndrome (DSDS) 23 and the Dementia Questionnaire for Mentally Retarded Persons (DMR) 24 and the presence of untreated medical conditions that might have affected cognition, such as vascular and tumoral lesions, or any history of severe head trauma requiring medical attention.\nA control group of 17 healthy volunteers were recruited, matched for both sex and age (mean age  SD  26.1  5.0 years; range 14-27 yrs). For the control group, exclusion criteria were the presence of untreated medical conditions that might have affected cognition, such as vascular and tumoral lesions, or any history of severe head trauma requiring medical attention.\nParents of both adult (over 18 years) and children (under 18 years) participants, and control subjects were informed about the study protocol, and written consent was obtained. The study had the institutional review board approval.",

      "text": "All individuals participating in this study were examined using a Siemens (Siemens, Enlargen, Germany) Magnetom AERA scanner (1.5 T), equipped with a 16-channel phasedarray head coil.\nThe imaging protocol included a T2-weighted, FLAIR, sequence (TRTE  900086 ms; flip angle  150; matrix  320  210; resolution  0.8  0.8  5 mm 3 ; scan time 3 min) in order to discard any cerebral disease, and a high-resolution 3D T1 weighted sequence (TRTE  24003.99 ms; flip angle  8; matrix  192  192; resolution: 1.2  1.2  1.2 mm 3 ; scan time 5 min and 20 s) as anatomical reference.\nDTI data acquisition was performed applying diffusion sensitizing gradients with b  1000 smm 2 along 32 noncoplanar directions; one additional scan without diffusion weighting (b  0 smm 2 ) was also acquired. DTI images were acquired by means of a SE single-shot EPI sequence (TR TE  450083 ms; flip angle  90; matrix  128  128; resolution: 2  2  5 mm 3 ; scan time 15 min).\nImage quality and the absence of structural abnormalities and artifacts were verified by two examiners (R.C., A.P.), who were unaware of each others findings. In cases of inter-observer disagreement, a final consensus was achieved after discussion.",

    "Data preprocessing and analysis": {
      "text": "Image processing and analysis were performed using FMRIB Software Library (FSL version 4.1.9, http:www.fmrib.ox.ac. ukfsl)) software package.\nFirst, for each subject, the b 0 image (the one without diffusion weight) was skull-stripped using the brain extraction tool (BET). Then, data were corrected for subject motion (affine transformation to the b 0 image) and eddy current-induced geometrical distortions (non-linear b-spline to the b 0 image). The diffusion sensitizing gradients were rotated to correct for motion. Finally, the diffusion tensor was estimated voxel by voxel and the FA, MD, AD, and RD maps derived from the tensor.\nTBSS (tracted based spatial statistic) was used to perform the voxel-wise analysis for all derived parameters. This fully automated whole-brain analysis technique involves voxelwise statistics on diffusion metrics, simultaneously minimizing the effects of misalignment by using the conventional voxel-based analysis method 25,26. Briefly, the FA maps of all subjects were aligned to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and averaged to create a mean FA common target image. Successively, the mean FA was thinned to create a mean FA skeleton, using a FA threshold of 0.2 in order to exclude non-WM voxels. The non-linear warps and skeleton projection were then applied to all derived maps. Thus, the FA, MD, AD, and RD maps of each subject were separately projected onto the mean FA skeleton resulting in an alignment-invariant representation of the central trajectory of white matter pathways.\nFor each parameter, voxel-wise statistical analysis was performed via a permutation-based inference for non-parametric statistical thresholding using FSLs randomize 27. Number of permutations was set to 5000, to allow robust statistical inference, and threshold-free cluster enhancement was employed to avoid the use of an arbitrary threshold in the initial cluster formation. All randomize analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons; sex and age were treated as confounding covariates.\nFinally, for each parameter, a two-sample, two-tailed t test was performed to assess differences between DS and controls subjects. For between-group comparisons, a family-wise error corrected threshold of P  0.05 was selected.",

All DS subjects were non-demented (DSDS score  3; DMR: mild to moderate level of intellectual disability).\nNone of participants were discarded from the analysis due to the presence of any cerebral pathological condition assessed by FLAIR imaging. Nine DS subjects were ultimately excluded, based on images quality (movement artifacts). Thus, the final sample included 17 DS subjects (9 males and 8 females; mean age  SD  23.7  5.78 years; range 15-27 years) and seventeen control subjects.\nIn Fig. 1, maps of significant (p  0.05, FWE corrected) difference in FA, MD, AD, and RD between DS and controls were reported. In particular, a FA decrease and a MD, AD, and RD increase, in DS subjects compared to control subjects, were present in the region of the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculum (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculum (ILF), and the cortico-spinal tract (CST), bilaterally (Table 1).\nAs reported in Table 1, other white matter structures (minor and major forceps, the superior longitudinal fasciculum (SLF), the cingulum, and the uncinate fasciculum) were involved by changes of tensor parameters (MD, AD, RD).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "All DS individuals, by the 4th decade, show the presence of tangles and plaques, with a neuropathological picture similar to Alzheimers disease 2,13, which is due to the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein gene location on chromosome 21 9. To date, it has to be determined if this DS morphology is the result of a generalized pathology, due to the amyloid protein, or an abnormal neurodevelopmental processes 9.\nStructural MRI studies have extensively described cortical abnormalities in DS 78910111228 while few studies have reported white matter abnormalities, in these subjects 13,14,22.\nThe directional diffusivities derived from DTI hold promise as specific markers of axonal damage and demyelination. Disorganization of axon fiber architecture leads to unrestricted or isotropic diffusion and, as a result, reduced FA values. A low MD value often indicates a well-organized structure while a high MD indicates disorganization in structure 29. The role of radial and axial diffusivity is debated; radial diffusivity, the diffusion of water perpendicular to white matter fibers, increases in response to demyelination and dysmyelination. In contrast, a decrease in axial diffusivity, the diffusion of water parallel to white matter fibers, is indicative of axonal damage 30. In contrast, some authors report that the increase in AD could represent the first significant change in Alzheimers disease, but it is not a function of disease progression 313233.\nIn this DTI study, we found a FA decrease and a MD, AD, and RD increase, in DS subjects compared to control subjects, in the region of the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculum (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculum (ILF), and the cortico-spinal tract (CST), bilaterally. Moreover, other white matter structures (superior longitudinal fasciculum (SLF), the minor and major forceps, the cingulum, and the uncinate fasciculum) were involved by DTI parameters changes.\nOur findings are in accordance with those from Powell et al. 22, which previously described the involvement of the ATR, IFOF, and ILF in DS. The involvement of ATR is crucial for the development of typical signs of DS dementia (Fig. 2). The ATR belongs to the limbic circuit and connects the thalamus to the fronto-orbital cortex. A damage of this tract could prevent the correct connection with amygdala and memory circuit. The ATR includes three neuro-transmitter pathways: the dopaminergic, the serotoninergic, and the noradrenergic. All of them control and modulate the behavior besides the cognitive sphere, mood, attention, and satisfaction. Our finding, showing a significant FA reduction in ATR, could thus represent one of biomarkers of the following cognitive decline, already present in asymptomatic juvenile subjects. Moreover, several studies 34,35 suggest that early dementia symptoms consist of personality and behavior changes.\nThe other involved Fasciculi have a similar role in cognitive and attention deficits. The ILF connects visual areas and temporo-mesial cortex; its damage determines visual agnosia, visual amnesia, and reduced visual reactivity. Similarly, the IFOF takes part in attention and visual processes. Finally, the FA reduction evidenced in the CST could be related to known deficit, yet described 36. Gait disturbance and motor deficits are common condition in DS subjects. Rigoldi et al. 36 reported a strong correlation between cerebellar vermis volume reduction and gait quality and between gait asymmetry and gray matter volume reduction in some cerebral areas.\nPowell and colleagues 22 reported the involvement of other white matter tracts in DS, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor, the frontal and temporal portions of the uncinate fasciculus, and the cingulum. Their results showed that non-demented adult with DS older than 35 years have greater white matter disruption in frontal lobes compared to both age matched healthy control subjects and demented DS subjects. Previous imaging studies have reported reduced frontal lobe volume in DS children and adults without dementia 1 and altered white matter integrity 14. Reduced frontal lobe volumes are also consistent with the earliest manifestations of dementia in DS that include changes in personality and behavior, pragnosia, and socially deficient communication 28,37.\nIn our study, we did not find FA changes of these latter additional tracts although alterations characterized by an increased MD, AD, and RD were already evident. We suggest that this could be related to two possible reasons. First, the different age of participants in the two studies. As already mentioned, we recruited non-demented DS subjects younger than subjects studied by Powell et al. 22 (over 35); in these subjects, the involvement of these tracts may not have happened yet. Second, DTI technique could be not sufficiently able to detect pre-dementia structural damages, as suggested by Fenoll et al. 14. Indeed, Powell et al. 22 suggested that alterations in FA values were significantly more evident when dementia has been clinically manifested.\nSince DTI technique has been extensively used to characterize both normal aging 16 and early dementia syndrome 38 and it have been validated by several post-mortem studies 39,40, we support the first hypothesis as responsible for our results. In particular, concerning this topic, MD, AD, and RD seems to be more sensible than FA, showing subtle changes that did not reach the microstructural damage visible in FA maps. This hypothesis is supported by Acosta et al., which, in a study on Alzheimer disease, assessed that AD predates changes in RDFA and appears to represent something other than axonal loss. Similarly, our results on MD and AD showed additional white matter tracts involved in pathological condition that FA and RD maps were not able to evidence.\nOur findings have not been able to either discard or confirm the Teipels hypothesis 13 of the involvement of corpus callosum as a cognitive biomarker for DS. We found no evidence of white matter alterations in the corpus callosum, with the exception of a partial involvement of minor and major The ATR belongs to the limbic circuit and it connects the thalamus to the fronto-orbital cortex (d, tractographic reconstrucions). A damage of this tract (e) could prevent the correct connection with amigdala and memory circuit through three neuro-transmitter ways: the dopaminergic, the serotoninergic and the noradrenergic that modulate the behavior besides the cognitive sphere, mood, attention, and satisfaction forceps in MD maps. In particular, we did not find any involvement axonal projections from parietal, temporal, and occipital associative cortical areas to posterior corpus callosum, as supposed by Teipel et al.\nMain limitations of this study are the relatively small sample size and anisotropic spatial resolution. The former confer to our study a merely exploratory nature, albeit current literature results are rather verified. The second, introducing possible bias in the quantitative assessment of anisotropy and since larger voxels are more likely to contain multiple fiber tract orientation, makes voxel-based analysis prone to partial volume effects and registration artifacts. However, the quality of our preprocessing pipeline (registration and artifacts correction) as well as the choice of limits voxel-wise analyses across participating groups in those voxels with FA  0.20, made us quite confident to have successfully exclude peripheral tracts where significant inter-subject variability and partial volume effects with gray matter could exist.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated, by means of DTI-MRI, WM changes in specific regions of young, non-demented DS subjects and that MD changes seem to precede FA ones. This information might have a great impact in the therapeutic management, in particular in better adapting the timing of therapies to counteract the toxic effect of the deposition of Aβ that leads to oxidative stress 9,36. Whether DTI changes reflect cortical volume loss or precede it 22 should be demonstrated in the next future.",

    "abstract": "Background CKD is associated with abnormalities in cerebral blood flow, cerebral neurochemical concentrations, and white matter integrity. Each of these is associated with adverse clinical consequences in the non-CKD population, which may explain the high prevalence of dementia and stroke in ESKD. Because cognition improves after kidney transplantation, comparing these brain abnormalities before and after kidney transplantation may identify potential reversibility in ESKD-associated brain abnormalities. Methods In this study of patients with ESKD and age-matched healthy controls, we used arterial spin labeling to assess the effects of kidney transplantation on cerebral blood flow and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to measure cerebral neurochemical concentrations (N-acetylaspartate, choline, glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, and total creatine). We also assessed white matter integrity measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) with diffusion tensor imaging. We used a linear mixed model analysis to compare longitudinal, repeated brain magnetic resonance imaging measurements before, 3 months after, and 12 months after transplantation and compared these findings with those of healthy controls. Results Study participants included 29 patients with ESKD and 19 controls; 22 patients completed posttransplant magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral blood flow, which was higher in patients pretransplant compared with controls (P50.003), decreased post-transplant (P,0.001) to values in controls. Concentrations of neurochemicals choline and myo-inositol that were higher pretransplant compared with controls (P50.001 and P,0.001, respectively) also normalized post-transplant (P,0.001 and P,0.001, respectively). FA increased (P50.001) and MD decreased (P,0.001) post-transplant. Conclusions Certain brain abnormalities in CKD are reversible and normalize with kidney transplantation. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these brain abnormalities and to explore interventions to mitigate them even in patients who cannot be transplanted.",

      "text": "neurochemical concentrations, and decreased white matter integrity. 3456789101112131415 Patients with CKD have elevated CBF, 7,8 likely secondary to disrupted cerebral autoregulation from dysfunctional bloodbrain barrier due to endothelial inflammation. 16,17 In addition, hemodialysis causes acute changes in the CBF, associated with ultrafiltration volume and change in hematocrit-major determinants of blood viscosity. 18 These changes in cerebral hemodynamics can contribute to increase in stroke. 5,19,20 Patients with CKD also have dysregulation of cerebral neurochemicals. Cerebral osmolytes, such as myo-inositol (mI) and choline-containing compounds (Cho), are elevated in CKD. 4,91011 Although causality is unproven, lower eGFR is correlated with higher concentrations of some of these osmolytes. 21 Increase in cerebral osmolytes can alter cerebral osmotic pressure and impair cellular structure and function. 22 In addition, patients with CKD have decreased white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 12131415 a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to measure the diffusion of water molecules along nerve tracts. 23 Each of these abnormalities is associated with cognitive impairment in the non-CKD population 24,25 and may be responsible for the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in ESKD. 26 Although many conditions associated with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer disease and traumatic brain injury, have irreversible brain abnormalities, 27282930 due to the unique nature of brain disease in CKD, it is possible that some of these abnormalities are reversible. Because cognition improves after kidney transplantation (KT), 31 we hypothesize that brain abnormalities will also improve with KT. We used sophisticated noninvasive MRI methods to characterize the structural and physiologic brain abnormalities in ESKD and determine their reversibility with KT. We examined CBF, cerebral neurochemical concentrations, and white matter integrity longitudinally in patients before and after KT. This study builds upon the results of our prior study 31 and reports a comprehensive evaluation of brain abnormalities pre-KT to post-KT.",

The study was approved by the institutional review board and is registered in the US National Library of Medicine (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01883349). Patients wait listed for KT were enrolled and followed for 12 months post-KT. Brain MRI was performed at baseline, 3 months post-KT, and 12 months post-KT.

    "Significance Statement": {
      "text": "Kidney disease is accompanied by structural and physiologic brain abnormalities and increased risk of dementia and stroke. Because RRT with dialysis does not normalize these brain abnormalities, the authors evaluated the possible benefit of kidney transplantation. Using magnetic resonance imaging methods to measure brain abnormalities before and after kidney transplantation, they demonstrated that this intervention normalizes cerebral blood flow, neurochemical concentrations, and white matter integrity. They also found that these changes persist beyond the initial posttransplantation period and thus, cannot be attributed to periprocedural interventions, such as steroids. Their findings suggest that brain abnormalities in kidney disease may be reversible. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these brain abnormalities and to explore interventions to prevent and mitigate them in patients who cannot undergo kidney transplantation.",

    "Statistical Analyses": {
      "text": "Baseline characteristics between patients and controls were analyzed using descriptive statistics. For categorical variables, differences in frequencies were measured using a nonparametric Fisher exact test. For continuous variables, mean differences were measured using a two-sample t test. Assumptions of normality for the t test were inspected by the quantilequantile plot and histogram. For clinical measurements, unadjusted one-way repeated ANOVA was used to measure the continuous outcomes between patient pre-KT and patient post-KT groups. Residuals were assessed to evaluate the fit of the underlying model assumptions. Each imaging modality (ASL, MRSI, and DTI) was analyzed separately. Imaging data in controls, as well as preand post-KT groups, were adjusted for covariates of age, 32 race, 33 sex, 34 and education level 35,36 that can confound results. Because the exact time for KT is unpredictable, a linear mixed model approach was used to account for repeated observations on participants. A linear mixed effects model was fitted using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure by incorporating correlations among the responses. To model these correlations, we included random effects in the linear predictor. Specifically, we used a random intercept for each subject, which provides a compound symmetry covariance structure. This linear mixed model is more flexible than repeated measures ANOVA as it allows for variation in time between scans and in the number of scans per participant and allows the inclusion of participants who have missing data at one or more time points without requiring an imputation method. 37,38 Each participants individual intercept was estimated in the model using the random intercept term. Age was calculated at every time point in order to both control for the effect of age and function as the time variable. All available imaging data were included in the model to detect any group differences between patients pre-KT, patients post-KT, and controls. The pre-KT group includes both pre-KT scans, if available; the post-KT group includes both the 3-and 12-month post-KT scans, if available. The effects of group (control, pre-KT, and post-KT) and covariates (age, race, sex, and education level) were included as fixed effects. Residual plots were assessed to evaluate the model fit. We performed pairwise testing of the three groups using F and t tests as appropriate. We constructed scatterplots mapping each participants observed measures over time (chronological age), showing both the overall change with aging and the effect of KT. As a test for whether there would be any change associated with time alone, for those patients who had repeated pre-KT MRI, the pre-KT scans were compared using the Wilcoxon nonparametric signed rank test. Results with P,0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio (version 3.6.3) and SAS (version 9.4; The SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "We found that structural and physiologic brain abnormalities in ESKD reversed post-KT. CBF, which was elevated pre-KT, decreased post-KT to levels in controls, both globally and in each anatomic region of gray matter analyzed. ChoCr and mICr, which were also elevated pre-KT, normalized post-KT. Finally, with an increase in FA and decrease in MD, white matter integrity also improved post-KT. We also noted the expected age-related changes in brain measurements that were controlled for in our linear mixed model. The reversibility of brain abnormalities in CKD might have important mechanistic and therapeutic implications. Potential reversibility underscores an opportunity to develop improved management strategies other than KT for patients who cannot be transplanted. Better dialysis techniques that include targeting dialysis-related ischemia to reduce metabolic derangements could help prevent and perhaps mitigate some of these abnormalities. Preservation of residual renal function to retain tubular secretion may also positively affect these brain abnormalities. The overarching effect of our observations would be to identify patients with reversible versus irreversible brain abnormalities and to devise strategies to reverse brain abnormalities with the goal of improving cognition. Cognitive impairment is common in patients with ESKD undergoing KTevaluation 39 and affects eligibility for KT. 40 However, given that cognitive impairment and brain abnormalities might improve with KT, more of these patients who are currently rejected for KT might get transplanted.\nElevated CBF seen in our patients pre-KT is consistent with other studies in adult 8,17 and pediatric 41 patients with CKD. Disruption of cerebral autoregulation due to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction affecting the blood-brain barrier may play a role. 16,17 Alternatively, elevated CBF could be secondary to increased metabolic demand. Our results that CBF decreased pre-to post-KT is consistent with prior crosssectional 42 and longitudinal studies, 43 although some other studies found conflicting results, 44,45 possibly due to differences in the methodology of assessing CBF. ASL has the advantage of repeatability and ability to quantify global and regional CBF. 46 Because hemodialysis preferentially affects the watershed areas of the brain, 47 we also explored regional changes in the brain in addition to global changes. All regions showed a decrease in CBF (Table 3), pointing to systemic etiologies, such as reduced inflammation and improvement of cerebral autoregulation. It is also possible that CBF decreased due to the vasoconstrictive effects of calcineurin inhibitors. Distinct from the KT-related change in CBF, we observed an age-related decrease in CBF in all participants, a wellestablished phenomenon seen in the general population. 48 Similar to other published studies, we found that patients pre-KT had higher cerebral ChoCr and mICr compared with controls. 4,91011 Both ChoCr and mICr decreased post-KT. Cho is a phospholipid cell membrane precursor and represents breakdown products, such as phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphorylcholine, and phosphorylcholine. 22 Importantly, Cho is also a precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide, a marker of cardiovascular disease and mortality. 49,50 mI, primarily found in glial cells, is involved in the phosphoinositide-mediated signal transduction and is a marker of inflammation or gliosis. 22 High plasma mI is also associated with the high prevalence of peripheral polyneuropathy in ESKD. 51 With their relative small sizes (mol wt 105 and 180 gmol, respectively), both compounds are readily filtered by the glomeruli and eliminated with tubular secretion. 52,53 Both plasma 51,54 and intracerebral Cho and mI concentrations are elevated in CKD 21 and decrease only slightly with dialysis. 9 Cho and mI are both major cerebral osmolytes, and high concentrations can increase osmotic pressure in the brain, cause cellular edema, and alter cellular structure and function. Both compounds are transported from the plasma to the brain through the blood-brain barrier by diffusion and carrier mediated transporter systems. 55,56 Because of the blood-brain barrier, changes in plasma concentrations of neurochemicals do not correlate with cerebral concentrations in healthy individuals. 57 However, with the disruption of the blood-brain barrier in CKD, higher serum concentrations could theoretically affect cerebral neurochemical concentrations. Our study indicates normalization of Cho and mI post-KT, perhaps by better elimination with tubular secretion, 52,53 which cannot be restored with dialysis or measured by creatinine clearance or serum creatinine-based eGFR. Improvement in these neurochemicals after KT could restore cerebral osmotic regulation, lower cellular edema, and improve cell function and cognition. Similar to a prior cross-sectional study, 9 we did not see any differences in the levels of GlxCr and NAACr between controls and patients pre-KT, suggesting that CKD does not affect these neurochemicals as much as Cho and mI. Consistent with this hypothesis, there was no change in GlxCr and NAA Cr pre-to post-KT. Glutamine is mainly found in glia and is a precursor to glutamate, 22 the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the neurons. NAA is also an osmolyte located in the cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of neurons and is a marker of neuronal number, density, and integrity. 58 NAACr is often reduced in neurodegenerative diseases and may not be affected in CKD. 22 Similar to our prior study, 31 KT resulted in an increase in FA and a decrease in MD. A recent study demonstrated similar findings. 43 These changes in FA and MD indicate decreased free dispersion and greater axial movement of water molecules along the white matter tracts. A decrease in cerebral osmolytes and improvement in cerebral edema as described above can explain these DTI results. Pre-KT, even with maintenance dialysis, the clearance of substances that are eliminated by tubular secretion is reduced and can result in (often subclinical) cerebral edema. Although we have previously shown that patients on dialysis have lower FA and higher MD compared with healthy controls, 59 we did not find FA and MD values to be significantly different in patients pre-KT and controls in this study. This could be because of the small sample size and single MRI measurements in controls leading to a larger SD.\nThe evidence that dialysis has shortand long-term deleterious effects on brain health is rapidly accumulating. 4,5,910111213141519,20 Our MRSI and DTI results indicate normalization of cerebral edema post-KT, a finding that is not observed with dialysis. In fact, cerebral edema increases with longer dialysis vintage and higher ultrafiltration volumes. 60 Similarly, change in CBF with dialysis can be detrimental. 2 We demonstrate reversibility in abnormalities in CBF, neurochemical concentrations, and white matter integrity in ESKD. Because our study protocol included repeated pre-KT MRI in patients who did not receive KT within 1 year, we were able to compare pre-KT MRIs. We did not observe any change in brain abnormalities. Although we do not have the power to make definite conclusions in this study, our findings are consistent with our previous work. 59 Normalized brain abnormalities even after 12 months post-KT indicate that the post-KT changes were not due to acute effects of KT, such as steroids, but a phenomenon that persists beyond the immediate post-KT period. Despite the modest sample size, our longitudinal approach, linear mixed model analysis, and a uniform change in measures among patients strengthen our findings. For example, all patients had a decrease in CBF after KT. Unlike other studies, our CBF calculations were corrected for hematocrit, which affects blood viscosity. 61 Because hematocrit changes following KT, correction for hematocrit is important for accurate CBF measurements in ESKD. Our models were adjusted for age, 32 race, 33 sex, 34 and level of education. 35,36 Age in particular is associated with changes in brain volume and function, and age-related changes observed over many years could be larger than changes observed in the 12 months post-KT. Another strength was the measurement of regional CBF, FA, and MD changes in addition to global changes.\nIn summary, abnormalities in CBF, neurochemical concentrations, and white matter integrity in CKD are normalized with KT. This reversibility in brain abnormalities has important implications in appreciating and managing the risk of dementia and stroke in our CKD population. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these brain abnormalities, to understand the role of residual kidney function in preserving brain health on dialysis, and to explore innovations in RRTs to mitigate these abnormalities even in patients who cannot be transplanted.",

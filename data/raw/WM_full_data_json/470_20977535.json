    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Patients with small vessel disease show high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images that represent ischemic cell damage. However, despite a similar degree of ischemic change, the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, neuropsychological tests, a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits, and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed. RESULTS Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test. Unexpectedly, cognitive deficits in most neuropsychological tests, even in some frontal tasks, were associated with disruption of posterior white matter integrities. Motor deficits correlated with both supra-and infratentorial lesions. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that in patients with small vessel disease who show cognitive and motor impairments, a specific distribution of fiber tract damage is more related with clinical deficits than is the severity of the total ischemia.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) is a group of disorders characterized by cognitive impairment associated with ischemic changes in the white matter or deep nuclei (basal ganglia or thalamus) caused by small vessel disease. SVCI may consist of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) related to small vessel disease (subcortical vascular MCI, svMCI), which may be a prodromal stage of SVaD. 1 In these disorders, an interruption of the subcorticalcortical connection by ischemic changes leads to the presentation of diverse clinical features including impaired cognitive and motor funcions and abnormal behaviors. 2 Small vessel diseases manifest as white matter hyperintensity (WMH) or lacunes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many studies have focused on the clinical significance of WMH but the results are inconsistent. Some studies suggested that the distribution rather than the severity of WMH relates to cognitive deficits, 345 whereas another study came to the opposite conclusion. 6 These inconsistencies may arise from methodological differences in quantifying WMH among studies. Studies comparing the visual scoring method with volumetric analysis to measure WMH suggested that the visual rating scales display ceiling effects and poor discrimination of absolute lesion volume. 7,8 Another important factor that can explain these inconsistencies is the variability of the pathologies that underlie WMH, which are composed of various lesions, ranging from mild perivascular alteration to loss of various fibers, multiple small cavitations and marked arteriosclerosis. 9 Therefore, the indirect information provided by only high signals on brain MRI is quite limited.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), on the other hand, is a sensitive tool for detecting microstructural changes in white matter. 10 A recent study showed that abnormal DTI parameters significantly correlated with the level of metabolite contents of neuron, which suggests that DTI can identify axonal disruption in the white matter tracts. 11 Although damage to the white matter is ciritical in SVCI, there have been very few studies investigating the relationship between the clinical indices and abnormalities of DTI parameters. 12,13 Furthermore, most DTI studies have used manual tracing of region of interest (ROI) and thus included only limited areas rather than searching whole-brain regions. 13 In contrast, a recent study tried DTI analyses using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in patients with leukoaraiosis and found Copyright  C 2010 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 317 that motor impairment correlates with DTI parameters. 14 That study, however, was based on a small sample size and failed to reveal any relationship with cognitive deficits. 14 The aim of this study was to investigate neural correlates of both cognitive and motor deficits in a large sample of patients with SVCI using DTI analysis with the VBM method. Since varying degrees of white matter and basal ganglia lesions are observed in patients with small vessel disease, 15 we enrolled only those patients who exhibited extensive WMH in order to minimize these differences.",

Patients with SVaD met the diagnostic criteria for the vascular dementia proposed by DSM IV 16 and had a signficant ischemia on MRI that was defined as a cap or band 10 mm as well as a deep white matter (DWM) lesion 25 mm, as modifed from Fazekas ischemia criteria. Patients with svMCI were diagnosed with Petersen criteria 17 with the following modifications: (1) subjective cognitive complaint by the patient or hisher caregiver; (2) normal general cognitive function as defined by a score 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); (3) normal Activity of Daily Living (ADL) score both judged clinically and on an ADL scale 18 ; (4) objective memory decline below the 16th percentile on neuropsychological tests; (5) not having dementia; and (6) a subcortical vascular feature defined as both focal neurological symptomsign and the significant ischemia on MRI, as in the SVaD. Patients were excluded if they had cortical lesions, corticosubcortical nonlacunar territorial infarcts, hemorrhage, or normal pressure hydrocephalus. Four of 94 total patients were excluded due to comorbid conditions; three with hydrocephalus, and one with basilar aneurysm. For the remaining 90 patients, we conducted detailed neurological examination including Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) to evaluate motor impairment and laboratory tests to exclude secondary causes of cognitive deficits. Patients also underwent neuropsychological tests and brain MRI. Twenty-nine patients were excluded because of incomplete study; 21 patients failed to have 3-Tesla MRI, 1 failed to complete neuropsychological test, and 7 did not receive the PEPS. Total 61 patients, comprising 34 SVaD and 27 svMCI patients, were included in the final analysis.",

First, we segmented the areas of WMH that had a higher intensity value than apparently normal white matter in FLAIR MRI using the FMRIB Automatic Segmentation Tool (FAST) in FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). FLAIR MRI permits the coding of pathologies as bright intracranial regions. Although we classified the FLAIR MRI using the information for intensity and location, considerable overlap of signal intensities between these classifications poses a problem. Therefore, we removed the false WMH regions automatically using white matter mask defined in T1-weighted MRI. Finally, the volume of WMH was measured by voxel counting of extracted WMH volume.",

The first step was to correct each raw DT-MRI data set for motion and eddy current distortions using affine registration to a reference volume using FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT), which is available through the FSL (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). Diffusion tensor matrices from sets of 45 diffusion-weighted images were generated using a general linear fitting algorithm, and then the three eigen values (λ i , i  1, 2, 3) and eigen vectors (ε i , i  1, 2, 3) were calculated via matrix diagonalization. The fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of directional selectivity of water diffusion, and the mean diffusivity (MD), an index of the average molecular motion independent of any tissue directionality were determined for every voxel according to standard methods, using FDT software. Customized template image creation and preprocessing analysis were carried out using a VBM technique implemented in SPM5 (http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. ukspm). For the customized template creation, the B0 DTI volumes from the 61 subjects were spatially normalized to the standard T2-MRI template, based on 152 healthy subjects from the Montreal Neurological Institute (average T1 brain image constructed from 152 normal subjects at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada). The spatially normalized B0 images were averaged to provide the template in stereotactic space. Subsequently, the B0 images from all 61 subjects were spatially normalized to the customized template. The parameters resulting from this spatial normalization step were then applied to the FA map of each subject. Thus, we obtained 50 FA maps of matrices and their voxel size was 2  2  2 mm 3 in common Talairach space. The registered FA images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (8-mm full-width at half maximum).",

The remaining clusters (presented in Figs 1 and2) revealed significant correlation between the DTI parameters and the cognitive scores. The lower scores on delayed recall of SVLT and RCFT significantly correlated with the increased MD values in the temporal white matter. A lower RCFT score correlated with a decreased FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum and bilateral posterior parts of periventricular white matter (PVWM) and with an increased MD in the bilateral PVWM. A lower BNT score correlated with a decreased FA in the left medial temporal white matter. Impairment on the backward digit span task correlated with a decreased FA and an increased MD in the extensive white matter including both PVWM and DWM. Decreased phonemic fluency correlated with decreased FA and increased MD only in the left PVWM. In contrast, reduced semantic fluency correlated with decreased FA in the corpus callosum and increased MD in the bilateral PVWM and right subcortical structures. The Stroop color reading test mainly correlated with decreased FA in the posterior PVWM including the temporal lobe and cingulate gyrus and with increased MD in the right medial temporal white matter, corpus callosum, white matter in the anterior cingulate gyrus and lingual gyrus.",

    "General Discussion": {
      "text": "We explored neural correlates of clinical deficits in patients with SVCI using DTI analysis with the VBM method. Our study enrolled the large number of SVCI patients with varying degrees of motor and cognitive impairments associated with severe WMH, while the previous study involved elderly individuals with leukoaraiosis who were not impaired or impaired in only one item on the Instrumental ADL (IADL) scale, regardless of their cognitive status. 25 Therefore, it is possible that our sample may represent a more homogeneous group than did the previous study group.\nOne interesting finding of our study was that cognitive deficits correlated only with supratentorial but not with infratentorial lesions, whereas motor deficits correlated with both supraand infratentorial lesions. In the clinical setting, we often see patients with SVCI who have the same amount of high signal change in the supratentorial white matter, but the patients vary in terms of motor deficits. One possible account for this is that there is variation in the involvement of the infratentorial areas such as the brainstem and cerebellum in the presence of similar degrees of white matter ischemia in the supratentorial areas.\nMost of the previous studies investigating the relationship between ischemic volume and cognitive dysfunction found that the frontal ischemic burden is most strongly associated with cognitive deficits. 26,27 However, our results suggest that disruption of the posterior white matter integrity is also related to poor performance on cognitive tests, even in the task for frontal functioning. We suggest two possible explanations for this unexpected finding. First, involvement of cholinergic pathways in SVCI may explain the correlation between the cognitive deficits and disruption of the posterior white matter. The cholinergic pathway begins at the nucleus basalis and projects to most of the cortical areas, and these trajectories are vulnerable to strategically located vascular lesions. 28 The medial and lateral cholinergic pathways run forward to the orbitofrontal white matter as well as backward to the occipital white matter below the optic radiation. 28 Therefore, damage to this pathway may result in cognitive dysfunction. Second, the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and posterior white matter disruption may be related to the involvement of long association fibers, such as the inferior fronto-occipital (IFO) fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), passing through a posterior part of PVWM. These long association fibers are associated with processing of visual information. 29,30 Thus, damage to those regions is likely to affect performances of tasks, including the RCFT copying test or the Stroop test.\nAnother interesting finding of our study was that although WMHs on MRI in SVCI usually occur symmetrically, white matter disruptions on DTI responsible for cognitive dysfunction occur asymmetrically. For instance, the visual memory test correlated with a lack of right-sided white matter integrity; the naming test was lateralized to the left; and the Stroop color reading test was associated with bilateral lesions. However, motor symptoms were related to rather symmetric involvement of white matter tracts.",

    "Cognition and DTI Correlates": {
      "text": "Memory dysfunction in patients with SVCI is characterized by impairment of retrieval and working memory that are known to be related to a disruption of prefrontal-subcortical circuits. 31,32 However, our results showed that poor performance on the delayed verbal and visual recall test was related to damage in the temporal lobe white matter, parahhipocampal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus. Memory dysfunction is typically not an early finding in SVCI. 33 As the ischemia progresses, however, extensive involvement of white matter including the temporo-occipital areas as well as the prefrontal circuits may result in memory deficits. Thus, the memory deficits associated with temporal white matter disruption may reflect a highly progressed stage of ischemia. Alternatively, our results can be interpreted as mixed pathology: vascular combined with Alzheimers pathology.\nErrors in copying figures in SVCI may be primarily attributed to executive dysfunction manifesting as poor organization, perseveration, and ommision. 34,35 Contrary to our expections, however, posterior rather than anterior white matter was associated with visuospatial dysfunction, which may have been caused by disruption of long association fibers such as ILF and IFO, as mentioned in the general discussion.\nCompared to other tests, impairment in frontal tasks was associated with more extensive damage of the white matter. In addition, DWM in the temporo-occipital areas was involved; these areas are known to be cholinergic trajectories. Acetylcholine, a major neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system, is related to attention, learning, and memory functions. 36 Therefore, involvement of these pathways seems to be associated with dysfunction in frontal tasks that require complex cognitive processing including attention and working memory. These find-ings thus support the idea that strategic involvement of specific white matter is critical for developing cognitive defects. 37",

    "Motor Deficits and DTI Correlates": {
      "text": "The total PEPS score possibly representing general motor deficits correlated with the brainstem motor pathways as well as supratentorial white matter including the corpus callosum and both anterior and posterior PVWM.\nAlthough subscale motor functions shared these neural correlates for general motor deficit, there were some distinctive patterns among the subscales. First, lesions for corticobulbar dysfunction differed from those for corticospinal dysfunction in that brainstem lesions were more predominant with corticobulbar symptoms. Second, compared to lesions for gait disturbance, those for corticospinal and corticobular dysfunctions did not involve the corpus callosum, particularly, the anterior corpus callosum. Thus, the anterior corpus callosum may be one of the specific areas related to gait disturbace. Our findings are consistent with prior studies that investigated DTI correlates of gait disturbance in patients with leukoaraiosis, 14 or alcoholism, 38,39 in which the corpus callosum was identified as a critical area for developing gait dysfunction. In addition to the corpus callosum, our study also found that damage to motor pathways in the brainstem, corona radiata, and internal capsule was related to gait abnormality.",

      "text": "First, our results provide evidence that the region-specific damage of the white matter is more related with clinical deficits than is the amount of the total ischemia. This finding, therefore, may explain wide variation of cognitive or motor deficits in patients with SVCI even if they show comparable degrees of white matter ischemia on the brain MRI. Second, in the presence of similar degree of supratentorial white matter ischemia, some patients show more remarkable motor deficits than the others, which may be partly explained by infratentorial disruption of white matter tracts. Third, our results also revealed that in addition to frontal-subcortical circuits, disruption of the posterior white matter integrity is also important for inducing various cognitive dysfunctions in patients with SVCI.",

    "abstract": "Background Cognitive dysfunction is the most common non-motor symptom in Parkinsons disease (PD), and timely detection of a slight cognitive decline is crucial for early treatment and prevention of dementia. This study aimed to build a machine learning model based on intra-andor intervoxel metrics extracted from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to automatically classify PD patients without dementia into mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and normal cognition (PD-NC) groups. Methods We enrolled PD patients without dementia (52 PD-NC and 68 PD-MCI subtypes) who were assigned to the training and test datasets in an 8:2 ratio. Four intravoxel metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), and two novel intervoxel metrics, local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient (LDHs) and Kendalls coefficient concordance (LDHk), were extracted from the DTI data. Decision tree, random forest, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models based on individual and combined indices were built for classification, and model performance was assessed and compared via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, feature importance was evaluated using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. Results The XGBoost model based on a combination of the intra-and intervoxel indices achieved the best classification performance, with an accuracy of 91.67, sensitivity of 92.86, and AUC of 0.94 in the test dataset. SHAP analysis showed that the LDH of the brainstem and MD of the right cingulum (hippocampus) were important features. Conclusions More comprehensive information on white matter changes can be obtained by combining intra-and intervoxel DTI indices, improving classification accuracy. Furthermore, machine learning methods based on DTI indices can be used as alternatives for the automatic identification of PD-MCI at the individual level.",

    "Background": {
      "text": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common nonmotor symptoms of PD 1, including PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD with dementia (PDD). PD-MCI is an intermediate state between PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PDD, with a prevalence of approximately 30 2, that can progress over time to either PD-NC or PDD 1,3. However, cognitive decline tends to be slow and insidious, and PD-MCI is often overlooked by patients and clinicians. Once the disease progresses to PDD, it seriously affects the quality of life of the patient. Accurate diagnosis of PD-MCI is essential for effective intervention and prevention of PDD.\nThe current diagnosis of PD-MCI mainly depends on clinical symptoms and neuropsychological tests, but some challenges remain in terms of the homogeneity of the neuropsychological test results, and the testing process is time consuming and labour intensive. Therefore, there is a need for an easier and more accurate method to establish the diagnosis of PD-MCI.\nThe classical mechanism underlying PD-MCI is the abnormal accumulation of Lewy bodies 4 and β-amyloid (Aβ) 5 in neuronal cell bodies and axons accompanied by damage to glial cells, demyelination of axons, and increased microglial concentrations in the extracellular space. Structural MR studies 678 have confirmed that the progression of cognitive impairment in PD is closely related to white matter (WM) damage and that the range of WM hyperintensity is a moderate risk factor for cognitive impairment 7. Moreover, WM microstructural changes occur prior to grey matter volume atrophy 9.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques are currently recognized as the most reliable noninvasive methods for quantifying WM fibre integrity, demonstrating greater sensitivity than conventional MRI in revealing WM microstructural damage 10. Previous DTI studies calculated a series of intravoxel DTI indices, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), based on a diffusion tensor model and confirmed that the WM microstructure deteriorates across stages of cognitive decline in PD patients 8. Specifically, decreased FA and increased MD, mainly in the bilateral frontal white matter 9,11, corpus callosum 12, and temporal regions 13, are related to cognitive dysfunction. Recently, Gong et al. proposed a novel intervoxel metric named local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) 14. LDH is independent of the diffusion model and can reveal intervoxel diffusion properties by capturing the overall coherence of water molecule diffusion within a neighbourhood; it reflects the microstructural coherence of the underlying WM fibres and provides additional insights beyond traditional intravoxel metrics. Some recent studies have applied LDH parameters to the detection of WM microstructure abnormalities in vascular cognitive impairment 15, epilepsy 16, type 2 diabetes 17, and blepharospasm 18, demonstrating regions of variation that differed from those of intravoxel diffusion metrics. Moreover, LDH can help predict the prognosis of stroke patients 19. However, LDH alterations in PD or PD-MCI patients have not been fully explored.\nIn summary, traditional statistical methods for comparing groups have demonstrated significant differences in WM microstructure between PD-MCI patients and PD-NC patients, providing new evidence for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD. However, these studies have not been translated into suitable biomarkers for identifying PD-MCI at the individual level. Additionally, it is unknown which metric is the most accurate and useful for predicting PD-MCI. In particular, the role of LDH is unclear. Machine learning classification provides a powerful method for predicting an individuals disease status based on MRI data and has been applied to generate imaging biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease 20 and Parkinsons disease 21. Tree model algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are relatively basic and widely used classes of models in machine learning. These tree models are built with a small amount of data, have a moderately complex algorithm time, and are more interpretable than neural network algorithms. Studies have confirmed the potential of tree model algorithms in studies on automatic PD identification 21.\nThis study aimed to develop a machine learning model based on DTI data to automatically classify PD patients without dementia as PD-MCI and PD-NC, thus providing a more convenient method for the early clinical detection of MCI. We hypothesized that tree models employing the means of DTI indices extracted from atlas-based WM segmentation as input features would be helpful for PD-MCI diagnosis, and combining intra-and intervoxel DTI metrics could improve prediction precision. Finally, we assessed the correlations between the regional DTI parameter values of selected features and neuropsychological scores and calculated the importance of the features of the best model using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to validate and explain the model.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study succeeded in developing a machine learning model based on DTI metrics to accurately discriminate PD-MCI patients from PD patients without dementia. The main contributions were as follows: First, to our knowledge, this was the first time that LDHs and LDHk (novel intervoxel DTI indices) were used as classification metrics. We confirmed that these metrics can be used as a complement to intravoxel metrics to improve the classification accuracy for PD-NC and PD-MCI patients.\nSecond, the XGBoost model based on the combined intra-and intervoxel metrics achieved a classification accuracy of 91.67 and an AUC of 0.94 in the test dataset and was the best performing model. Finally, by applying the SHAP method to interpret the best model, the LDHk values of the pontine crossing tract (PCT) were found to be important features, as were the MD values of the right cingulum (hippocampus).\nAlthough neuropsychological testing remains the primary method for assessing the presence or absence of cognitive decline in PD patients, neuroimaging studies have observed brain structural and functional changes in patients with PD-MCI by measuring grey matter volume, white matter damage, and resting-state functional activity 27. For years, machine learning studies used neuroimaging or electrophysiology data to build classifiers for PD-MCI. One study found that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals achieved 84 classification accuracy in identifying PD-MCI patients 28. Zhang et al. s study 29 combined EEG and grey matter structural MRI as input features to identify patients with PD-MCI, achieving the highest accuracy of 77. Moreover, Lenfeldt et al. found that white matter DTI values are more sensitive neuroimaging indicators than grey matter atrophy 11. To the best of our knowledge, previous DTI studies have mainly focused on the differences in intravoxel diffusion parameters, finding that cognitive impairment is associated with decreased FA and increased MD, AD, and RD values in multiple WM regions, particularly in the predominantly anterior WM tracts 12,30. Haller et al. attempted to use machine learning algorithms based on intravoxel DTI indicators to diagnose Parkinsons disease 31, with accuracies of up to 97. However, we have not found any research utilizing machine learning models with DTI Fig. 3 ROC curves of each model index in the test datasets. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and are shown in Table 3 features to automatically identify PD-MCI patients. Our study confirms that intervoxel metrics that reflect the microstructural consistency of white matter fibre tracts can complement traditional intravoxel metrics to reveal a comprehensive picture of WM alterations. The reason this phenomenon has not been described appears to be that previous works did not consider intervoxel DTI metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to automatically identify PD-MCI using machine learning methods based on both intra-and intervoxel DTI features. Regarding the machine learning-based algorithms, we found that XGBoost-based algorithms achieved better performance, which is consistent with previous research. Lee et al. confirmed that an XGBoost model based on electroencephalography signals had a good effect in the diagnosis of PD 21, with the highest accuracy rate of 71.4. Shibata et al. applied the XGBoost model based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (a type of MR method reflecting iron deposition) features to classify PD-MCI and PD-NC patients, achieving an accuracy of 79.1 32.\nThis study used SHAP analysis to interpret the best model, which revealed that the MD values of the right cingulum and the LDHk values of the PCT were the most important features, as well as the LDH values of the ML, another region of the brainstem. Statistical analysis revealed that the LDHk value of the PCT in the PD-MCI group was lower than that in the PD-NC group and that in general, the LDHk value of the PCT was positively correlated with the MoCA score. One of the pathological hallmarks of PD is dopaminergic neuron loss, and postmortem studies have confirmed that human brainstem regions, such as the substantia nigra, red nucleus, medial lemniscus, and pontine nucleus, highly express D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs 33. Furthermore, the PCT and ML are the main structural connections of the cerebellothalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits. Various lines of evidence suggest that the CTC circuits play a critical role in the cognitive symptoms of PD. Pathological studies have confirmed the presence of landmark Lewy body pathology aggregates in the cerebellar nuclei and adjacent white matter displayed in PD patients 34,35. Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that the CTC loop mediates the involvement of the cerebellum in higher-order cognitive processes, such as planning, verbal fluency, mental flexibility, abstract reasoning, and working memory; its dysfunction contributes to cognitive dysfunction in PD 36,37. Therefore, our results further support the notion that the CTC circuitry is affected by disease-specific impairments in PD and contributes to cognitive dysfunction in PD. Moreover, the PCT and ML contain topologically arranged projection fibres, and adjacent voxels may project to very different neocortices. Thus, it is possible that when one of the voxels suggests damage, its neighbours remain normal. LDH estimates the overall consistency of diffusion of water molecules between a voxel and its neighbours, and so abnormalities in the PCT and ML may be more sensitive to LDH.\nIn addition, the MD value of the right cingulum (hippocampus) was the second most important feature and was significantly negatively correlated with MoCA scores. Several studies have shown susceptibility alterations in the hippocampus in patients with PD-MCI. The hippocampus plays an important role in the interaction between dopamine transmission and hippocampal synaptic remodelling, and an imbalance in this interaction leads to dementia 38. Neuropathological studies have observed Lewy body pathology (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in the hippocampus of PD patients, and the degree of cognitive impairment is correlated with the degree of Lewy body deposition in the hippocampus 39. Increased MD indicates extensive cellular damage, including oedema and necrosis 10. Multimodal MRI studies have confirmed that injury to the structural integrity and connectivity of the fornix-hippocampal projections is associated with decreased memory test scores in PD patients 40. DTI studies have confirmed that PD-NC patients showed increased fornix MD values compared with those of HCs 40, and PDD patients showed lower hippocampal FA values than PD patients without dementia 13. In this study, the LDHk value of the left fornix (cres)stria terminalis was also decreased in the PD-MCI group. This finding indicates that microstructural damage to the fornix-hippocampal projection plays an important role in the cognitive impairment in PD. The pathological changes in the hippocampus may be relatively dispersed, and the transition from the normal area to the abnormal area is not as sudden as that in the PCT and ML. Therefore, the MD index of the hippocampus has classification importance.\nSeveral limitations of our study should be noted. First, this work is a retrospective study, and prospective studies are needed in the future to validate whether the proposed method can predict the conversion of PD-NC to PD-MCI. Additionally, although this study adopted the simpler level I diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI, one study confirmed that level II criteria did not add value to the level I criteria 24. Second, this study did not further subdivide patients according to cognitive impairment, specifically including (1) frontal-dominant impairment and (2) posteriorcortical-dominant impairment, which is a future research direction we plan to pursue. Finally, the present study only explored the predictive ability of DTI parameters in white matter brain regions for PD-MCI patients, which may be a rather one-sided analysis, and multimodal data (including spatial and temporal features) are needed in the future to fully explore the mechanisms of PD-MCI and increase accuracy of machine learning models, as studied by Bianchetti et al 41.",

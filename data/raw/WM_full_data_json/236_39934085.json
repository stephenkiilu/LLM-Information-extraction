    "abstract": "Background: Frailty is a chronic condition characterised by the progressive decline of multiple physiological functions. There is a critical need to investigate neuroimaging findings in nondemented frail individuals to better understand the underlying mechanisms and implications of frailty on brain health. This paper is aimed at reviewing neuroimaging studies assessing brain changes in nondemented frail individuals to understand the neuropsychological basis of frailty. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on studies focusing on neuroimaging modalities in frailty, including MRI, fMRI, DTI and PET. The review was based on PRISMA instructions and a two-step screening process. The studies evaluating neuroimaging findings of nondemented frail individuals, regardless of publication time or participant age, were included. Data were extracted from the included studies, and the quality of the studies as well as risk of bias was assessed. Results: Out of 1604 studies screened, 22 eligible studies were included. Out of these, 10 studies had good quality, while others had fair quality according to the Newcastle Ottawa scale (NOS). Of these studies, 18 used Fried criteria or a modified version of it to diagnose frailty, while the Edmonton frailty score (EFS), Rockwood and Mitnitski frailty index and frailty index (FI) were implemented by the remaining studies. The MRI findings indicated significant differences in brain structure between nondemented frail and robust individuals, including an increased number and size of white matter hyperintensities, reduced grey matter volume, higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and increased number of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in frail participants compared to the robust ones. The studies showed no significant difference between at-risk and robust groups regarding total intracranial volume (TIV). The number of CMBs was associated with prefrailty status and its severity. fMRI studies showed decreased intranetwork mean functional connectivity (FC) in nondemented frail individuals. DTI studies showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA), higher axial diffusivity (AD) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the nondemented frail group. The PET scan study showed that mean cortical beta-amyloid level was not associated with FI, but the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the anterior and posterior putamen and precuneus region significantly correlated with frailty and its severity. Conclusion: The study reveals significant differences in brain structures between nondemented frail and robust individuals, including increased white matter hyperintensities and reduced grey matter volume. These differences suggest that vascular changes and brain atrophy in nondemented frail individuals may contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia in the future.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frailty is a chronic state of progressive deterioration in multiple physiological functions, leading to adverse health outcomes, disabilities and mortality, particularly in geriatric health 1. Physical frailty (PF) is the condition of having specific physical characteristics, which is further discussed 2,3. There are multiple tools available for assessing frailty status 4. Fried criteria mainly focus on physical aspects and identify frailty by the presence of three or more of five frailty phenotypes: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in the past year), exhaustion, diminished strength (assessed through grip strength), slowness in gait and decreased levels of physical activity 1,5. Prefrailty, on the other hand, is a clinically latent process in individuals with a Fried criteria score of 1-2, predisposing them to frailty 6,7. Patients not falling into either of these two categories are classified as the robust group, predominantly characterised by a 0 score on the Fried criteria. The frailty index (FI) considers frailty as an accumulation of deficits in multiple older adults health-related domains, such as signs and symptoms of a disease, cognitive disorders, functional disabilities, psychological problems and laboratory abnormalities 1,8,9.\nFrailty has been a burden due to its consequences, such as hospitalisation, higher demand for advanced care and falls 10. Despite its significance in geriatric health and the complicated aetiology of this condition, no specific standard definition has been established for frailty. Studies have suggested various scaling instruments to clinically evaluate individuals regarding the stages of frailty 11. Yet, it is crucial that different methods be utilised to unravel the underlying mechanism of this condition. Previous publications have illustrated an association between PF and cognitive impairments 2,12. These findings insinuate that cognitive decline due to various neurodegenerative alterations might have a predictive value for PF. Hence, investigating frail individuals for neurodegenerative changes appears to be a crucial step forward.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a substantial amount of data on macroscopic brain structural alterations, namely white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) volumes, as well as cerebrovascular changes such as microbleeds and small vessel disease 13,14. These findings enable us to investigate the potential associations between frailty and neurodegenerative processes. On the other hand, functional neuroimaging techniques can give insights into activity and connectivity in different brain areas. Functional MRI (fMRI) uses signals from blood flow to evaluate the brain regions functional connectivity (FC) or activation patterns during a task or in a resting state 15. Furthermore, in positron emission tomography (PET), the activity of the various brain regions is mapped according to the measured cerebral uptake of radioactive substances 16. Since the accumulation of beta-amyloid has an essential role in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease, PET scans can tremendously aid researchers in tracing Alzheimers disease pathology 17. Additionally, advanced methods such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been introduced to assess microstructural alterations in the CNS based on the diffusion of the water molecules. Diffusion parameters, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), represent a measure of microstructural integrity, membrane density and parallel or perpendicular diffusion of the water molecules toward the neuron fibre, respectively 18. Changes in each parameter can suggest a specific alteration in neuronal integrity, that is, decreased FA and higher values of MD might be due to a demyelinating process 19.\nAs mentioned above, evidence shows significant associations between frailty and cognitive impairments. The review by Sousa-Fraguas et al. 20 focused on 12 studies assessing frailty and cognitive function in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD), most of which showed cognitive impairments in PD patients with frailty. Besides, another study conducted by Karanth et al. 21 showed that in the frail and prefrail individuals the global cognitive scores were lower than in the robust ones, while the prevalence of self-reported memory complaint was higher in the frail and prefrail groups compared with controls.\nThe mentioned findings demonstrate the importance of investigating the association between neurodegenerative alterations and frailty. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim to systematically review the neuroimaging studies that assess CNS changes in nondemented frail individuals. By gathering the results from different neuroimaging modalities and understanding the relation between frailty and nondementia cognitive impairments, we can depict the possible implications of frailty in the brain and obtain comprehensive insights about the neuropsychological basis of this condition.",

Regarding the modality of neuroimaging, 16 studies 3, 25-29, 31, 34, 35, 38-40, 42-45 reported MRI results, five 25,28,37,41,44 used DTI, three studies 30,32,33 implemented fMRI and one 36 used PET. The sample size of the studies varied vastly from 40 34 to 1754 28, and their ages ranged from 68.3  6.2 43 to 81.3  8.0 41 in the frail groups and from 60.34  7.28 27 to 78.50 30,40 in the robust groups.

    "Structural MRI Studies": {
      "text": "As illustrated in Table 2, in one of the included MRI studies conducted by Chen et al. 26, no significant difference was detected between at-risk and robust groups regarding total intracranial volume (TIV). However, Sugimoto et al. 3 reported lower intracranial volume (ICV) in the cognitive frailty group, and Kant et al. 31 found a decreased total brain volume (TBV) in frail individuals.\nMost of the reported MRI results were focused on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and white matter volume (WMV) and grey matter volume (GMV). Twelve studies (two case-control and 10 cohort studies) 3, 25-29, 31, 35, 38, 39, 43, 45 reported data on WMHs, five of which 3,25,28,29,31 mentioned higher WMH volumes in the case groups. Sugimoto et al. 3 observed increased WMH volumes in PF and cognitive frailty. Two studies 35,38 stated that higher baseline WMH volumes are associated with the progression of frailty, of which the study by Maltais et al. 35 observed complex-shaped periventricular WMH in the prefrail group. The other studies 34,40,42 did not measure or report WMH. Ducca et al. 28 excluded MCI participants in their study and found nonsignificant differences in WMH in frail individuals with normal cognition. They also found that WMH volumes are correlated with new onset frailty over a 7-year follow-up 28.\nOne of the MRI studies reported lower GMV in frail individuals 31, while two studies 26,42 mentioned no betweengroup differences in GMV. Chen et al. 26 showed that in the at-risk group, GMV was reduced in the cerebellum; hippocampi; middle frontal, precentral and middle occipital gyri; right inferior parietal lobule; left insula and anterior cingulate. Weight loss (a component of frailty) was shown to be linked to a decrease in GMV (specifically in the right postcentral gyrus) as well as an increase in GMV (specifically in the right posterior cingulate). These changes occurred in regions of the brain that are distinct from those associated with frailty 26. Additionally, Li et al. 34 found that GMV in Rolandic, olfactory, rectus, cingulate, hippocampal and parahippocampal and precuneus regions was negatively correlated with functional performance scores. Likewise, Gutiérrez-Zúñiga et al. 44 noted negative correlations between FI and total cortex and thalamic volumes. Furthermore, Nishita et al. noted that slowness and weakness significantly correlated with lower regional GMVs, detailed in Table 2.\nFour studies 27,38,39,43 demonstrated results on cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and only one of them 27 included both lobar and deep CMBs and reported significant results, while the other three did not mention the type of CMBs. The study by Chung et al. 27 showed that the number of CMBs was associated with PF status. Moreover, unlike lobar microbleeds, CMBs in the brain stem were significantly correlated with PF and its severity and were independently associated with the presence of weakness 27. Three studies 27,29,43 investigated the correlation between the number of lacunes and frailty, two of which 27,43 mentioned a significant positive association.",

They found reduced FC between the right angular gyrus and right motor, precuneus, posterior cingulate and sensorimotor cortices 30. Additionally, FC was diminished between the right superior parietal lobule and premotor and anterior cingulate cortices and the frontal and left temporal poles, as well as between the bilateral supramarginal gyrus and left premotor, supplementary motor area (SMA), sensorimotor, right precuneus and bilateral cingulate cortices 30. Lammers et al. 32 reported that FC in the SMA was the lowest in the frail group. Although FC in the pre-SMA was not associated with frailty, it was significantly lower in the individuals with higher MMSE scores. In another study in 2022, Lammers et al. 33 focused on postoperative transitions in frailty stages and observed lower FC between SMA and left parietal cortex in subjects with undesirable outcomes, as well as increased pre-SMA network connectivity in the patients with desirable postoperative transitions (improvements or no transitions). Consistently, they mentioned a significant correlation between higher FC in the pre-SMA network and postoperative improvement.

Avila-Funes et al. 25 reported a decreased FA in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), external capsule (EC) and posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) in the frail group. Furthermore, two 25,37 studies reported an increased MD in their tracts of interest, such as CC, ALIC, EC, PTR, SFOF (superior fronto-occipital fasciculus), posterior and superior corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Gutiérrez-Zúñiga et al. 44 also reported lower FA and higher MD in the CC, superior longitudinal fasciculus and anterior corona radiata on both sides. Regarding AD and RD, both of the studies by Maltais et al. 37 and Avila-Funes et al. 25 observed higher AD and RD values in the ALIC, EC and PTR. The other two DTI studies by Ducca et al. 28 and Tian et al. 41 excluded MCI participants. Ducca et al. 28 did not observe any significant differences regarding the DTI parameters of FA, AD and RD. However, they mentioned that frailty status was associated with lower global MD in their cognitively normal participants 28. On the other hand, Tian et al. 41 noted lower FA in the SFOF and the body of the CC in both frail and prefrail groups and a significant association with higher frailty scores. Furthermore, they observed higher MD in CC, ALIC, EC, PTR, SFOF, posterior and superior corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus 41.

Functional connectivity in the pre-SMA network was found to be significantly cortical region dependent and notably diminished in subjects with higher MMSE scores among the confounding variables. Functional connectivity was found to be associated with GPT performance alone, when correlated brain regions were examined individually; functional robustness and frailty were not influenced.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "As inferred from the findings of this investigation, notable distinctions between frail and robust groups were identified through MRI findings, primarily illustrating an increased count and volumes of WHMs and reduced GMV, compared to the robust group, in some brain regions including the cerebellum, hippocampi, middle frontal gyri, right inferior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, left insula, anterior cingulate and middle occipital gyrus, indicative of vascular changes and brain atrophy, both of which contribute to cognitive impairment and even dementia 46. Also, a significantly lower TIV was reported in one study 31. In future investigations, adjusting for TIV will help to identify the individual GMV changes in frail older adults. This might partly explain the inconsistent results of the different studies. The sole prospective study addressing the correlation between beta-amyloid load in specific brain regions and frailty revealed a positive association between heightened Aβ accumulation in the precuneus cortex, an Alzheimers diseasespecific region, and posterior putamen, suggesting a potential trend toward Alzheimer disease in advanced stages of frailty 36. Additionally, four studies 25,28,37,41 employing DTI underscored the correlation between frailty and the integrity of both grey and WM microstructures, revealing inconsistent outcomes across various investigations, but mostly showing higher MD, lower or unchanged FA and higher or unchanged RD and AD, mostly in corpus callosum, thalamic radiations, corona radiate, internal and external capsule and some association tracts. These important findings in nondemented participants can aid investigators in better understanding the neuroimaging underpinnings of frailty that may lead to cognitive impairment, as well as the implications of frailty on brain health. Also, the shared neuroimaging findings in frailty can be a guide for early detection of preclinical neurological disease such as Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia in individuals with frailty.\nSuch pattern of changes is in line with changes in Alzheimer disease and might indicate predisposition of frail individuals to Alzheimers disease 47,48. Moreover, the investigations conducted by Lammers et al. in 2020 and 2022, comprising two fMRI studies, revealed a discernible decrease in FC associated with the progression of the frailty syndrome in the SMA network but not in the pre-SMA network 32,33. Additionally, Mendez et al. found reduced FC between the right angular gyrus and right motor, precuneus, posterior cingulate and sensorimotor cortices in the frail group 30. Such FC changes in the defaultmode network especially the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex are similar to Alzheimers disease 49. Prior MEG studies reported diminished power and FC in primary sensorimotor, pre-and supplementary motor areas, coupled with augmented connectivity in higher cognitive resting-state networks in individuals exhibiting frailty 30,40.\nAs discussed earlier in this article, PF is a unique systemic clinical syndrome with a biological basis that influences various aspects of the body best described by Fried criteria 1. The correlation of this phenomenon with both the structure and functional changes in the brain, as elucidated in the studies included in this systematic review, is significant and would not have been anticipated without a profound understanding of the underlying biological processes. Recently, the correlation between PF and cognitive decline has gained more attention in medical research 505152. Recent studies have revealed the distinct association between this phenomenon and cognitive dysfunction, even without having overt dementia 51,53. In line with the primary objective of this article, the investigation of neuroimaging changes in nondemented older adults experiencing frailty enables us to clarify the brain structure alterations in PF and, consequently, on the cognitive status of these individuals.\nBy excluding papers that exclusively centred on patients with dementia or those unwilling to eliminate participants who might have dementia, we tried to minimise the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on the brain and obtain a focused perspective on discerning the specific relationship between frailty syndrome and the brain alterations, independent of neurodegenerative diseases or dementia. However, early stages of dementia, such as those observed in patients with MCI, may have minimal impacts on our findings. Nevertheless, as discussed in most of the included studies, the reported findings are common among the majority of participants, with frailty being the only consistent feature among them. In addition, by excluding individuals with dementia, the results of this systematic review may provide more insight on the chronological relationship between frailty and dementia, providing some level of confidence that frailty may be a precursor to dementia, rather than being the result of it.\nJiang et al. conducted a comprehensive study involving more than 483,000 participants, revealing a significant correlation between the degree of frailty and higher levels of total WMH, as well as reduced GMV 54. In a separate study conducted by Zúñiga et al., fMRIs of 347 patients were analysed. The researchers identified 204 edges that had a positive correlation with the FI and 188 edges that exhibited a negative correlation 55. Both of these articles did not exclude patients with dementia. Future study would be enhanced by using stricter patient selection criteria, particularly by eliminating patients with dementia, in order to assure the validity and interpretability of findings.\nVarious articles have proposed two distinct pathophysiological pathways to explain the observed brain damage in the frail older adults. The observations in the frail population predominantly propose a shared foundational origin for these phenomena-systemic vascular damage. While the precise role of vascular diseases in frailty syndrome remains less established, some evidence in the literature suggests a potential cause-andeffect relationship between the two. Avila-Funes et al. identified that disturbances in the structure of carotid arteries were more prevalent in frail individuals compared to nonfrail counterparts 56. Newman et al. discovered that, among those without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the extent of underlying CVD, as measured by carotid ultrasound and ankle-arm index, along with left ventricular hypertrophy assessed through ECG and echocardiography, exhibited a correlation with frailty 57. Besides, some new studies had shown a positive relationship between retinal microvascular damages and PF 58,59. Consistent with this, the predominant MRI finding in the included studies appears to be an elevation in both the number and size of WMHs within frail groups, findings in line with vascular pathology 60. Cortical brain infarcts, as linked with PF as shown by Kant et al. 31, serve as an MRI marker of large vessel disease and exhibit an association with cognitive decline 61. All these pieces of evidence collectively suggest a common basis between PF and neurological damage, seemingly rooted in vascular physiopathology. Prior research indicates a distinct association between different presentations of vascular disorders and dementia 62,63. These manifestations have a shared characteristic in the form of small blood vessel alterations, indicating a connection between frailty and dementia. To comprehensively evaluate these findings, further investigations with a larger number of participants are warranted.\nAnother suggested pathway explores the influence of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors in the frailty syndrome on the brain 64,65. Two recent studies establish a correlation between higher proinflammatory markers and an elevated risk of frailty and cognitive frailty 66,67. The presence of these factors as a link between this syndrome and neuroimaging changes necessitates further comprehensive investigations in this domain.\nSuch pathophysiological pathways contribute to cognitive impairment, as well as vascular and Alzheimer dementia. Given the shared neuroimaging findings with Alzheimers disease, such as brain atrophy especially in the hippocampus and precuneus cortex, higher WMHs and CMBs, WM microstructural changes in similar tracts as Alzheimers disease, reduced FC in DMN and importantly higher amyloid deposition in the precuneus cortex, it can be inferred that frailty is a preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer disease. Also, the vascular compromise, as shown by higher WMHs, is significant in frailty and can further contribute to cognitive impairment and even progression to dementia 68.\nOur findings contribute to the understanding of frailty in nondemented individuals by emphasizing its multifaceted nature and the significance of various diagnostic criteria, such as gait speed and grip strength. These measures not only serve as indicators of physical health but may also correlate with neuroimaging findings related to cognitive function and overall brain health. Future research should further investigate the intricate relationships between neuroimaging results and frailty to enhance diagnostic and intervention strategies.\nWe had several limitations in our systematic review which should be considered in order to make a fair conclusion based on the results. Although most of the included studies recruited Fried criteria as their main frailty measurement, diversity in assessment tools might have affected the categorization of participants and their frailty stage due to the focus of the measurement tool on either cognitive of physical aspects of the condition. Besides, the small number of fMRI and PET studies makes it challenging to make a proper conclusion based on their results. Therefore, more multimodal neuroimaging studies and a uniform assessment tool for frailty should be conducted to clarify the unknown aspects of neurophysiological changes in nondemented frailty. Also, to determine whether or not frailty can be a risk factor or precursor for developing Alzheimer dementia, longitudinal studies especially with amyloid PET scans are warranted. Besides, we included studies with nondemented frail participants in this systematic review. However, except for two studies 28,41, the majority of included studies did not exclude MCI participants 3, 25-27, 29-40, 42-45. This could be due to the fact that frailty is a risk factor for MCI and is prevalent among MCI cases 52. As MCI could potentially affect the neuroimaging findings in the study participants 3, 25-27, 29-40, 42-45, we strongly recommend the future studies to either exclude MCI participants or assess imaging findings separately in nondemented frail individuals with MCI and those who are cognitively normal, to be able to provide a more specific interpretation on the neuroimaging correlates of frailty in cognitively normal individuals.\nTo conclude, significant neuroimaging distinctions between frail and robust individuals were noted, emphasizing vascular changes in brain tissue, altered beta-amyloid accumulation and grey and WM microstructure changes. The correlation between PF and cognitive decline is earlier discussed in earlier studies, even without overt dementia. Systematic vascular damage and inflammatoryoxidative stress are two common pathophysiological pathways suggesting a link between PF and neurological damage. The study underscores the importance of understanding both the brain structure and function of PF, offering insights into potential pathways for cognitive decline in nondemented older adults.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is transition phase between cognitive decline and dementia. The current study aims to investigate altered metabolic pattern in plasma of MCI for potential biomarkers. MCI (N  50) and healthy controls (HC, N  50) age group 55-75 years were screened based on Mini Mental State Examination Test (MMSE) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI imaging). The MMSE score of MCI was significantly lower (25.74  1.83) compared to healthy control subjects (29  1). The MCI patients exhibit significant changes in white matter integrity in the right frontal lobe, right temporal lobe, left frontal lobe, forcep major, fornix, corpus callosum. Further, the plasma samples of twenty seven MCI patients (N  27) and twenty HC subjects (N  20; having no significant differences in any demographics) were analyzed using 1 H NMR based metabolomics approach. Consistent with many previous reports, the levels of several plasma metabolites were found to be elevated in MCI patients compared to healthy controls. Further univariate and multivariate ROC curve analyses provided three plasma metabolites as a diagnostic panel of biomarker for MCI; which are lysine, glycine, and glutamine. Overall, the results of this study will help to improve the diagnostic and prognostic strategies of MCI in addition to improving our understanding about disease pathogenesis. We believe that the over-nutritional metabolic phenotype of MCI needs to be targeted for developing future dietary interventions so that the progression of MCI can be limited.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease represents the most common neurodegenerative disease prevalent worldwide, accounting for 60 to 70 of progressive cognitive impairment in elderly patients. The transition state between normal aging and mild Alzheimers disease is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and therefore has become a focal point for clinical research (Petersen et al. 2001). The conversion rate of MCI to AD dementia is 10-15 per year and the main symptom of AD dementia is memory impairment that is comparatively less to that expected for their age (Petersen et al. 2001). The diagnosis of MCI includes a neurological examination, mental status test and brain imaging (Barthel et al. 2011). The challenges in the development of biomarkers for MCI are its long asymptomatic stage and variability in clinical features, genetic polymorphism and molecular etiologies (e.g. presenilin-1 (PS-1), presenilin-2 (PS-2), APP mutation, apolipoprotein E (APOE) and sporadic MCI (Irizarry 2004). The alteration of white matter integrity in MCI patients through diffusion tensor imaging provided significant pieces of evidence about anatomical changes occurring during the asymptomatic stage of MCI (Stebbins and Murphy 2009). Neuroimaging technique is used as a prospective tool for early detection of cognitive impairment before conversion to clinical MCI but it has limitations on cost-effectiveness and accessibility by larger population (Kantarci et al. 2001). Therefore, obtaining blood samples is easy and exploration of the biomarker in serumplasma becomes essentially significant.\nThe current study was undertaken by using NMR based plasma metabolomics approach to identify the reliable diagnostic panel of biomarkers for early detection of mild cognitive impaired subjects at high risk of Alzheimers disease. Recent past has witnessed a plethora of metabolomics studies carried out on Alzheimers patients belonging to different populations and revealed that metabolic changes in biofluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasmaserum. The studies suggest that blood plasma serum metabolic profiles have the potential to aid early diagnosis of MCI and its clinical management. NMR combined with multivariate statistical analysis is currently the method of choice for rapid metabolomics analysis of biofluids (Guleria et al. 2018). Various such metabolomics studies have already been carried out in recent past to investigate plasma metabolic changes associated with MCI (Oskouie et al. 2018). To be mentioned here is that most of these plasmaserum-based metabolomics studies have been performed in Eastern, Japanese, Korean and European populations (Oskouie et al. 2018). However, there is still no such data regarding plasma metabolic disturbances associated with MCI and their usefulness in MCI detection in Indian populations. Further, NMR based metabolomics studies were all based on the comparison of normalized spectral features i.e. integrated spectral bins normalized w.r.t. the total spectral intensity. The present study has been designed to establish the plasma metabolic disturbances associated with MCI in north Indian and to further evaluate its diagnostic utility.",

      "text": "The plasma samples were prepared and analyzed on 800 MHz NMR following the procedure as described previously (Guleria et al. 2018, Guleria et al. 2016). Briefly, the 1D 1 H CPMG NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance-III NMR Spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at 800.12 MHz frequency, using the standard CPMG spin-echo pulse sequence (cpmgpr1d) with water pre-saturation to suppress the water signal and a total spin-spin relaxation delay of 5 s was used. In total, 128 transients were recorded into 64 K data points over a spectral width of 20 ppm, resulting in an acquisition time per scan of 15 min. All spectra were phased manually, and baseline corrected using PROCESSOR module of commercial software CHENOMX (v8.4, Edmonton, Canada). All spectra were calibrated w.r.t. formate δ (8.43) ppm (Kumar et al. 2020, Xu et al. 2011) (used here as an internal reference and concentration set to 10 micromolar i.e. nearly close to the detection limit of 800 MHz NMR spectrometer). The spectral region δ (0.6-8.6) ppm was segmented into bins of 0.02 ppm. To remove the variability arising from water suppression, the spectral region δ(4.4 to 5.0) ppm attenuated because of residual water signal was discarded prior to binning. Each spectral bin was normalized to the total intensity sum of the spectral bins included for the analysis. The resulted data matrix has been referred here as normalized spectral bins (or features). Characteristic peaks of various metabolites were identified based on comparisons with the 800 MHz database library of Chenomx NMR suite and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB: http:www.hmdb.ca). The phase and baseline corrected spectra were further analyzed using PROFILER-Module of CHENOMX and concentrations of 31 plasma metabolites were explicitly measured: 3-Hydroxybutyrate (3HB), acetone, alanine, aspartate, betaine, choline, citrate, creatine, creatinine, glucose, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, isoleucine, lactate, leucine, lysine, mannose, methionine, dimethylglycine (DMG), phenylalanine, proline, pyruvate, serine, succinate, threonine, tyrosine, urea, valine, Glycerophosphocholine (GPCh) and Histidine. The resulted concentrations were then used to estimate other relevant ratios of circulatory metabolites such as Phenylalanine-to-Tyrosine ratio (PTR); Histidine-to-Tyrosine ratio (HTR); Branchedchain amino acid to Tyrosine ratio (BTR; estimated as (LeucineIsoleucineValine)Tyr; this is also referred as Fischer ratio and is an indicative of hepatic function impairment) (Charlton 2006, Tajiri andShimizu 2013) Glutamate-to-Glutamine ratio (EQR); and Lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR). To be mentioned here is that the concentrations of plasma metabolites have been reported here in micromolar except for glucose and lactate for which the concentrations have been reported in millimolar. These concentrations have been estimated w.r.t. formate setting its concentration in each case to 10 micromolar.",

      "text": "Principal component analysis (PCA, un-supervised) and supervised Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed employing free web-based multivariate analysis tool named Metaboanalyst (v4.0) (Chong et al. 2019, Chong et al. 2018). Multivariate analysis was applied to both (a) CPMG data matrix containing normalized spectral bins and (b) concentration profiles estimated for 31 plasma metabolites following the steps described previously (Guleria et al. 2016, Serkova andNiemann 2006). Additionally, we also involved some relevant metabolic ratios to evaluate their discriminatory potential based on the different multivariate statistical analysis models. Prior to multivariate analysis, the normalized spectral bins were scaled using Pareto scaling. PCA, was used to detect intrinsic clusters and outliers within the data set, was followed by PLS-DA to maximize class discrimination (Guleria et al. 2018). As PLS-DA inclines to over fit the data and, therefore, the model needs to be strictly validated to see whether the separation is statistically significant or is due to random noise. To avoid the over-fitting of the PLS-DA model, 10-fold cross-validation algorithm -which helps to evaluate 100 classification accuracy using the top 5 latent variables, was used (Chong et al. 2019, Guleria et al. 2018). The PLS-DA models were cross-validated by permutation analysis (100 times), and the resulting crossvalidation parameters R2 and Q2 were used to assess the quality of the PLS-DA models i.e. the goodness-of-fit parameter by R2 (also referred to as explained variance) and the goodness of prediction parameter by Q2 (or the predictive capability of the model). The PLS-DA model was further used to identify the metabolites responsible for the discrimination based on their higher variable influence on projection (VIP) scores (also known as variable importance on projection scores). The significant differences in metabolite levels were detected by Mann-Whitney U test (considering unequal group variance and the resulted p values are adjusted to minimize false discovery rate). Then, to identify the potential biomarkers associated with MCI disease, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using Biomarker Analysis module of the MetaboAnalyst (v4.0) software (Chong et al. 2019, Chong et al. 2018). Multivariate ROC curve exploratory analysis was used to identify the promising biomarkers with high sensitivity and high specificity. The ROC curves were generated using Monte-Carlo cross validation (MCCV) algorithm and PLS-DA clustering to evaluate the feature importance of the selected metabolites. The correlation analysis between key metabolic profiles and clinically evaluated mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was performed using Spearman r (r) correlation method. For both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, the level of statistical significance was set at p  0.05. Continuous variables were expressed as the mean  SD and categorical variables as percentage.",

    "Plasma metabolic disturbances associated with MCI": {
      "text": "Figure 1 compares the cumulative 1D 1 H CPMG NMR spectra of plasma samples obtained from MCI and HC groups. The 1 H NMR signals assigned for various metabolites are also annotated in Fig. 1. As evident, the plasma spectra showed signals mainly from (a) lipid and membrane metabolites such as Fatty acids (FAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), choline, glycerophosphocholine (GPCh), (b) lipoproteins e.g. lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), (c) amino acids (e.g. glycine, alanine, valine, proline, threonine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, etc.), (d) energy metabolites e.g. citrate, pyruvate, glucose, lactate, creatine, creatinine and (e) some other metabolites like acetate, acetoacetate, and Nacetyl-glycoproteins (NAG). Visual inspection of cumulative plasma spectra from MCI and HC subjects (Fig. 1) suggested differences in their lipoprotein profiles and the relative amount of some metabolites (e.g. glucose, lactate, alanine, histidine, etc.). However, confirmation of these and other subtle differences requires the application of multivariate statistical analysis.\nFigure 2a shows the scores plot derived from the PLS-DA analysis of normalized spectral features. A trend for clustering of MCI and HC samples was clearly seen, but, no evident separation between MCI and HC samples was observed and further the PLS-DA model validation parameters (R2 and Q2) were also not significantly higher (R2 0.53, Q2 0.02, Fig. 2b) suggesting the normalized spectral features between two groups are not distinctively different. The VIP score plot derived from PLS-DA analysis (Fig. 2c) revealed that spectral bins belonging to LDL, VLDL, PUFA, urea, glucose and lactate are exhibiting VIP score value 1.0 and may have discriminatory potential. However, statistical analysis revealed that only plasma levels of urea are significantly decreased in MCI compared to HC with p value 0.05 (Fig. 2d). Important to be noticed in Fig. 2c is that there is a higher degree of metabolic redundancy and the resonances of lactate, glucose and lipid metabolites were dominating the VIP score plot (Fig. 2c). As the MCI patients involved in our study were mostly above 50 years of age, the corresponding normal healthy control group was very heterogeneous in terms of metabolic profiles of lipid and membrane metabolites including lowvery-low density lipoproteins. As these metabolites contribute significantly in the total spectral intensity of 1D 1 H CPMG NMR spectrum; thus comparison based on normalized spectral features may lead to ambiguous or contradictory results, particularly, when the difference in the metabolic concentration is very small compared to the total spectral intensity. In order to rule out any such ambiguities due to spectral normalization, the concentrations of plasma metabolites were explicitly measured concerning formate as described in Materials and Method section. The resulted concentration profiles and five metabolic ratios (PTR, HTR, EQR, BTR and LPR) were further compared between the study groups using multivariate PLS-DA method.\nAlthough PCA score plots were generated and revealed poor discrimination among the two groups (results not shown), PLS-DA model-based discriminatory analysis showed the unbiased clustering and unsupervised separation among the 2 groups (Fig. 3a). The MCI and HC groups were clearly separated with the PLS-DA score plot model. Further, the metabolites of discriminatory potential were identified based on VIP score plot analysis (Fig. 3c). The VIP score plot analysis in combination with univariate statistical analysis (Fig. 3d) revealed that most of the metabolic changes of discriminatory potential are statistically significant as well except urea which are found to be statistically different based on the multivariate statistical analysis performed with normalized spectral features (Fig. 2d). Compared to HC group, the circulatory levels of majority of metabolites were found to be increased in the plasma samples of MCI patients except for glutamate to glutamine ratio (EQR), the plasma levels of which were found to be decreased in MCI patients compared to HC.\nAs the present study also aims to test the utility of plasma based metabolic profiles in the diagnostic screening of MCI patients. Therefore, ROC curve analysis was performed further to evaluate the diagnostic potential of discriminatory metabolites between MCI and HC groups. Considering AUC value0.8 and p value0.05 as the criterion for diagnostic potential; nine metabolic entities (lysine, betaine, histidine, glycine, glutamine, GPC, tyrosine, leucine and isoleucine) have been identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers of MCI (Fig. 4a-4i, Table 3). Among nine metabolites, lysine showed highest discriminatory potential with area under the ROC curve (AUC) value equal to 0.88 (with 95 CI  0.76-0.96) and isoleucine showed lowest AUC value equal to 0.80 (with 95 CI  0.65-0.92). Next, we also attempted to improve the prediction using multivariate ROC curve exploratory analysis. First, we attempted to achieve higher AUC value generating ROC curve based on these 9 metabolic biomarker features (Fig. 4j), but, that does not improved the AUC value (estimated to be 0.85 with 95 CI  0.7-0.92). Next, a multivariate ROC curve analysis was performed involving a combination of more than one discriminatory metabolite selected via logistic regression analysis (the results are presented in ESM, Fig. S2). An overview of all ROC curves (created from six different biomarker models using different number of features) is shown in Fig. 4k. As evident, the highest AUC value of 0.87 (with 95 CI: 0.693-0.985) was obtained for 3rd biomarker model involving five top metabolites (glutamine, alanine, glycine, proline and lysine; selected frequency  0.8). Among all the six biomarker models, the 3rd biomarker model also showed the highest predictive accuracy of 79.5 as evident from ESM, Fig. S2b (showing predictive accuracies of different biomarker models involving different number of features).\nFig. 3 A. The 2D PLS-DA score plot derived from PLS-DA analysis of using 36 plasma metabolic features (31 metabolic entities and five metabolic ratios as per Table 1) showing an evident separation of MCI group (in green) from HC group (in red). The shaded or semi-transparent areas represent the 95 confidence regions of each group as depicted by their respective colors. Considering metabolites of discriminatory potential common both in univariate (Fig. 4) and multivariate ROC analysis models, the diagnostic panel of biomarkers proposed here is lysine, glycine and glutamine. Important, to be mentioned here is that none of the multivariate models of binary discrimination between MCI and HC showed the AUC value (highest The concentrations of various circulatory metabolites are estimated in CHENOMX using formate as an internal reference and its concentration for each spectrum was set equal to 10 μM.  The concentrations of all metabolites are reported in micromolar (μM) except for lactate and glucose for which the concentrations are reported in millimolar. Abbreviations used: NS: Non-significant; GpCh: Glycerophosphocholine; HTR: Histidine-to-Tyrosine ratio; BTR: Branched-chain amino acid to Tyrosine ratio (evaluated as: (LeucineIsoleucineValine)Tyr); PTR: Phenylalanine-to-Tyrosine ratio; EQR: Glutamate-to-Glutamine ratio; and LPR: Lactate-to-pyruvate ratio value 0.876; and 95 CI  0.66-0.976) higher than that of lysine (for which AUC value is equal to 0.878 and 95 CI  0.76-0.96). We further attempted to evaluate if the diagnostic potential of lysine can be improved further through adding metabolic features of diagnostic potential (shown in Fig. 4 i.e. betaine, histidine, glycine, glutamine, GPC, tyrosine, leucine and isoleucine). The results summarized in ESM, Fig. S3 clearly suggested that the diagnostic potential of lysine particularly improves further when the ROC analysis is performed in combination with histidine and this combination resulted into AUROC value equal to 0.901 (with 95 CI  0.72-1.0). This small exercise will serve as a guiding attribute for future clinical metabolomics studies aiming to search for different combinations of metabolic features for more reliable and robust diagnostic screening, particularly, for differentiating moderate and severe cases of MCI compared to normal healthy controls (HCs).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Compared to HC, the circulatory levels of LDL and other lipid entities were found to be decreased, but, the changes were statistically not significant. The decreased lipid levels were found to be well consistent to previous study (He et al. 2016) which also reported no significant difference in circulatory LDL levels between MCI patients and cognitively normal controls: reported LDL-C for MCI  118.62  34.31, NC  120.22  36.41, p value  0.742). The study further reported that there is no association between plasma LDL level and the risk of MCI (and further adjustment for demographics, vascular disorders did not change this relation) (He et al. 2016). Among the 36 selected plasma metabolites, twenty eight (28) were significantly altered in MCI patients compared with the normal controls. Compared to HC, the MCI patients were characterized by increased levels of the majority of circulatory metabolites. These metabolic disturbances in MCI suggested significant changes in amino acid metabolism (indicative of proteolysis), energy metabolism (dampened glycolysis), ketogenesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism and urea cycle disorder (Fig. 4L). The majority of metabolic changes observed in this study were well consistent with previous plasma-based metabolomics studies (Salek et al. 2010, Serkova and Niemann 2006, Shea et al. 2012, Tajiri and Shimizu 2013, Trushina et al. 2013, Trygg and Wold 2002, Von Arnim et al. 2010) though some discrepancies were observed as well as evident from Table 3. The observed discrepancies may be attributed to the fact that the present study involved concentration profiling for the first time using formate as an internal reference.\nCompared to HC, the increased plasma levels of glucose in MCI patients were indicative of hyperglycaemic status and this was found to be well consistent with previous reports showing association of diabetes status or poor glycemic control, and longer diabetes duration with worse cognitive outcomes (Rawlings et al. 2019, Cerasuolo andIzzo 2017).\nCompared to HC, the increased plasma levels of various amino acids in MCI might be related to disturbed proteolysis and amino acid metabolism in MCI patients. Previous studies have revealed that the indicators of over-nutrition are linked to both clinical dementia and Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as to overall mortality (Fielding et al. 2013). Different epidemiological studies also suggest that human nutrition and lifestyle factors can modify the risk of late-onset dementia (Shea et al. 2012). For example, routine consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, unsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 rich oils is associated with decreased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its conversion to AD (Von Arnim et al. 2010, Xu et al. 2011) whereas overweight in midlife has been associated with an increased risk for dementia in late life (Xu et al. 2011). The elevated levels of the majority of circulatory metabolites therefore clearly suggest that MCI patients have the over-nutritional metabolic phenotype. Recent study reported that the circulatory levels of glutamate and glutamine are elevated in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) of patients with probable Alzheimers Disease and Depression (Madeira et al. 2018). In present study, we also observed that the plasma levels of glutamate and glutamine in MCI patients are elevated and this could be the reflection of metabolic change present in CSF. It is reported that the impaired memory and learning in AD involve the dysfunction neurotransmission of glutamate, the agonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain (Chang et al. 2020). Currently, memantine (NMDAR antagonist) is one of the therapeutic drugs used for the treatment of AD (Scheltens et al. 2016). Though it has been developed on the basis of the hypothesis of NMDAR overactivation in moderate-severe AD (Reisberg et al. 2003), however, it shows limited efficacy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD (Schneider et al. 2011). Glutamate is the most abundant free amino acid in the brain and has excitatory effects on nerve cells. However, the higher glutamate levels can excite cells t o t h e i r d e a t h i n a p r o c e s s n o w r e f e r r e d t o a s excitotoxicity. Within brain cells, the glutamate is converted to inert glutamine and shuttled back to excitatory nerve terminals. The elevated levels glutamine has been reported to be associated with dementia risk (van der Lee et al. 2018). In addition to glutamine, the multivariate ROC analysis also shows the presence of glutamate in the top six important metabolites based on their frequency selection during cross-validation (See ESM, Fig. S2). These changes in corroboration with decreased extracellular glutamate to glutamine ratio (EQR) in MCI might be related to impaired glutamate-glutamine cycling which in turn could result in a self-perpetuating neuronal death cascade mediated by glutamate as reported previously (Walton and Dodd 2007). This was further supported by the negative correlation of glutamine (r  -0.38; p value  0.05) and positive correlation of EQR (r  0.55; p value  0.0032) found with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score evaluated for the MCI patients (Table 4).\nCompared to HC, the circulatory levels of lysine were significantly increased in MCI patients and the highest AUC value of 0.876 (with 95 CI  0.66-0.976) further demonstrated its diagnostic potential. The elevated levels of lysine were found well consistent with previous report (Trushina et al. 2013), however, the lack of its correlation with MMSE score in north Indian population, suggested that lysine metabolic profiling does not have prognostic utility.",

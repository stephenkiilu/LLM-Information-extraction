    "abstract": "Background: Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are a major cause of stroke and dementia. Yet, specific treatment strategies are lacking in part because of a limited understanding of the underlying disease processes. There is therefore an urgent need to study SVDs at their core, the small vessels themselves. Objective: This paper presents the rationale and design of the ZOOMSVDs study, which aims to establish measures of cerebral small vessel dysfunction on 7T MRI as novel disease markers of SVDs. Methods: ZOOMSVDs is a prospective observational cohort study with two years follow-up. ZOOMSVDs recruits participants with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL, N  20), sporadic SVDs ( N  60), and healthy controls ( N  40). Participants undergo 7T brain MRI to assess different aspects of small vessel function including small vessel reactivity, cerebral perforating artery flow, and pulsatility. Extensive work-up at baseline and follow-up further includes clinical and neuropsychological assessment as well as 3T brain MRI to assess conventional SVD imaging markers. Measures of small vessel dysfunction are compared between patients and controls, and related to the severity of clinical and conventional MRI manifestations of SVDs. Discussion: ZOOMSVDs will deliver novel markers of cerebral small vessel function in patients with monogenic and sporadic forms of SVDs, and establish their relation with disease burden and progression. These small vessel markers can support etiological studies in SVDs and may serve as surrogate outcome measures in future clinical trials to show target engagement of drugs directed at the small vessels.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) affect small arteries, capillaries and small veins in the brain 1 . SVDs account for most hemorrhagic strokes, a quarter of ischemic strokes, and at least 40 of dementia cases, alone or in combination with neurodegenerative pathology 1 . Roughly 70 of 65-year-old individuals and almost all 90-year-olds exhibit manifestations of SVDs on brain imaging 2 . Despite this profound impact, there is no specific treatment for SVDs with proven efficacy. Current management is limited to treatment of risk factors, foremost hypertension, which is clearly of fundamental importance, but is not sufficient to halt SVDs and their consequences. Better insight into the mechanisms underlying SVDs is urgently needed to support the development of targeted treatments.\nOver the years there has been major progress in the development of SVD biomarkers. These include visible manifestations on MRI (i.e. lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces 3 ), more subtle microstructural white matter changes (measured with diffusion tensor imaging 456 ) and blood-based biomarkers of neuro-axonal damage (serum neurofilament light 7 ). All of these biomarkers primarily reflect SVDs-related parenchymal injury. This injury relates to important functional outcomes, in particular cognitive decline and dementia, but is essentially a downstream consequence of a disease that originates in the small cerebral vessels. In these vessels, SVDs manifest as loss of smooth muscle cells, fibrinoid necrosis, narrowing of the lumen, and thickening of the vessel wall 1 , 8 . This impacts vessel function, as observed in pial and parenchymal arteries in experimental animal models of both hereditary and sporadic forms of SVDs 9 , 10 . Emerging techniques at 7T MRI provide noninvasive measures of cerebral small vessel function in humans 11 . These measures allow SVDs to be studied at their core, the small vessels themselves, and have important potential as biomarker of SVDs to help unravel the pathophysiology and serve as surrogate outcome measures in treatment studies.\nThis paper presents the rationale and design of ZOOMSVDs, part of the SVDstarget research program (see textbox). ZOOMSVDs explores (1) which aspects of small vessel function on 7T brain MRI are affected in patients with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and in patients with symptomatic sporadic SVD, and (2) how small vessel function relates to SVD severity at baseline and disease progression after two years.\nSVDstarget (Small vessel diseases in a mechanistic perspective: Targets for Intervention -Affected pathways and mechanistic exploitation for prevention of stroke and dementia) ( www.svds-at-target.eu ). The program is funded by Horizon 2020 and includes three clinical studies: ZOOMSVDs (current paper), INVESTIGATE-SVDs, and TREAT-SVDs.

These measures assess flow in the perforating arteries in a 2D slice at the level of the basal ganglia and semioval centre. The measures are influenced by the state of the perforating arteries, but also by up-and downstream flow regulation. 2 Small vessel reactivity in the visual cortex in response to a visual stimulus (i.e. neurovascular coupling) is assessed by means of the BOLD hemodynamic response. This is an ROI based measure in the visual cortex that assesses the parenchymal microvasculature. Neuronal activation triggers neurovascular coupling and induces vasodilation through the capillaries in the feeding pre-cappilary, parenchymal and penetrating arterioles to increase blood flow to the activated visual cortex 30 . 3 Whole-brain small vessel reactivity (cerebrovascular reactivity) to a hypercapnic stimulus (i.e. breathing 6 CO 2 in air) is measured with the BOLD response. This is a whole-brain measure from which more specific ROIs can be defined to assess the local parenchymal microvasculature. The hypercapnic stimulus causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cells at the level of the arterioles, thereby causing direct small vessel vasodilation 31 .\nThe three protocols are complementary as they assess different small vessel populations, in different ROIs, either at rest or during stimulation with two different types of stimuli. The next three paragraphs describe the methods of these three 7T MRI protocols.",

Slices are placed at the level of the basal ganglia and the semioval centre using predefined anatomical landmarks 27 . A peripheral pulse unit is used for retrospective cardiac gating ( Table 5 summarizes technical details). For post-processing, the ROI in the basal ganglia slice is manually delineated from the 2D phasecontrast magnitude image. The ROI in the semioval centre slice is generated using an automatically delineated 2D white matter mask from a T1-weighted scan. The outside border of this mask (80 pixels  14 mm) is excluded to be robust to subject motion between the acquisition of the T1-weighted and the 2D phase-contrast scan, which could lead to unsolicited inclusion of cortical vessels located in sulci. In these ROIs, perforating artery detection is performed with a previously developed method which automatically excludes perforating arteries in ghosting artefacts in the semioval centre 32 and perforating arteries in the basal ganglia that are oriented non-perpendicularly to the scanning plane. Additionally, apparent perforating arteries that are located within a 1.2 mm radius from each other are excluded, as these mostly are false detections of larger and non-perpendicular vessels. Subsequently, the perforating artery flow is assessed per subject as in earlier work 27 , 29 , 33 . The protocol is visually summarized in Fig. 1 .\nOutcome measures, assessed separately for the basal ganglia and the semioval centre, are cerebral perforating artery density (number of perforating arteriescm 2 ), mean blood flow velocity (the averaged mean velocity per subject in cms) and flow pulsatility index (PI).

Then PI is calculated per subject as\nwhere V max , V min and V mean are the maximum, minimum and mean of the normalized and averaged blood flow velocity over the cardiac cycle 27 , 28 .

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "ZOOMSVDs will provide novel functional biomarkers of SVDs at the level of the small vessels themselves. We will assess cerebral perforating artery flow, and vascular reactivity to a visual and a hypercapnic stimulus with 7T MRI in patients with hereditary (i.e. CADASIL) and sporadic SVDs and controls. The different protocols in ZOOMSVDs capture complementary aspects of small vessel function; in different types of small vessels, in different ROIs, both at rest and during stimulation with two different types of stimuli. We will determine which aspects of small vessel function are affected by SVDs and how this relates to disease severity and progression.\nThe small vessel functional measures in ZOOMSVDs were chosen based on their relevance for SVDs and earlier research. We assess blood flow velocity and pulsatility index in perforating arteries in the basal ganglia and semioval centre. These perforating arteries are of particular interest given that, in SVDs, these are affected by arteriolosclerosis. We interpret pulsatility index as a measure of vascular stiffness, but the measure is also influenced by up-and downstream cerebral blood flow, pulse pressure and autoregulation. In earlier explorative work, we reported higher pulsatility in perforating arteries of patients with stroke attributable to SVD compared with controls, but similar blood flow velocity 28 . In ZOOMSVDs, we will expand these observations in larger cohorts of highly phenotyped patients, including patients with CADASIL as a prototypic condition of pure and relatively severe SVD. In addition, we assess small vessel reactivity through neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex. Earlier studies with similar paradigms on 3T MRI have observed decreased vascular reactivity in response to a visual stimulus in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 3738394041 . In ZOOMSVDs, we study CADASIL and sporadic SVDs that show largely subcortical lesions, but might have abnormal cortical small vessel reactivity as well. The strength of 7T MRI is that we will be able to carefully isolate the signal from the parenchyma, derived from changes in blood oxygen levels in the local capillaries and draining venules, in reponse to upstream arteriolar dilation. It is important to realize that, in order to represent neurovascular coupling and small vessel function, neuronal activation to the visual stimulus should be unaffected. We expect neuronal activation to be normal in CADASIL and sporadic SVD, as an earlier study reported normal cortical electrical potentials to a visual stimulus in patients with CADASIL and CAA 39 . Lastly, we assess small vessel reactivity with a hypercapnic stimulus that causes vasodilation in the arterioles 31 . Compared with the visual stimulus, the hypercapnic stimulus provides a whole-brain (rather than only cortical) measure of small vessel reactivity, that does not involve neurovascular coupling. Earlier studies used this paradigm on 3T MRI and observed that lower vascular reactivity was related to a higher burden of parenchymal SVD lesions in sporadic 42 and monogenic SVD 43 . In ZOOMSVDs, we can capitalize on the high-resolution signal of 7T MRI to study local small vessel function, for example at the exact location of parenchymal lesions.\nA strength of the ZOOMSVDs study is that we will assess small vessel disease at its core, in the small vessels. By using three complementary measures across different brain regions we will be able to evaluate different aspects of small vessel function in different vessel subpopulations. By studying both monogenic and sporadic SVDs, we expect to find both shared and differential features of different forms of SVDs. Although downstream consequences of CADASIL and sporadic SVDs in the parenchyma show important similarities, there clearly are differences in the molecular and cellular pathways that affect the small vessels, likely with different signatures of vessel (dys)function. Moreover, in sporadic SVDs, vascular risk factors may differentially affect different vessel populations. Hypertension, for example, is known to most strongly affect the perforating arteries at the base of the brain, which are directly exposed to high pressure from the large arteries 44 . Finally, functional changes in different vessel populations may differentially affect the brain parenchyma. Therefore ZOOMSVDs will also assess the interrelation between the nature of small vessel dysfunction and patterns of injury, also in longitudinal analyses. A limitation of ZOOMSVDs is that, given the extensive protocol, there will likely be a relative overrepresentation of patients that are less affected (i.e. in earlier disease stages). Moreover, in order not to make the protocol too demanding, we prioritized detailed assessment of the primary parameters of interest. Consequently, some of the secondary clinical outcome measures are only assessed with screening tests with restricted sensitivity (e.g. assessment of motor performance and depression). Finally, 3T MRIs and their post-processing were performed at different centres for patients with CADASIL and sporadic SVDs. Importantly, the scans of the respective controls were always acquired on the same scanners as the patients. Although differences in scan acquisition and analysis may give rise to small differences in for example brain volume measurements, this should not impact the outcome of the study, because all primary analyses involving 3T parenchymal injury markers will be done within each patient group in comparison to their respective controls. ZOOMSVDs will characterize which small vessel function measures are affected in patients with CADASIL and sporadic SVDs compared with controls. Within the patient groups, we will establish which functional measures relate to disease severity (e.g. lesion burden and cognitive functioning). These markers could be well-suited to assist future etiological studies. In addition, the reversible nature of small vessel function makes the measures possibly potent outcome markers in intervention studies on candidate therapies that target the small vessels, thereby ultimately supporting the development of eagerly needed SVD treatment.",

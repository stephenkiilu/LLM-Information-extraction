    "abstract": "To investigate dopamine D2D3 receptor availability following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their relationship to the presence of DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and patterns of axonal injury. Methods: Twelve moderate-severe TBI patients and 26 controls were imaged using  11 CPHNO positron emission tomography (PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TBI patients and a second group of 32 controls also underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment. Patients included six with post-injury MDD (TBI-MDD) and six without (TBI-NON). Non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND )  11 C PHNO values were used to index D2D3 receptor availability, and were calculated using a reference region procedure. Differences in BP ND were examined using voxelwise and region-of-interest analyses. White matter microstructure integrity, quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA), was assessed and correlated with BP ND . Results: Lower  11 CPHNO BP ND was found in the caudate across all TBI patients when compared to controls. Lower  11 CPHNO BP ND was observed in the caudate of TBI-MDD patients and increased  11 CPHNO BP ND in the Amygdala of TBI-NON patients compared to controls. There were no significant differences in  11 CPHNO BP ND between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patients. Furthermore, DTI provided evidence of axonal injury following TBI. The uncinate fasciculus and cingulum had abnormally low FA, with the uncinate particularly affected in TBI-MDD patients. Caudate  11 CPHNO BP ND correlated with FA within the nigro-caudate tract. Conclusions:  11 CPHNO BP ND is abnormal following TBI, which indicates post-traumatic changes in D2D3 receptors. Patterns of  11 CPHNO BP ND seen in patients with and without MDD suggest that further research would be beneficial to determine whether the use of dopaminergic treatment might be effective in the treatment of post-traumatic depression.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to cognitive and psychiatric problems (Whitnall et al., 2006;Fleminger and Ponsford, 2005). These are associated with dopaminergic abnormalities, including direct damage to dopaminergic nuclei, axonal injury to dopaminergic neurons and subsequent changes in dopamine production, metabolism and clearance (Jenkins et al., 2016;Bales et al., 2009). Neuroimaging studies of the human dopaminergic system after TBI have been limited. Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels can be reduced (Wagner et al., 2005;Donnemiller et al., 2000;Wagner et al., 2014), with associated damage within the substantia nigra (SN) and nigrostriatal projections (Jenkins et al., 2018). Previous imaging studies have only investigated D2 receptors, with variable results (Donnemiller et al., 2000, Wagner et al., 2014).  11 CPHNO PET allows D2 and D3 receptors to be measured in vivo (Searle et al., 2010;Tziortzi et al., 2011), providing a more detailed characterization of post-traumatic dopamine receptor abnormalities.\nChanges in dopaminergic function may be relevant to post-traumatic depression, which is very common (Jorge et al., 1993). Around a https:doi.org10.1016j.nicl.2019.101950 Received 22 July 2018; Received in revised form 20 June 2019; Accepted 19 July 2019 third of TBI patients develop major depressive disorder (MDD), with the risk increasing with greater injury severity (Kreutzer et al., 2001). Depression often hinders recovery and leads to long-term morbidity (Dikmen et al., 2003), but biological causes of MDD after TBI have seldom been investigated. In studies of non-traumatic MDD, alterations in dopamine receptors have been shown to be related to depressive symptoms (DHaenen and Bossuyt, 1994) and abnormalities within the limbic system have often been observed (Drevets et al., 2008). High levels of D3 receptors are seen in limbic structures (Murray et al., 1994) and potentially play an important role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders (Sokoloff et al., 2006). Hence,  11 CPHNO has the potential to clarify the aetiology of post-traumatic depression and inform a more targeted approach to treating this disabling condition.\nHere we used  11 CPHNO PET to measure D2D3 receptor availability following TBI. We tested the hypothesis that TBI patients would show abnormalities of  11 CPHNO binding and that patients with and without MDD will show distinct binding patterns. We used structural MRI to examine grey matter volume changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine the relationship to D2D3 receptor availability and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate axonal injury and its relationship to D2D3 receptor availability.",

      "text": "Patients and controls underwent a single PET scan acquired using a Siemens Biograph 16 HI-REZ PET-CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare). The radiotracer  11 CPHNO was administered as an intravenous bolus over 30 s and dynamic PET data was acquired for 90 min. Injected  11 C PHNO did not exceed 3 μg total mass to avoid symptoms of nausea that have previously been reported. Administration of  11 CPHNO below 3 μg have previously been used to effectively quantify D2D3 receptors in vivo (Erritzoe et al., 2014). A low-dose computed tomography (CT) image was acquired prior to administration of the radiotracer for attenuation correction during PET reconstruction. Further information about reconstruction of the dynamic PET images can be found in previously published literature (Searle et al., 2010). In summary, the PET data were binned into 26 frames (8  15 s, 3  60 s, 5  2 min, 5  5 min, 5  10 min) and reconstructed using Fourier re-binning and two-dimensional filtered back projection with a ramp filter at Nyquist cutoff frequency. Image data were smoothed with a Gaussian filter (5 mm full-width at half-maximum). Patients and controls who had PET scanning had a standard high-resolution T1 MPRAGE scan (160 1-mmthick transverse slices, TR  2300 ms, TE  2.98 ms, FA  9, in-plane resolution  1  1 mm, matrix size  256  256, field of view  25.6  25.6 cm), acquired for use in the co-registration of parametric  11 CPHNO BP ND images. Standard high-resolution T1 was acquired using two Siemens 3T Verio MRIs (Siemens Healthcare).\nFor GM volume and DTI analyses, patients and a separate control group were scanned using the same Siemens 3T Verio MRI (Appendix fig. A.1). Acquisition of diffusion weighted imaging for diffusion tensor imaging analysis was performed on a 3T Veiro MRI using a 64-direction protocol with b  1000 smm 2 and four interleaved b  0 smm 2 , with TETR 1039500 ms, 64 contiguous slices, FoV 256 mm and voxel size 2 mm 3 . Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to facilitate assessment of focal lesions in patients was also acquired. No MRI analysis was performed across the two scanners.",

      "text": "Non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND ) images of  11 CPHNO were generated using a molecular imaging and kinetic analysis toolbox (MIAKAT) (Gunn et al., 2016). The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) (Lammertsma and Hume, 1996) with cerebellar grey matter (GM) as the reference region was used for generation of parametric D2 D3 BP ND images, as per previous research (Searle et al., 2010).\nT1 images were segmented into GM and white matter (WM) using SPM8. Tissue segmentations were then warped to a group template using a diffeomorphic non-linear image registration procedure (DARTEL) (Ashburner, 2007). The group template was then registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) space using an affine registration. Parametric  11 CPHNO BP ND images were co-registered to their relative T1 images using a rigid-body registration and then warped into MNI152 space using the template registration flow-fields obtained from the DARTEL registration. Normalized BP ND images were then masked using a thresholded GM template and smoothed (8 mm fullwidth at half-maximum). To investigate the presence of GM atrophy, GM tissue segmentations of patients and controls acquired on the same scanner were warped to a group template using DARTEL and standardized to MNI152 space for use in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (Ashburner and Friston, 2000).\nTwo types of analysis were performed to investigate  11 CPHNO BP ND : voxelwise analysis in images registered into standard MNI152 space and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis performed in subject T1 space.  11 CPHNO BP ND values were extracted using an anatomical atlas previously developed for use in regional analysis of  11 CPHNO data (Tziortzi et al., 2011). The atlas was first affine-registered from MNI152 space to the group template. Next, the atlas was inversely warped to each subjects native T1 using DARTEL and subject-specific flow-fields. Native-space anatomical maps were visually assessed to ensure accuracy of registration. To further improve accuracy, ROIs were intersected with the subjects 30 thresholded GM tissue probability map (p  .3) to extract mean regional BP ND values. Eight ROIs were selected a priori based on their involvement in the dopaminergic system, prominence of dopamine D2D3 receptors and involvement in cognitive and emotional processing. The ROIs selected were; accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hypothalamus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and substantia nigra. Although the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays an important role in dopaminergic functioning within the brain, the size of this region and difficulty to accurately delineate the VTA could lead to unreliable results. We therefore did not explore this region in this analysis given the relatively low spatial resolution of PET and potential partial volume effects. Lesions present on T1 and FLAIR sequences in patients were manually segmented and excluded from ROI and voxelwise analysis.\nDiffusion tensor imaging was used to derive FA as a measure of white matter microstructure. Fractional anisotropy maps were constructed using the DTI-TK toolbox (Zhang et al., 2007) and subsequently skeletonized for ROI analysis using TBSS (Smith et al., 2006). The mean FA for each ROI was extracted across patients and controls to investigate group differences and any relationship to  11 CPHNO BP ND . To examine the effect of TBI on dopaminergic neurons, the nigrostriatal projections (nigro-caudate, nigro-putamen, nigro-accumbens) were included in our analyses. A map of the area through which the nigrostriatal tract passes, as well as nigro-caudate, nigro-putamen and nigronucleus accumbens components of this map, was created using 100 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (Van Essen et al., 2013). Fiber-tracking was performed in both directions between the left and right substantia nigra and the corresponding nucleus accumbens, putamen and caudate using the MRtrix package (Tournier et al., 2012). Three thousand tracks were performed with maximum angle between successive steps limited to 45. A probability mask based on the percentage of tracks passing through each voxel was created for each individual and thresholded at 5. All masks were binarised and masks from the two directions of tracking were combined. A group probabilistic mask that was then thresholded at 25 to create a group mask.\nThe FA values for controls and patients were then extracted using these tract masks to assess any relationships between white matter integrity and binding potentials. We also investigated the impact of TBI upon limbic connections using two tracts (the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus) from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) WM atlas. These tracts were selected as they have previously been implicated in nontraumatic MDD (Zhang et al., 2012). Finally, we measured FA from the anterior thalamic projection as a control region which is commonly affected after injury.",

Results were cluster corrected using threshold-free cluster enhancement and corrected for multiple comparison using family-wise error correction (p  .05). A repeated measures ANOVA was performed for ROI analysis of BP ND across groups, including a group-by-ROI interaction term. Complementary pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction or one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine the drivers of any significant group-by-ROI interactions, again using R version 3.2.3. Previous literature has demonstrated age-related differences in dopaminergic levels (Kaasinen and Rinne, 2002) as well as time-dependent changes to dopaminergic function after TBI (Wagner et al., 2005). Therefore, Pearsons correlation was used to determine if there was a relationship between age, time since injury and regional  11 CPHNO BP ND .\nGM volume differences between patients and controls were assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM was performed using the standardized GM tissue segmentations, using non-parametric permutation tests in FSL with 10,000 permutations.

Previous research has demonstrated reductions to SN volume after TBI and its relationship to dopaminergic changes (Jenkins et al., 2016). We therefore also examined SN volume and its relationship to  11 CPHNO BP ND . GM volume was measured in the SN of patients and controls by intersecting a SN mask with standardized GM tissue segmentations. An independent samples t-test was used to examine group differences, corrected for age and ICV.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Here we present the first use of  11 CPHNO PET to investigate dopaminergic abnormalities following TBI. We show that  11 CPHNO BP ND is lower in the caudate after TBI, and that this abnormality is more prominent in patients with MDD. In addition, greater binding was seen in non-depressed patients in the amygdala compared to controls, suggesting that compensatory changes in the dopamine system might be protective against the development of MDD after TBI.\n11 CPHNO binding reflects the availability of D2 and D3 receptors and can be attributed to receptor density as well as endogenous dopamine levels (Schotte et al., 1996). Although  11 CPHNO preferentially binds to D3 receptors with a 20 fold selectivity over D2 receptors (Gallezot et al., 2012), binding in regions containing both receptors will represent mixed D2 and D3 signal. The relative contributions of D2 and D3 receptors to  11 CPHNO signal within a region is an important consideration when interpreting our findings. Blockade studies using D3-specific antagonists have illustrated that D2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the caudate (Searle et al., 2010;Tziortzi et al., 2011). Therefore, reductions in caudate binding seen in TBI patients may primarily reflect reduced availability of D2 receptors after TBI. In contrast, the amygdala consists of a mixture of D2 and D3 receptors, as shown by human post-mortem studies (Murray et al., 1994;Gurevich and Joyce, 1999). Given the high affinity of  11 C PHNO for D3 receptors, increased binding within the amygdala is likely to indicate increased expression of D3 receptors in this region. Baseline and blockade scans using a D3-specific antagonist to quantify the relative D2 and D3 contributions to  11 CPHNO signal in the amygdala would help to further disentangle the effects of TBI on D2 and D3 receptors in our patients.\nOur findings extend previous work demonstrating dopaminergic abnormalities after TBI (Donnemiller et al., 2000;Wagner et al., 2014). Animal models of TBI show that dopaminergic abnormalities are common and the behavioural consequences can be treated with dopamine re-uptake inhibitors (Wagner et al., 2009). In humans, TBI frequently disrupts dopaminergic pathways through a variety of mechanisms. Focal brainstem damage can directly damage brainstem dopaminergic nuclei, and traumatic axonal injury can damage their white matter projections (Jenkins et al., 2018). The effect of these changes has consistently been observed as a reduction in DAT in the striatum after TBI (Wagner et al., 2005;Donnemiller et al., 2000;Wagner et al., 2014). DAT is the main regulator of synaptic dopamine levels and this change is likely to be due to a compensatory downregulation in response to reduced synaptic dopamine levels. Although we did not find evidence of axonal injury in dopaminergic projections, nigro-caudate FA was related to dopaminergic abnormalities in the caudate of TBI patients, suggesting an important role for dopaminergic projections and the compensatory changes to the dopaminergic pathways observed after TBI.\nA small number of studies on the effects of TBI on dopamine receptor distributions have been conducted but D3 receptors have not previously been investigated. Animal studies have not provided evidence for chronic changes in D2 receptors after TBI (Wagner et al., 2005). However in humans, chronic changes have been reported. Donnemiller and colleagues reported reductions of striatal D2 receptor binding using the SPECT tracer 123 I-IBZM in patients who also had reductions of DAT in this region (Donnemiller et al., 2000). In contrast, higher D2 receptor binding has been seen in the ventral striatum using the PET ligand  11 Craclopride (Wagner et al., 2014). Our results replicate the finding of reduced D2 receptor binding in the caudate, but also provide some evidence of variability in the effect of TBI on dopamine receptors as (Meyer et al., 2001) whilst increases in D2 receptor binding have been associated with recovery from clinical depression over time (Larisch et al., 1997). A relationship between dopaminergic abnormalities and depressive symptoms has also been observed in other neurological conditions. Depression is commonly seen in Parkinsons disease (PD), where striatal DAT and D2 receptor levels are often reduced (Vriend et al., 2014;Antonini et al., 1997). Depressed patients with PD have also been shown to have significantly reduced DAT binding in the caudate compared to non-depressed PD patients (Remy et al., 2005). Similarly, in Huntingtons disease (HD) (a disease associated with neuronal cell loss in the caudate (Roth et al., 2005) and dopaminergic abnormalities), many patients develop depressive illness (Paulsen et al., 2005). TBI patients without MDD showed higher  11 CPHNO binding in the amygdala compared to controls, which might indicate a compensatory change in D3 receptor expression that protects against the development of depression after TBI. However, this must be considered carefully given the small group sizes and no significant differences being detected between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patient groups. Nevertheless, the amygdala is widely implicated in the regulation of mood and affect. In non-TBI depressed patients, pathophysiological changes to this region have included alterations in resting glucose metabolism, volume and dopamine transmission (Drevets, 2003;Klimek et al., 2002). Dopamine plays an important role in the modulation of the amygdala and its response to stimuli (Kienast et al., 2008). Interestingly, animal models have demonstrated that antidepressant treatments (such as tricyclic antidepressants) selectively increase D3 receptor expression (Lammers et al., 2000) and D3-receptor agonists such as pramipexole have antidepressant properties in both humans and animal models (Willner, 1983;Goldberg et al., 1999). It is conceivable that D3 receptor upregulation after TBI might provide similar benefits to antidepressant treatment and that measuring D2D3 receptor levels might inform the choice of effective anti-depressant medication after TBI.\nWe also found evidence for abnormalities in white matter connections within the limbic system, with more widespread damage seen in depressed patients. Diffusion abnormalities were seen in the cingulum and uncinate fasciculi bilaterally. These white matter tracts connect nodes in the limbic system and similar diffusion abnormalities in these tracts have previously been observed in patients with non-traumatic depression (Zhang et al., 2012;Keedwell et al., 2012). Damage to the uncinate fasciculus connections were only seen in depressed TBI patients, suggesting that damage to the connections between the prefrontal cortex and amygdalahippocampal gyrus may be an important factor in the development of post-traumatic depression.\nThere are a number of potential limitations to our work. Firstly, as expected, there was evidence of post-traumatic atrophy in some brain regions. It is possible that this might have influenced our PET results. However, this is unlikely to be a major influence on our results as there was no relationship between regional volume and binding in either the caudate or any other ROI. In addition, cerebellar SUVs were similar in the control and patient groups indicating that there was not a systematic bias between the groups in our reference regions. Secondly, we focused on studying D2D3 dopaminergic receptors. It is possible to provide a more complete description of post-traumatic dopaminergic abnormalities and future research would benefit from measuring additional factors such as DAT levels in conjunction with  11 CPHNO binding. In addition, we used an automated atlas method to derive ROIs. This process may be susceptible to noise due to misalignment in smaller subcortical regions compared to manual delineation. However, we used an advanced DARTEL registration method that has previously been used for PET data and has superior registration to earlier nonlinear techniques.\nOur study had small sample sizes within our TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patient groups, which might have impacted on the power to detect differences. Hence, our findings should be viewed as preliminary evidence for the role of dopaminergic changes in TBI-MDD. We did not observe any significant differences between the two TBI groups but did identify different patterns of altered  11 CPHNO BP ND when comparing each group to healthy controls. Future studies would benefit from larger group sizes to determine whether there are distinct differences between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patients that we were underpowered to detect. This would help to further clarify whether the observed patterns of altered binding across the TBI groups are specific to psychiatric outcomes. Although the sample sizes are small between these groups, our findings suggest some potentially interesting D2D3 regions to explore further in much larger patient groups.",

      "text": "In conclusion, we provide evidence of altered D2D3 receptor binding after TBI, using  11 CPHNO PET for the first time in this patient population. Patterns of D2D3 receptor abnormalities in clinically depressed and non-depressed TBI patients varied when compared to controls. Lower caudate binding supports previous findings of D2 abnormalities after TBI (Jenkins et al., 2018) and provide a potential mechanistic link between altered dopaminergic function in the caudate and the development of post-traumatic depression. These findings are preliminary, and future research extending this work using larger sample sizes is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Background Understanding the pathological characteristics of various mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes is crucial for the differential diagnosis of dementia. The purpose of this study was to feature divergent symptom-deficit profiles in amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Methods T1 and DTI MRI data from a total of 158 older adults with 50 normal controls, 56 aMCI, and 52 naMCI were included. The voxel-wise gray matter volumes and the number of seed-based white matter fiber bundles were compared among these three groups. Furthermore, correlation and mediation analyses between the neuroimaging indices and cognitive measures were performed. Results The aMCI with specific memory abnormalities was characterized by volumetric atrophy of the left hippocampus but not by damage in the linked white matter fiber bundles. Conversely, naMCI was characterized by both the altered volume of the right inferior frontal gyrus and the significant damage to fiber bundles traversing the region in all three directions, not only affecting fibers around the atrophied area but also distant fibers. Mediation analyses of gray matter-white matter-cognition showed that gray matter atrophy affects the number of fiber bundles and further affects attention and executive function. Meanwhile, fiber bundle damage also affects gray matter volume, which further affects visual processing and language. Conclusions The divergent structural damage patterns of the MCI subtypes and cognitive dysfunctions highlight the importance of detailed differential diagnoses in the early stages of pathological neurodegenerative diseases to deepen the understanding of dementia subtypes and inform targeted early clinical interventions.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The heterogeneity among the patients may be the cause of the failure of clinical intervention studies targeting mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the early stage of dementia 1. Based on the differences of cognitive impairments, MCI can be classified into amnestic MCI (aMCI; 2) or non-amnestic MCI (naMCI; 3), which primarily leads to Alzheimers disease (AD; 2) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; 4) respectively. The brain damage exhibited in AD mainly occurs in the medial temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Conversely, FTD is distinguished from AD by frontal lobe damage 5. Investigating the pathologic characteristics of these two MCI subtypes is crucial for successful early intervention efforts and differential diagnosis of dementia.\nThe loss of neurofibrils and neuronal soma are two distinct pathologic processes that occur in different degrees and locations in AD and FTD. Researches have shown that white matter atrophy plays an important role in FTD pathophysiology 6, distinct from the predominant gray matter damage observed in AD 7. This difference in affected areas and tissues has been linked to specific cognitive impairments in these dementias. For instance, executive dysfunction in FTD is related to both gray and white matter damage in the frontal lobe, while memory decline in AD is associated with gray matter damage in the temporal lobe 7. Another recent study found that alterations to short-range white matter fiber bundles impacted language, while alterations to long-range white matter fiber bundles affected executive function 8. The MCI population exhibits extensive cognitive impairment, making them an ideal choice for exploring patterns of brain structure damage that may reflect distinct neuropathological aging processes.\nIn the present study, we aim to clarify the characteristics of key brain structural pathologic damages in patients with aMCI and naMCI. To accomplish this, we employed voxel-based morphometric analysis of gray matter and seed-based individual white matter bundle deterministic fiber tracking. We hypothesized that (1) both aMCI and naMCI would exhibit unique gray matter damage patterns, with naMCI showing more extensive white matter injury; (2) white matter connectivity damage in individuals with naMCI is not only present in the proximal regions but also in the distal regions, reflecting differential cognitive impairments; and that (3) cognitive functions requiring coordination among multiple brain regions, such as attention and execution, would have a closer association with white fiber connectivity, whereas other cognitive functions may be more closely related to the volume of local brain regions.",

The validation of the diagnosis was performed by D.C. at the time of subject inclusion. The accuracy of the diagnosis was ensured by evaluating each cognitive domain with 2-3 cognitive tests. Impairment in a specific domain was determined if the participant had at least two cognitive test scores that were more than 1.5 standard deviations below the age-and education-adjusted norm. Specifically, aMCI was diagnosed based on memory impairment, while naMCI was diagnosed based on intact memory and the impairment of at least one other cognitive domain (i.e., visual ability, language, attention, andor executive function). Drawing upon the aforementioned criteria, we classified the baseline data of 5990 individuals with assessable MCI into the following categories: 4822 individuals exhibited normal cognitive function elderly, 480 were diagnosed with single-domain aMCI, 480 with naMCI, and 208 with multi-domain aMCI (MCI with memory impairment and impairment in one or more additional cognitive domains). Furthermore, within the dataset containing baseline MRI records from 953 individuals, we identified 24 cases of multi-domain aMCI (see Supplemental Fig. 1). The participants included in our final analysis of this current study were aMCI group which consisted of participants with single-domain impairment only, while the naMCI group included participants with single-or multi-domain impairments, aimed at better distinguishing between MCI with and without memory impairment. The normal control group included participants who demonstrated no impairment on all the above cognitive tests, no subjective cognitive complaint, and were matched on demographic variables and numbers with the other groups. The final sample consisted of 50 normal control individuals, 56 aMCI individuals, and 52 naMCI individuals. DTI data from 6 aMCI and 1 naMCI subject were excluded due to quality issues.",

The CAT toolbox within SPM12 was utilized to perform voxel-based morphometry analysis 20. The images were skull-stripped and bias-corrected and segmented into gray matter, white matter, or cerebrospinal fluid maps which were normalized with the DARTEL algorithm and smoothed with an 8-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was computed for each participant by summing the volumes of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and used as a covariate in the subsequent analysis.\nThe DTI data were pre-processed using the Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges (PANDA: www. nitrc. org proje cts panda) through MATLAB. The data was coregistered to the b0 image using an affine transformation to correct the eddy-current induced distortions and simple head-motion artifacts. Then, the diffusion gradient directions were adjusted, and tensor matrix and diffusion tensor metrics were calculated, with the main focus being fractional anisotropy (FA). A seed-based approach was used for deterministic fiber tracking, with fibers crossing the seed point being included without directional restrictions. The stopping criteria were an FA value of at least 0.2 and a bending angle not exceeding 45 within a voxel.",

The significance level was set at a voxel-level p  0.001 with a cluster-level p  0.05 (GRF-corrected). The volumes of significant gray matter clusters were compared between groups, and cluster masks were used in the subsequent white matter analyses.\nComparison of the structural connectivity among groups was based on inseparable local brain volume. The deterministic fiber tracking in each individual DTI space was passed through the seeds from the gray matter analysis. In addition, to explore the change pattern of different directions and distances of fiber bundles, we segmented the tracked fibers with the center point of gray matter region along the three orthogonal directions in the 3D space (X, Y, Z in MNI coordinates) separately on the average value of each participant. The number of fiber bundles and each segment among groups were compared with the significance level at p  0.05 with FDR-corrected over segments.\nCorrelations between neuroimaging indices and cognitive test scores (corrected for age, gender and education) were computed, with a significant level at p  .05 to make these changes of neuroimaging indexes be meaningful and interpretable. Moreover, mediation analyses were performed with gray matter volume and white matter fiber bundle number, both serving as an independent variable and a mediator, and cognitive test scores as the dependent variable. The analyses were performed using bootstrap method to determine which of the local regions volume or connectivity is more directly relevant to cognitive functions across all populations in this study.",

The declines were concentrated at the proximal end of the center rather than the distal end of fibers passing from left to right when segmenting the fiber bundles (Supplemental Table 3 and Fig. 3), which may mainly involve the right anterior thalamic radiation. From the anterior to posterior direction, disruptions were focused at the front proximal end, mainly involving the right inferior frontooccipital fasciculus. From the inferior to superior direction, declines were concentrated at the distal end of the center rather than the proximal end, mainly involving the right superior longitudinal fasciculus.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The study aimed to uncover the divergent structural damage patterns of aMCI and naMCI and their correlation with impaired cognition. Results indicated that the structural damage in aMCI primarily affected the volume of the hippocampus and was related to memory, overall cognitive ability, and language. However, analysis of naMCI showed gray matter atrophy in the inferior frontal gyrus, with significant damage to fiber bundles traversing the region in all three directions, not only affecting fibers around the atrophied area but also distant fibers. It was observed that the number of fiber bundles in this frontal region had a closer connection with execution and attention, while the volume atrophy was more closely linked to language and visual ability. 3 Group differences of each fiber bundle segment number based on the seed of the triangular part of right inferior frontal gyrus along X, Y, Z axis (MNI coordinates). The central point of the seed in the X, Y, Z axis direction fell on the 11th, the 5th, and the 7th segment, separately. The symbol  b  indicates the following: statistically significant difference between controls and naMCI at FDR-corrected p  0.05. The symbol  c  indicates the following: statistically significant difference between aMCI and naMCI at FDR-corrected p  0.05. The symbol  c  indicates the following: statistically marginally significant difference between aMCI and naMCI at FDR-corrected p  0.05 (See figure on next page.) The association between the hippocampus and memory has been extensively researched and proven. This brain region often experiences atrophy in memoryrelated neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and aMCI 21. Indeed, the present study found that individuals with aMCI had significant atrophy in the volume of hippocampus compared to control group, and this atrophy accompanied by declines in memory. Unlike some previous studies 22, this study did not find any other structural changes in the brains of aMCI individuals, such as atrophy of other brain regions or white matter. The possible two reasons for these differences may be attributed to the definition of aMCI and the indicators used. First, it is related to the aMCI definition. Some studies 23 have included patients with memory impairment and other cognitive impairments as aMCI. The brain structural differences explored may thus represent the impairment of other cognitive functions; second, it is related to the brain indicators used in different studies. A previous study found decreased cortical thickness in the precuneus region of aMCI individuals 22. However, other studies have only found gray matter atrophy (but not white matter) in the hippocampus 24. A recent meta-analysis 21 of 31 studies found that changes in the hippocampus and surrounding regions (such as the parahippocampus and amygdala, which was also examined in this study) were highly reproducible, while no changes in other brain regions were reproducible.\nThe present study found that naMCI individuals had significant atrophy of gray matter in the right inferior frontal gyrus, which is related to various cognitive functions, including execution 25, attention 25, language 26, and visual ability 27. The damage to fiber bundles in this area mainly involved the right inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, the anterior thalamic radiation, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, a bunch of long complex fiber bundles connecting the orbitofrontal cortex to the occipital lobe, is thought to participate in reading, attention, executive function, and visual processing 28. The anterior thalamic radiation with nerve fibers serves as part of the fronto-striato-thalamic loop and provides important contributions to executive function 29. The superior longitudinal fasciculus, with an obvious endpoint in the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyri, plays a role in both attention and language 30. The disconnections of these complex fiber bundles passing through the right inferior frontal gyrus may jointly explain various cognitive disorders in the naMCI population. It is worth noting that asymmetric loss of these fiber bundles in different directions may indicate different patterns of fiber damage, with the superior longitudinal fasciculus possibly being damaged at its distal end, and the remaining fiber bundles at the proximal end.\nThe fiber bundles were found to mediate the relationships between gray matter volume and attention and executive function. Other studies have determined that white matter hyperintensities better characterize these cognitive functions in elderly individuals without cognitive impairment than gray matter volume 31. Moreover, studies on neurodegenerative, including FTD, have found that white matter disruption is a significant factor in executive function impairment 7. Studies have shown that the integrity of white matter fibers connecting the frontal lobe impacts executive function 32; indeed, we observed the disconnection of fibers near the gray matter region 29. These cognitive functions that depend on networks may require increased connectivity with different regions, provided by additional fiber bundles, for normal functioning such as the fronto-parietal network and ventral attention network 33.\nSome studies have shown that gray matter played as a more influential factor than white matter to affect cognition, particularly memory 34, and in memory-impaired participants, such as AD 35. This pattern suggests that different cognitive functions may have distinct closely associated pathways. Indeed, visual ability and language were more closely related to gray matter than white matter. The structure of the occipital region, which is far from the frontal lobe, may also play a role in visual ability 33. Our fiber segmentation analysis indicated that the decline in spatial ability observed in MCI patients was not due to a decrease in posterior distal fiber bundles, suggesting that white matter damage was not the cause. A significant decline in language was also found in the amnestic MCI group, suggesting that language is not solely dependent on the frontal lobe. The inferior frontal gyrus is considered an important area for language production 36, but the language tasks in this study were relatively simple and directly related to language production, so performance may be more related to the functions of specific brain regions than the connections between networks, such as the temporal lobe, which is crucial for language comprehension.\nOne limitation of the study is that the sample population of naMCI consisted of patients with multiple cognitive impairments. In this study, there were relatively fewer individuals with single-domain naMCI, especially within the domains of language and visual abilities. The study was unable to investigate the characteristics of individuals who had specific cognitive impairments. As a result, the brain regions that were found to be atrophied in this study may not be the main regions responsible for these cognitions. Precision medicine requires the accurate classification of patients and a detailed description of the corresponding pathological characteristics. Despite this limitation, the study found strong correlations between these cognitive functions and brain indices, which future studies with larger sample sizes with specific cognitive impairment can test and verify.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "The aMCI was characterized by atrophy of the left hippocampal volume, while the naMCI exhibited both volumetric atrophy and disconnection of fiber bundles traversing the right inferior frontal gyrus, affecting both long-range and short-range fibers. The divergent structural damage patterns result in the emergence of different subtypes of MCI, leading to a decline in corresponding cognitive function. These findings suggest that accurately detecting patients with diverse cognitive impairments in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases can deepen our understanding of dementia subtypes or other severe degenerative diseases and offer potential avenues for early clinical interventions.",

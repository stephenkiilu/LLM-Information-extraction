    "abstract": "Objective: A large proportion of stroke patients experience cognitive impairment. Previous studies found that handgrip training can improve cognitive dysfunction after stroke through an unknown mechanism. In this study, we aimed to examine the influence of handgrip training on the cognition of patients with acute mild ischemic stroke and explore the mechanism using an advanced post-processing method for magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: Seventy-six patients with acute mild ischemic stroke were recruited for this study and randomly divided into a grip training group (n  37) and a control group (n  39). Both groups of patients also received standardized treatment for stroke in the acute phase and for secondary prevention, as well as conventional physical therapy after stroke. Grip strength, global cognitive function, and the local and global efficiencies of white matter networks derived from diffusion tensor images were measured before and after the 12-week training period. Results: In the within-group comparisons, grip training significantly improved the grip strength (3.52 3.09-3.96, p  0.02), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (2.27 1.68-2.86, p  0.05), and local, but not global, efficiency of the brain white matter network (0.03 0.02-0.03, p  0.02) in the experimental group. In contrast, these parameters were not statistically different over the same period in the control group. In the between-groups comparisons, the improvement of grip strength (2.71 2.20-3.21, p  0.01), MoCA (1.17 0.39-1.95, p  0.05), and local efficiency (0.02 0.01-0.03, p  0.01) showed statistically significant differences after the intervention, but not the absolute value of them, neither at the base line nor after the intervention. Conclusions: Our results indicate that grip training can improve cognitive function by increasing the local efficiency of brain white matter connectivity. This suggests that white matter remodeling is a potential physiological mechanism connecting grip training and cognition improvement.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It is also an important public health problem. Stroke has a high probability of causing cognitive impairment, and a meta-analysis has shown that the incidence of cognitive dysfunction after stroke is as high as 30 1. Even in patients with minor stroke, cognitive impairment is common 2, and the associated problems reduce the quality of life of patients 3. The impaired grip function is also common.\nStudies have shown that grip strength is correlated with cognitive function 4567. Grip strength can be used as a biomarker of cognitive function in older adults 8 or a predictor of cognitive function decline in 10 years 9. Interestingly, handgrip training can improve cognitive dysfunction after stroke 10,11. However, the underlying mechanism for the correlation between hand grip and cognitive function remains to be explored. Since white matter lesions affect both grip strength and cognitive function 12, and considering the plasticity of white matter after stroke, we hypothesized that handgrip training can benefit white matter repair to improve both physiological function and cognition after stroke.\nThe structural integrity of cerebral white matter can be evaluated using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), to characterize the structure of white matter fibers by measuring the Brownian motion of water molecules. DTI has also been used as a prognostic biomarker for motor recovery and rehabilitation after stroke 13. Stroke is currently considered a network disease, and network assessment is a powerful tool to predict the response to treatment 14. Therefore, we rebuilt a white matter network based on DTI fiber tracking from brain imaging data 15 to study white matter remodeling during rehabilitation after stroke. With this method, an automated anatomical labeling template 16 is used to divide the gray matter on T1-weighted imaging (T1W1) into 90 brain regions, defined as the nodes of the brain network. The white matter fibers are then identified through DTI fiber tracking as the connection among the nodes and thereby the edge of the regional network. Specific attributes are found in these networks. The topological attributes of the whole or part of the networks are measured by using graph theory analysis to quantify the connectivity of the networks. This technology has the advantages of automation and the ability to evaluate the connectivity of a patients white matter structure at the whole brain level. This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with acute mild ischemic stroke received intensive training. We assessed the patients cognitive function and brain white matter connection as well as grip strength before and after the training to explore the effect of early intensive grip training intervention after stroke on the grip strength, cognitive function, and white matter connection.",

Additionally, the experimental group received 12-week intensive grip training for both hands using a grip training device with a digital readout (Model HG-2323B, KYTO, Guangdong, China). Briefly, the patients were trained in a standing or sitting posture with the upper arm hanging and the elbow at a right angle. They were asked to clench their grip on the grip training device to the upper limit (10 kg) or with their maximum strength without moving the arm. They maintained their pressure on the grip training device for 2 s and relaxed for 1 s 20. Each hand performed this exercise at least 500 times a day in about 50 min in one or no more than five sessions. Each patient received at least 3 days of grip training each week. A total of 37 participants in the experimental group and 39 participants in the control group finished the intervention and control sessions, respectively.\nSix patients dropped out due to repeated stroke events or other serious illnesses or for other reasons. The training was well-tolerated by the remaining patients. Except for slight delayed muscle soreness after training, no other adverse reactions occurred. All 76 patients who completed the experiments were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1).",

Specifically, the brain gray matter was segmented into 90 regions (network nodes) by using Anatomic-Automatic-Labeling (AAL) atlas. The areas with fractional anisotropy (FA) greater than 0.2 for each voxel were judged as white matter fibers. The areas with an angle of rotation less than 45  between each voxel were regarded as the same bundle of fibers, and the mean FA values of the fibers between each pair of the nodes were regarded as the networks edges. The major process of building a whole brain white matter structure network is shown in Fig. 2.\nAfter the networks were constructed, graph theory was applied to describe them through the GRETNA toolbox 25. The efficiency of the network, including the local and global efficiencies 26, were used to measure the connectivity of the brain white matter network. The local efficiency of a network is the average efficiency of each node in the network and reflects the degree of clustering in the network. This parameter represents the information transmission capability in the local region of the network and the networks ability to defend itself against random attacks. Local efficiency is mainly affected by the intensity of short fiber connections 27. The global efficiency of a network is the average of the shortest path length of information from one node to another in the network and reflects the overall transmission capability of information for the whole brain. The global efficiency is mainly affected by the intensity of long-range fiber connections. The local (E loc ) and global (E glob ) efficiencies were evaluated as follows.\nWhere E(i) is the local efficiency of the nodes, N is the number of nodes, and l ij is the shortest path length between every two nodes.",

As shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in age, gender, educational level, severity of the stroke, lesion location, lesion volume, time from stroke onset to hospitalization or enrollment, and chief clinical symptoms, represented by motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms include facial, tongue, or limb paralysis, while non-motor symptoms consisted of aphasia, dysarthria, sensory impairment, and cognitive impairment. Lesions were obtained from regions with abnormally high signals in T2WI with the assistance of DTI images. Lesion volume was calculated using the most common formula ABC2 29. For patients with multiple infarcts, the sum of the volumes of all infarcts was regarded as the stroke volume. Lesion location was described as left or right, and cortical or subcortical. Thus, these factors could be excluded as confounding factors. In contrast, the local efficiency did not statistically improve in the control group over the same time period (p  1.00). However, the increases in global efficiency in both the grip training and control groups were not statistically significant (p  0.17, p  1.00, respectively).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Handgrip strength has been reported to be highly correlated with cognitive function, which can be improved by grip training. However, the structural basis for this correlation has not been established. Since white matter lesions affect both the grip strength and cognitive function 12, we hypothesized that handgrip training could promote white matter repair to improve white matter connectivity, benefitting both motor and cognition functions. In this study, we demonstrated that grip training can improve the cognitive function of patients with minor acute stroke. Furthermore, by taking advantage of a method for constructing a structure network based on DTI and analyzing the network using graph theory to describe the connectivity of brain white matter, we demonstrated that grip training can significantly increase the local efficiency of the brain white matter network. Our results suggest that grip training can improve grip strength and cognitive function by increasing the local efficiency of the connectivity of brain white matter.\nThe major advantage of this study is that we employed an advanced brain structure analysis method to build a white matter structure network for the white matter connection efficiency at the whole brain level to uncover the potential underlying mechanism for the improvement of cognitive function by grip strength training. This technique has been applied to study cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and indicated that network disruption has a central role in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in SVD, and the global efficiency could be regarded as a disease marker for SVD patients with dementia 30. Another study suggested that brain network analysis based on the local and global efficiencies may be more informative than examining individual lesions to understand the impact of SVD on cognition in minor stroke patients 31. In this study, the same method was applied to study the dynamic changes in white matter connectivity in minor stroke patients, which would provide rather powerful and credible data.\nSeveral studies have found that grip strength is correlated with global cognition and various cognitive domains in the general population and in schizophrenia patients 4, as well as in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes 5. Taekema et al. 6 studied the older population and found that in addition to attention and reaction speed, their grip strength was significantly correlated with the function of other cognitive domains. Bjork et al. 7 found that a decline in grip strength was correlated with several cognitive domains. In stroke patients, global cognition, but not other cognitive domains, can be affected by physical exercise, represented by grip strength training 23. In this study, the MoCA score, which has been confirmed by many studies to be a sensitive and specific method to assess global cognitive function, was evaluated and was significantly increased after grip strength training, indicating that the training can improve cognitive function in acute minor stroke patients. This result is partially consistent with the conclusions in previous studies 10,11.\nThere are three potential mechanisms underlying the correlation between cognitive function and motor function: (1) motor function, represented by grip strength, affects cognitive function 32; (2) cognitive function affects motor function 33; (3) other factors simultaneously influence both the motor and cognitive functions. These factors include cerebral connectivity 12, inflammatory cytokines 34, testosterone and other hormones 35, and genetic factors 36. Our results further show that intensive grip training can enhance the connectivity of white matter fibers, especially for local short fibers. Neuroplasticity is an important basis for rehabilitation after stroke, and ischemic stroke is more closely associated with brain remodeling. Many recent studies have shown that early exercise training promotes neuroplasticity through various mechanisms 373839. High-intensity resistance training results in more significant improvements in nerve plasticity 40. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous reports that grip strength training enhances the plasticity of the white matter after stroke, leading to increased white matter connectivity and improved neuronal communication and cognitive function.\nIn recent years, grip strength has been recommended as a necessary biomarker for older adults 8 and has received increasing attention. Studies have shown that stroke affects the grip strength not only on the affected side, but also on the healthy side 41,42. Bilateral grip strength training can greatly improve grip strength 10, which may prevent the loss of cognitive function 11. In this study, we performed bilateral grip training and bilateral assessments of grip strength. Our results suggest that even short-term grip training can significantly improve bilateral grip strength and cognitive function. Since grip training is a safe and easy method, it can be used as a potential routine rehabilitation therapy for middle-aged and elderly stroke patients.\nWe also recognize the limitation of this study in that we only observed significant differences in the improvement, but not the absolute value of grip strength, MoCA and local efficiency in the between-groups analyses. This may be due to the small sample size and strict multiple corrections. Thus, the conclusions need to be further confirmed with larger sample sizes, longer intervention, and multicenter studies in the future.",

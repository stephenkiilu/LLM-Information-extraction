    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in blood-oxygenation-leveldependent (BOLD) signals to detect brain activities. It has been recently reported that the spatial correlation patterns of resting-state BOLD signals in the white matter (WM) also give WM information often measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). These correlation patterns can be captured using functional correlation tensor (FCT), which is analogous to the diffusion tensor (DT) obtained from DTI. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust FCT method aiming at further improving its quality, and making it eligible for further neuroscience study. The novel FCT estimation method consists of three major steps: First, we estimate the initial FCT using a patchbased approach for BOLD signal correlation to improve the noise robustness. Second, by utilizing the relationship between functional and diffusion data, we employ a regression forest model to learn the mapping between the initial FCTs and the corresponding DTs using the training data. The learned forest can then be applied to predict the DTI-like tensors given the initial FCTs from the testing fMRI data. Third, we re-estimate the enhanced FCT by utilizing the DTI-like tensors as a feedback guidance to further improve FCT computation. We have demonstrated the utility of our enhanced FCTs in Alzheimers disease (AD) diagnosis by identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients from normal subjects.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as the primary non-invasive technique for measuring neural activity in the brain. Since the introduction of fMRI in the early 1990s, it has been widely used for its sensitivity to developmental, aging and pathological processes of various organs 1. fMRI is designed to detect hemodynamic changes in the gray matter (GM) regions, which are known to be associated with the neural activity 2. An increase of the neural activation usually causes increased local cerebral blood flow to supply the metabolic demands 3. The measurement of such variation is called blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) time series.\nExtensions of fMRI have been proposed for the needs in different clinical and research fields. For example, task-based fMRI 4 was developed to localize functionally specialized brain regions under specific task stimulus. On the other hand, the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) 5 is collected in a task-free state and has usually been applied to discover correlated activity patterns or functional connectivity (FC) among different brain regions, in an either local or distant manner. However, in contrast to the GM regions, it is much harder to detect the BOLD signals in the brain white matter (WM), as WM is irrigated by much less dense vasculature 6 and the blood flow in WM is approximately one-fourth of that in GM 7.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), or more generally, the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), has been recognized as an effective tool in the study of the WM 8. DTI quantifies the diffusion patterns of water molecules using a diffusion tensor (DT) represented by a 33 symmetric matrix. The movement of water molecules is less constrained in the axonal direction than the perpendicular directions. Thus, using a diffusion tensor model, the distribution of movement of water molecules can be simply represented by an ellipsoid, with the axonal direction given by the major axis. Various diffusion parameters, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), can be calculated based on the DTs. These parameters have been used extensively for WM abnormality detection for various neurological and psychiatric diseases 9. Furthermore, the directions of the DTs can be further employed using diffusion tractography to map WM fiber pathways 10, complementary to the GM connectivity information given by FC networks 11. fMRI has also been used to investigate connectivity in WM. For instance, it was found in 12 that fMRI activation can also be observed in the genu of the corpus callosum. This finding was confirmed by DArcy et al. 13 using a Sperry task. Activation in the splenium of the corpus callosum was also observed, providing the first fMRI evidence of posterior callosal activation associated with an interhemispheric transfer task. The work in Mazerolle et al. 14 expanded and refined the approach taken by DArcy et al. 13. Outside of the corpus callosum, BOLD fMRI activation has also been reported, such as in the internal capsule. For example, Mosier and colleagues reported activation associated with swallowing in the internal capsule, as well as the corpus callosum 15. Also, Gawryluk et al. 16 found that activation can be detected in the internal capsule during a motor task (i.e., finger tapping), which was later confirmed by Mazerolle et al. in 17. These findings indicate that the BOLD fMRI signals potentially exist in the WM regions due to the existence and detectability of the vasculature, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the WM 18. Marussich et al. 19 also investigated spatiotemporal correlation of BOLD fMRI signals in WM, comparing between eye-closed resting state and visualperception tasks. They showed WM functional connectivity in the resting-state session, as well as significant correlations between optical radiations and multiple cortical visual networks.\nRecently, Ding et al. 20 found the weak but putative local temporal correlation of BOLD signals that persists over a long distance along the same WM neuronal fiber tracts using rs-fMRI. This study found functional anisotropy of local FCs between a central WM voxel and its neighboring voxels. They captured this anisotropy using a local spatiotemporal correlation tensor and demonstrated that the realistic fiber bundle can be obtained by tracing the directions of FCs. They subsequently introduced functional correlation tensor (FCT) in 21 and demonstrated the ability of FCT in revealing several major WM fiber bundles, indicating that FCT is coherent with DTI. However, our experiments indicate that FCTs are sensitive to noise. Since there is only 1-3 signal variability associated with the BOLD signal in GM 22, while it is much less in WM 23, computing FC in WM is challenging.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, here we propose a novel framework for further improving FCT estimation with the guidance of DT information. The aim is to reduce the influence of noise in WM to the FCT estimation, which is referred from the finding of the consistency between the WM fiber direction and the spatiotemporal correlation pattern of the WM BOLD signals 20,21. The main contribution in this paper is four-fold: First, we develop a novel strategy, aiming at increasing the noise robustness of FCT using a patchbased approach. Second, to cater to the possibility that only rs-fMRI but not DTI data are available, we intend to predict DTI-like tensors from the computed FCTs. Specifically, we incorporate the regression forest method to train the learning-based model, which has been successfully applied in many medical image analysis domains, such as image segmentation 242526 and reconstruction 27. We further adopt the cascaded learning strategy using the auto-context model introduced in 28 to boost the performance. Third, we further refine the estimation of FCTs by weighting the dominant directions on the basis of DTI-like tensors. Finally, we have demonstrated the utility of the enhanced FCT in early-stage mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) diagnosis.",

The volunteer subjects were drawn from a population of 1200 healthy adults in the age range of 22-35 years.\nTo reduce the computation cost, we randomly select images of rs-fMRI and DWI from 95 subjects of the HCP dataset.

    "Regression Forest for Mapping Process": {
      "text": "In this section, we describe how the DTI-like tensors can be estimated from rs-fMRI using the HCP dataset. The main idea is to learn using regression forest to map between a 3D cubic patch of FCTs and the corresponding target DT at its center voxel. It is worth noting that, before the process of patch extraction, certain registration works are required for the obtained initial FCTs to ensure the validity of the extracted spatial position features, which will be illustrated later in this section. For the HCP dataset, the initial FCTs are warped to the DTI space using deformation field estimated by registering the single-band reference image of the rs-fMRI data to the DTI b0 image using flirt in FSL. For the ADNI2 dataset, the initial FCTs are aligned to the MNI-152 space with a spatial resolution of 222mm 3 using flirt in FSL.\nWe divide the HCP subjects into training and testing sets. In the training stage, we learn the regression forest model that maps between the 3D cubic patches of initial FCTs to the corresponding target DTs at the center voxels. The forest model is learned using only the training data. 30000 FCT patches are randomly extracted from the whole brain. In the testing stage, the trained forest is applied patch-wise to estimate the DTI-like tensors.\nFeature Extraction-When the patches are extracted from the initial FCTs, the corresponding feature information is then computed, which can be utilized by the forest model to map with the target DT information. Two types of the features are extracted from the patches: spatial position features and appearance features. The spatial position features record the 3D coordinate location of the patchs center voxel. This introduces the spatial prior information to the patch-based learning method, especially in the testing stage where the center locations of the input patches can also determine the results. The appearance features describe the intensity patterns using the 3D Haar-like operators 25,26,34,35 for the effectiveness. Given the input patch P V from the training initial FCTs with its center voxel V, we determine two cubic regions R 1 and R 2 within the patch region R V . Note that the sizes of R 1 and R 2 are also randomly chosen from an arbitrary range, which is 1,3,5 in voxel in our work. The equation of the Haar-like operator is given as follows 26: (5) where f Haar (V, P V ) is the extracted Haar-like feature, and δ is set to choose one or two cubic regions for the computation. Since there are six elements in the vector of the FCT, in the experiments of HCP dataset, we extract 1000 Haar-like features from each element, separately, which are then concatenated with the spatial position information as a single feature vector. In summary, there are totally 6003 features, consisting of 6000 (61000) Haar-like features and 3 spatial position features representing the x, y and z coordinates of the center voxel of the patch. Also note that the parameter values for obtaining the Haar-like features are stored in the training stages, so that the input patches in the testing stage follow the same settings when applying the forest model.\nTraining Stage-We denote the regression forest as F, which is an ensemble of d decision trees K 1 , K 2 , , K d . Each tree is trained by using all the training patches, but different subsets of extracted features that are randomly decided according to the uniform bagging strategy 36. Starting from the root node, the decision trees are constructed by recursively splitting their patch samples into the left and the right children nodes. The splitting function at each node is based on one feature selected by exhaustive search within the feature subset, which can maximize the information gain of the splitted groups of training patches based on their corresponding target values. Note that in the experiments we set the tree number as 20, and the minimum sample number for the leaf node is 8.\nNote that, in the conventional regression forest, each input patch can only have one corresponding target value. Since six elements in the target tensor vector are explicitly interdependent with each other, the conventional regression forest cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we refer to the structured regression forest technique in 37 to overcome this limitation. Here, the splitting function produces six estimates of the information gain corresponding to the six elements of the target DT vector, which are then averaged to obtain the overall estimation. In this way, the forest method can gauge all the information in the target vector for training the regressor. The decision trees stop growing when training samples in the leaf node are insufficient or reaching a pre-set maximal depth. The regressor predictor for the tree K i is denoted as g(f(P, S), K i ), where f(P, S) is the feature vector, P is the input patch, and S is the input initial FCT.\nTesting Stage-Denote the testing FCT as S, the corresponding patch set by traversing the whole brain region is P. We commence by extracting the spatial position features and appearance features from the testing patches by following the same settings as those in the training stage. Every patch in P is then pushed into the root node of the trained tree K i to measure the predictor result as . The overall estimates for the trained forest F is obtained by (6) Cascaded Learning-Recently, Tu and Bai 28 introduced an auto-context model, consisting of cascades of regressors. This is implemented in our context as follows. In the training stage, we construct the regressor in the first stage using the spatial position features and appearance features as described above. The trained regressor is then applied to the initial FCTs for predicting DTI-like tensors. In the second stage, the regressor is constructed by also considering the context features, which are extracted from the output of the first stage using Haar-like operators. The parameters for computing the context features are identical to those for appearance features. Therefore, the number of features for training the second-stage regressor becomes 12003. Due to different feature numbers in the two stages, the maximum tree depths of the regressors should also be different, i.e., 26 and 29 for the first and second stages, respectively. In the testing stage, the trained regressors are applied to the initial FCTs for obtaining the DTI-like tensors.",

      "text": "When the learned forest model is trained by the mapping process described in Section 2.3, it is then applied to the initial FCT from the testing subjects to obtain the corresponding DTIlike tensors. In this section, we show how to use directional information from the learned DTI-like tensors to enhance FCTs. First, each DTI-like tensor is warped back to its subjects fMRI native space to help guide the FCT estimation. The orientation distribution function (ODF) associated with DTI-like tensors 38 β(u) for the unit vector u is defined as (7) where Z is a normalization constant used to ensure that ODF is properly normalized to the unit mass 39, and B is the obtained DTI-like tensor. Note that, as shown in Equation ( 3), the dyadic tensors D with their corresponding correlation coefficient C from different directions are combined together with the same weight. In order to enhance the FCT, here directions with higher β cofficient values will have higher weights than the others. In this way, here we re-estimate the enhanced FCT by following the initial FCT estimation process in Section 2.2, except extending the Equation ( 3) by adding the β coefficient, as below: (8) where the unit direction u computed from V i to V j will be used in Equation ( 7) to get β ij .",

Each template is a probability WM mask indicating inter-subject consistent connections between any pair of Automated Anatomical labeling (AAL) brain regions, generated using the data of 500 subjects in HCP dataset. We also compute the FCT FA maps by using three eigenvalues obtained from the diagonalization of each FCT (see Section 3.1).

Each subject is represented by two feature vectors (i.e., weighted mean and weighted variance), each of which has 359 elements.\nSince the number of features is much larger than the number of subjects in the study, an LASSO-based feature selection algorithm 44 is applied to each feature vector to remove some redundant and irrelevant features.

The images are masked to preserve only the WM regions. The mask is created by thresholding the DTI FA map. Compared with the output from Ding et al., the FCT using our framework greatly reduces noise artifacts. The estimated DTI-like tensors are also consistent with the actual DTI data.\nTo better evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, especially the process of FCT enhancement, we also compute the four parameter maps I AD , I RD , I MD , I FA  from the extracted tensors, which are computed using the three eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3  of the DT as follows: It is worth noting that the average computation time using the method of Ding et al. is around 10 minutes using a standard PC (CPU 3.1GHz i5, memory 24 GB 1333MHz DDR3), while it takes much more time (45 minutes) to obtain the initial FCT using our framework. This is partly due to the greater computational cost associated with the patch-based FCT computation. FCT to DT mapping using regression forest method with the auto-context model also takes about 20 minutes. Speed can be improved via parallelization.\nTo further quantify the similarity between predicted DTI-like tensors and the actual DTs by using Pearsons correlation as the metric. The overall whole-brain correlation coefficient for the first and second stage mapping are 0.6980.064 and 0.7290.068, respectively.

Significant improvement (p  0.05) is marked with an asterisk.

Figure 9 presents the ILF tracts generated from DTI-like tensors of four subjects obtained using our framework. Since the subjects in HCP dataset were aligned to the MNI-152 space using only AC-PC registration 31, there are certain variations of brain structures from different subjects, especially for the ILF tracts.

      "text": "The performance of our method is limited by a number of factors.\nFirst, the three-step framework involves aligning the initial FCT to the common space before mapping can be carried out. The predicted DTI-like tensors are warped back to the individual space for FCT enhancement. Potential registration errors may affect the accuracy of the estimated FCTs. A means to mitigate the effects of registration errors is by using a patch matching mechanism to correct for misalignment 33.\nSecond, FCTs are computed for the whole brain, including the GM that has much higher SNR in terms of BOLD signals than that WM. FCTs at the WM-GM boundary might be affected by the signal differences between the two tissue types. This problem can be ameliorated by using tissue segmentation information from anatomical T1 images so GM and WM can be analyzed separately.\nThird, Ding et al. has presented in 20,21 that some fiber streamlines (e.g. ILF, optic radiation and etc.) can be reconstructed from the estimated FCT. Besides, our enhanced FCTs have shown anistropy in WM regions that are more aligned to the predicted DTI-like tensors as observed in Figure 3 and Figure 4. However, unlike the DTs, it is still hard to implement fiber tracking to the whole WM regions of those obtained FCTs. We attribute this issue to the HCP data, which is multiband echo planar imaging (EPI) data with both higher spatial and temporal resolution, and thus sacrifices the SNR of BOLD signals. In future, we will test our method using more data sets with better SNR, with which we could anticipate a better FCT enhancement performance. Therefore, our ultimate goal, i.e., using FCT to conduct individualized fiber tracking, like DTI, can be achieved.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "In this work, we have presented a novel learning-based framework that improves the quality of FCTs. We proposed a patch-based correlation measurement strategy to improve noise robustness in FCT computation. We also incorporated regression forest with the auto-context model to predict DTI-like tensors from FCTs. The FCTs are then enhanced using the information given by the predicted DTI-like tensors. Experimental results indicate that the quality of FCTs is improved. When used for AD diagnosis, the enhanced FCTs also improves the classification accuracy. The overall pipeline of the proposed FCT calculation framework. Initial FCT computation. For the voxel V i in the brain region of the rs-fMRI data, the process first follows the patch-based correlation measurement strategy to compute the correlation coefficient C ij , which compares the time courses of voxels in Q i centered at V i with those in Q j centered at V j . The dyadic tensor D ij is also prepared to present the directions from V i to V j . The FCT T i is then obtained by computing the sum of all the dyadic tensor with its corresponding correlation coefficients.",

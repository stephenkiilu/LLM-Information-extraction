    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to examine the integrity of midline white matter tracts in APPsw (Tg2576) transgenic mice, a mouse-model of cerebral amyloid deposition. Ex vivo DTI was performed on formalin-fixed brains from APPsw and agematched transgene-negative control mice at the ages of 12, 15, and 17 months. The characteristics of water diffusion in six midline white matter tracts were quantified using four metrics: relative anisotropy (RA), mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Two-way ANOVA analyses indicated a significant main effect of transgene on RA in the corpus callosum (CC) and ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC), due to small reductions (2-6) in RA in APPsw mice relative to age-matched control mice. However, these reductions were not significant at any specific age group and were not progressive with increasing age. The other diffusion metrics exhibited no significant differences between APPsw and control mice in the CC and VHC, nor did any of the diffusion metrics exhibit significant differences between APPsw and control mice in other midline white matter tracts (anterior commissure, posterior commissure, fornix, and dorsal fornix). Overall, these results indicate that white matter integrity, as measured by ex vivo DTI, is predominately unaltered in formalin-fixed brains from amyloid plaque-bearing APPsw mice.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The development of noninvasive imaging approaches for detecting the pathological changes associated with the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) will have a profound effect on the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Considerable ongoing research focuses upon identifying and validating magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers that quantify the structural and functional changes associated with AD. These biomarkers also hold promise for the early detection of AD (Bookheimer et al., 2000;Jack et al., 1999;Killiany et al., 2000). Guided by these human studies, there has been increasing effort to develop analogous, clinically applicable, MR-based biomarkers of the pathological changes that occur in animal models of AD. Since the role of β-amyloid (Aβ) in AD etiology is well supported by genetic studies (reviewed in Selkoe and Podlisny, 2002), and amyloid plaque deposition is a hallmark of AD pathology, the majority of available animal models are based on augmented production and deposition of βamyloid peptides. Thus, the transgenic mouse lines expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and exhibiting amyloid plaque deposition provide a powerful animal model for the discovery and development of biomarkers associated with Aβ production, accumulation, or deposition. Using MR imaging or spectroscopy, changes in metabolic profile (Dedeoglu et al., 2004;Marjanska et al., 2005;von Kienlin et al., 2005), cerebral hemodynamics (Mueggler et al., 2003;Wu et al., 2004), and brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, hippocampal volume, and corpus callosum length (Delatour et al., in press;Redwine et al., 2003;Weiss et al., 2002) have been identified in APP transgenic mice.\nIn addition to physiological and gross morphological changes, MR measurements can be sensitized to the diffusion of water to reveal changes in tissue microstructure. Water diffusion is influenced by numerous molecular restrictions and barriers, including cell membranes, myelin, and cytoskeletal structures (Beaulieu, 2002). In white matter tracts with coherently oriented fibers, these restrictions result in highly anisotropic diffusion, where the diffusivity parallel to the fibers is greater than the diffusivity perpendicular to the fibers. Changes in white matter integrity may alter this pattern of diffusion, which can be detected using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Using DTI, decreases in diffusion anisotropy have been observed in the corpus callosum of some patients with probable AD (Bozzali et al., 2002;Rose et al., 2000;Takahashi et al., 2002), although not always replicated, possibly due to differences in dementia severity in different population samples (Choi et al., 2005;Head et al., 2004). In vivo DTI studies on two distinct APP transgenic mouse lines, the PDAPP (expressing human APP V717F ) (Song et al., 2004) and APPsw (Tg2576, expressing APP K670NM671L ) (Sun et al., 2005b), also indicate decreases in anisotropy, as well as changes in other diffusion-based indices, in some white matter tracts.\nIn the present study, we used ex vivo DTI to investigate the integrity of several midline fiber tracts in APPsw transgenic mice (12, 15, 17 months) relative to age-matched transgenenegative control mice. Imaging was performed on formalinfixed brains in order to collect high-quality diffusion tensor data free of motion-related image artifacts, and to determine whether ex vivo imaging confirms previous in vivo observations of genotype-dependent white matter changes in APP transgenic mice (Song et al., 2004;Sun et al., 2005b). Our overall goal was to evaluate whether DTI examinations of white matter integrity in APP transgenic mice may be useful as endpoints for efficacy studies of therapeutic approaches designed to modify Aβinduced pathological changes. In particular, we wanted to determine whether diffusion-based indices indicated progressive white matter alterations during the time-period that amyloid plaque burden increases markedly in APPsw mice (Callahan et al., 2001;Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). We found evidence of subtle changes in diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum and ventral hippocampal commissure of APPsw mice, but no progressive changes between the ages of 12 and 17 months.",

      "text": "Male transgenic mice hemizygous for the human amyloid precursor protein with Swedish double mutations (APP K670N,M671L driven by the prion protein promoter) (Hsiao et al., 1996) and age-matched male transgene-negative control mice of the same genetic background were studied. Male mice were used to avoid potential confounds of circulating gonadal steroid hormones on the end-points being studied. The ages 12, 15, and 17 months were selected because they reflect the steepest rate of deposition of Aβ (internal unpublished data and Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). Furthermore, we confirmed Aβ deposition in a cohort of female APPsw mice run within the same time frame as the present study by measuring total brain guanidinium-extracted Aβ using ELISA as described previously (Lanz et al., 2003). The Aβ levels (pmolg) were as follows (mean  SEM; n  10): Aβ(1-40): 878  337 at 10 months, 7078  881 at 12 months, 34,137  5039 at 16 months, and 50,224  5122 at 18 months; Aβ(1-42): 203  65 at 10 months, 1431  141 at 12 months, 6969  1307 at 16 months, and 7758  1307 at 18 months. Female mice were used for this purpose to minimize the use of animals as required by NIH guidelines and institutional policies.\nMice were euthanized in a chamber with isoflurane. Immediately upon cessation of breathing, the chest cavity was opened, and the animal perfused intracardially with 15-20 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 15-20 mL of 10 neutral buffered formalin (4 formaldehyde). Brains were extracted and stored in formalin in a 4C refrigerator for 150-180 days prior to imaging. For each genotype and age, eight to nine brains were examined using DTI. All procedures in this study have been approved and were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (9 CFR Parts 1, 2, and 3) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILAR, 1996), as well as with all internal institutional policies and guidelines.",

    "Imaging protocol": {
      "text": "Imaging was performed on a 7.0 T (300 MHz) vertical-bore magnet, with a 55-mm inner-diameter actively shielded gradient coil (25 Gcm, 110 μs rise time) using a Varian INOVA console. The eddy current compensation of this system was carefully optimized prior to the study. A single formalin-fixed brain was placed in a 14-mm inner-diameter cylinder, which was filled with just enough formalin to surround the brain. Teflon plugs were utilized to hold the brain in position and to eliminate any air-formalin interface, thereby reducing susceptibility artifacts. The brain was then centered in a custom-built 20-mm innerdiameter transmit and receive birdcage coil.\nA conventional spin-echo imaging sequence with a pair of Stejskal-Tanner diffusion sensitizing gradients was employed for the acquisition of the diffusion-weighted images. The readout compensation gradient and phase-encoding gradient of this sequence were applied immediately before the signal readout period, so as to minimize the contribution of these imaging gradients to the diffusion weighting. Diffusion weighted images were acquired at ambient room temperature with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)  2 s, echo time (TE)  27 ms, time between the pair of diffusion gradients (Δ)  13 ms, diffusion gradient duration (δ)  8 ms, field of view  1.5  1.5 cm, data matrix  128  128 (zero-padded to 256  256 prior to the Fourier transform), slice thickness  0.5 mm, number of averages  2, and readout bandwidth  36 kHz. Diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along 20 different directions that were determined using an analogy to electrostatic repulsion in order to distribute the directions uniformly in 3-dimensional space (Jones et al., 1999;Skare et al., 2000). The diffusion-sensitizing factor for these images (b value) was 1890 smm 2 . Additionally, three images were collected with no diffusion gradients (b  0, i.e., T2-weighted images), so as to maintain a ratio of 7:1 of diffusion vs. nondiffusion weighted images (Jones et al., 1999). Images were collected using a midsagittal slice whose position was carefully determined using a series of scout images, so that the final imaging slice bisected the midline of the corpus callosum along its entire anteroposterior length. Total acquisition time for each brain was 3.3 h. Three brains from a given age and genotype were imaged in succession, followed by three brains from a different age and genotype, so as to minimize any potential systematic bias across groups. The average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in cortex was 41 for the images with no diffusion weighting and 23 for the images with diffusion weighting.3",

    "Data analysis": {
      "text": "The second-order tensor describing the effective rate of water diffusion was computed from the series of images using constrained nonlinear optimization. Specifically, for each voxel we computed the diffusion tensor (D) that minimized the mean squared difference between the measured voxel intensities and intensities predicted by the standard (mono-exponential) diffusion tensor model. The b-matrix included the diffusion sensitization contributed by both the diffusion and imaging gradients, as well as the cross-terms between all the gradients (Mattiello et al., 1994). As part of the optimization procedure, the estimated diffusion tensor was constrained to have eigenvalues greater than 10 -7 mm 2 s. The optimization utilized a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method implemented in Matlab v6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA).\nSeveral diffusion-based indices were derived from the estimated diffusion tensor. First, the principal diffusivities (eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2 , and λ 3 ) of D were determined for each voxel. These eigenvalues were then used to compute the mean diffusivity (D mean , the average of the eigenvalues) and the relative anisotropy (RA), a measure of diffusion anisotropy defined as the standard deviation of the eigenvalues divided by D mean . In white matter structures with high diffusion anisotropy (i.e., high RA), it is also reasonable to use the largest eigenvalue as a measure of the diffusion parallel to the axons (λ   λ 1 ) and the mean of the remaining two eigenvalues as a measure of the diffusion perpendicular to the axons λ   0.5  (λ 2  λ 3 ). These latter two measures are informative because they may capture different aspects of white matter injury-namely, axonal degeneration in the case of λ  and myelin loss in the case of λ  (Song et al., 2002(Song et al., , 2003(Song et al., , 2005)).\nWhite matter regions-of-interest (ROIs) were defined using a semi-automated procedure. The fiber tracts analyzed included the corpus callosum (CC), ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC), anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), fornix (F), and dorsal fornix (DF). We first identified putative white matter as the pixels whose signal intensity in the mean T2-weighted image (the average of the three images with no diffusion weighting) was lower than 1.25 standard deviations below the mean of the signal intensity distribution for the overall brain. (This value was determined empirically as one that provided a good initial segmentation of midline white matter.) We then used the direction of the tensor eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue (the 1st eigenvector) to refine this initial white matter segmentation. Pixels at the edges of the commissural tracts (CC, VHC, AC, PC) for which the direction of the 1st eigenvector was greater than 45from the left-right axis of the brain were excluded from those ROIs. This same direction constraint defined the border between the corpus callosum and the immediately inferior dorsal fornix (whose fibers run in a predominately anteroposterior direction). The dorsal fornix extended anteriorly to the point where the white matter began to visibly separate from the inferior surface of the corpus callosum, at which point the white matter was assigned to the fornix ROI. An observer blinded to the age and genotype of the mice made minor adjustments to the ROIs to fill in any holes or smooth out any irregular contours that may have resulted from the automated process. Examples of the resulting ROIs for two brains are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe diffusion indices (RA, D mean , λ  , and λ  ) were calculated for each brain and white matter ROI as the mean of each measure across the pixels in the ROI. We also computed the area of each ROI (as the number of pixels in the ROI times pixel size), and the length of each CC ROI, defined as the Euclidean distance between its most anterior and posterior pixels. Finally, as a quality control measure, we computed the SNR of each ROI (by averaging the SNR values of the ROI from each of the three T2-weighted images with no diffusion weighting). Measures for each ROI were analyzed using twoway ANOVA with genotype and age as factors, followed by post hoc t tests. We used a slightly conservative value of P b 0.01 as our threshold for statistical significance (for both the ANOVA and post hoc t tests), in order to partially control for multiple statistical comparisons. However, the use of a more liberal P b 0.05 threshold yielded similar conclusions.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "The corpus callosum (CC) and ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) were the only fiber tracts that demonstrated significant changes in the diffusion indices due to either genotype or age. Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of genotype on RA in both the CC (F(1,47)  8.9, P  0.004) and VHC (F(1,47)  10.4, P  0.002),4 due to small decreases in RA (2-6) in the APPsw mice at all ages (Fig. 2). These decreases were not large enough to be visually apparent in RA maps (Fig. 1). For both structures, no particular age exhibited significantly reduced RA in the APPsw mice relative to age-matched controls, as determined by post hoc t tests (Table 1). ANOVA also indicated an effect of age on RA in VHC (F(2,47)  7.0, P  0.002) due to an increase in RA with age in both the transgenic and control mice (Fig. 2). There were no other significant effects of genotype, age, or their interaction on the diffusion indices (RA, D mean , λ  , or λ  ) for any of the white matter tracts examined (P N 0.03). Altogether, while some white matter alterations in the CC and VHC of APPsw mice were observed (as evidenced by small decreases in diffusion anisotropy), the diffusion indices provided no evidence of progressive changes in the white matter of brains from APPsw mice relative to control mice.\nThe most prominent differences observed in this study were in the apparent area of the corpus callosum, where a highly significant effect of genotype on the area of the CC ROI was noted (F(1,47)  29.4, P b 0.0001). Decreases in the area of the CC of 17, 17, and 6 were measured in APPsw mice at 12, 15, and 17 months, respectively. These reductions were significant in post hoc t tests for the 12 and 15, but not 17-month-old mice (Table 1). For all of the other white matter ROIs, the effects of genotype and age on ROI areas were nonsignificant. The length of the CC was slightly reduced at all ages for the transgenic mice (genotype: F(1,47)  7.8, P  0.008), but this reduction was small (2-6) and not significant for any specific age group. Thus, the reduction in the area of the CC in the APPsw mice at 12 and 15 months was not a consequence of a decrease in the length of the CC at those ages.\nFurther investigation revealed small differences in MR signal intensity in the CC of APPsw mice, at the same ages that differences in the area of the CC were observed. The CC was the only ROI that exhibited a significant effect of genotype on SNR (calculated from the three T2-weighted images with no diffusion weighting; F(1,47)  7.9, P  0.007). Analysis of the constituent signal and noise components of SNR revealed that the SNR changes in the CC were due to changes in the signal intensity of the CC, and not due to changes in the estimated background noise. The mean signal intensity in CC was 6 larger in the APPsw mice at 12 and 15 months (P  0.003 and 0.04, respectively, in t tests), but only 2.4 Fig. 1. Left: White matter ROIs superimposed on T2-weighted images from a 17-month-old control (top) and APPsw (bottom) mouse. The dorsal fornix (DF) is outlined in gray to help distinguish this ROI from the other adjacent fiber tracts. Right: Grayscale maps of relative anisotropy (RA) from the same two mice, with ROIs again superimposed. RA is a dimensionless quantity that ranges between 0 (isotropic diffusion; black) and ffiffi ffi 2 p (highly anisotropic diffusion along a single direction; white). The mice selected had a mean RA in the corpus callosum (CC) and ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) that was close to the mean RA for each structure across their respective age group. Scale bar is 1 mm. larger in the APPsw mice at 17 months (P  0.4). Area of the CC was negatively correlated with mean signal intensity in the CC for the 15-month-old mice (Pearsons r  -0.75, P b 0.001, n  18) and trended toward correlation in the 12-month-old mice (r  -0.46, P  0.06, n  17). These increases in T2weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of APPsw mice at 12 and 15 months of age could have influenced the determination of the border of the corpus callosum, and thus complicate the interpretation of the apparent callosal area differences between APPsw and control mice at these same ages (see Corpus callosum morphometry).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our findings with ex vivo DTI indicate that the corpus callosum and ventral hippocampal commissure of amyloid plaque-bearing APPsw mice display a small degree of white matter alteration relative to age-matched controls, as evidenced by decreases (6) in the anisotropy of water diffusion in these fiber tracts. There was no significant effect of genotype on mean diffusivity (D mean ), axial diffusivity (λ  ), or radial diffusivity (λ  ) for any of the examined midline white matter tracts. The decrease in diffusion anisotropy in the CC and VHC was already present at the earliest age examined (12 months), and the magnitude of this decrease did not increase at subsequent ages (15 and 17 months). Thus, there was no evidence in this cross-sectional study that white matter degenerated in a progressive manner between the ages of 12 and 17 months.",

    "DTI studies of white matter integrity in APP mice": {
      "text": "Other studies, using in vivo DTI, have observed larger changes in the white matter of transgenic mouse models of brain amyloidosis. In PDAPP mice, Song et al. (2004) measured significant decreases in RA (16-33), and increases in radial diffusivity (29-74) and mean diffusivity (20-34) in multiple white matter tracts of amyloid plaque-bearing (15 months old) mice relative to age-matched controls, with the largest differences occurring in the corpus callosum. In a different cross-sectional study examining middle-age APPsw mice at 4 different ages, Sun et al. (2005b) observed reductions in axial diffusivity (up to 15) in multiple white matter tracts of APPsw mice at the ages of 12, 16, and 18 months, but no change in 8 month-old APPsw mice (relative to age-matched controls). In that study, the only fiber tract that exhibited a significant effect of genotype on RA or radial diffusivity was the corpus callosum, where RA decreased (14-22) and radial diffusivity increased (15-31) in 16-18-month old APPsw mice. The present study, in comparison to Sun et al. (2005b), measured smaller reductions in diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum of APPsw mice at comparable ages, and detected no effect of genotype on axial or radial diffusivity for any of the white matter tracts examined.\nNotably, the observed changes in water diffusion in white matter were smaller in the present study and Sun et al. (2005b), both using the same strain of APPsw mice, than those reported in Song et al. (2004) for PDAPP mice. Furthermore, in PDAPP mice, the pattern of diffusivity changes appears to be more consistent across multiple white matter tracts than in APPsw mice. Thus, these two transgenic strains appear to differ appreciably in their degree of white matter abnormality. Additional support for such a strain difference is the fact that we found no appreciable change in the anteroposterior length of the CC ROI at any age, which is in contrast to reductions in length of 20 or more that are evident in PDAPP mice at ages as early as 40 days (Gonzalez-Lima et al., 2001;Redwine et al., 2003). Several factors, including the relative levels of total Aβ, Aβ 1-40 vs. Aβ 1-42 , transgene integration site, and genetic backgrounds, could contribute to the apparent differences between these two mouse lines.\nThere are several possible sources for the less-pronounced white matter alterations in the present study relative to Sun et al. (2005b). For example, while both studies examined the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, the specific portion of these tracts that was imaged and quantified differed across the two studies. The present study sampled only the midline of these tracts (using a midsagittal slice), whereas Sun et al. (2005b) included portions of these tracts lateral to the midline (using coronal slices). A more likely possible source of differences is that the present study performed DTI using formalin-fixed ex vivo brains, which was motivated by a desire to collect highquality diffusion tensor data in the absence of potential motionrelated image artifacts. Formalin fixation induces protein crosslinking that alters diffusion by restricting the motion of water, and thus reducing the magnitude of water diffusion. However, this decrease in diffusion occurs proportionally in all directions, so that diffusion anisotropy in white matter is unchanged after fixation in normal brains (Guilfoyle et al., 2003;Sun et al., 2003). Other studies have similarly concluded that formalinfixation has a minimal impact on DTI-derived estimates of myocardial fiber orientation (Chen et al., 2003;Holmes et al., 2000). Diffusion anisotropy has also been shown to be unaffected following formalin fixation in injured white matter in a mouse stroke model (Sun et al., 2005a). Nevertheless, this latter finding may not generalize to white matter alterations specific to other mouse models. Thus, a differential effect of fixation on diffusion anisotropy in APPsw mice (vs. control brains) remains a possible source of the differences between the present ex vivo results and the in vivo results reported in Sun et al. (2005b). Finally, the differences between the two studies may simply be a consequence of biological variability in the degree of β-amyloid pathology in APPsw transgenic mice of the same age (Callahan et al., 2001). In light of these hypotheses, our recommendation is that future DTI studies with APP mice utilize an in vivo study design to avoid any potential fixation-related alterations in DTI measures of white matter integrity. Subsequent ex vivo DTI on the same mice could definitively establish whether fixation influences apparent white matter integrity in the chosen mouse model. Additionally, complete (or nearly complete) spatial coverage of the fiber tracts of interest would be valuable, so that any existing regional variations in fiber tract integrity can be captured. Finally, a within animal, longitudinal study design would help reduce the possible influence of interanimal biological variability in β-amyloid pathology.\nIn our (cross-sectional) study, there was no progressive change in white matter integrity over the ages that amyloid plaque burden is known to increase dramatically in APPsw mice (Callahan et al., 2001;Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). Similarly, in Sun et al. (2005b), DTI differences between control and transgenic mice did not increase progressively with increasing age beyond 12 months, and the DTI measures of corpus callosum integrity did not correlate very well with Aβ plaque load measured in either the corpus callosum, hippocampus, or cortex. The lack of correlation between Aβ deposition and DTI changes by in vivo MR that we reported previously (Sun et al., 2005b) led us to exclude histopathological analysis in the present study. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that Sun et al. (2005b) found evidence of white matter changes only in plaquebearing mice (aged 12 months or more) and not in younger, non plaque-bearing animals (8 months old). These results suggest that the observed DTI changes in both the present study and Sun et al. (2005b) may be related to early plaque deposition, but that the subsequent dramatic increase in deposited Aβ does not lead to large additional changes in white matter integrity in APPsw mice.",

    "Corpus callosum morphometry": {
      "text": "With the exception of the corpus callosum, we found no evidence suggestive of atrophy or shrinkage of white matter tracts at the midline of APPsw mice. In the corpus callosum, callosal area in APPsw mice was reduced by 17 at the ages of 12 and 15 months, which is similar to the degree of callosal atrophy observed in AD patients with moderate dementia (Hampel et al., 1998;Pantel et al., 1999). The length of the corpus callosum at these same ages exhibited only small (5) reductions (that were not statistically significant between APPsw and control mice), indicating that a decrease in thickness was the predominant contributor to the area reductions. These data are in agreement with a recent report by Delatour et al. (in press) who observed decreases of corpus callosum thickness, but no change in length, in 24-month-old doubly transgenic APPPS1 mice hemizygous APP751 with both the Swedish (K670N, M671L) and London (V717I) mutations crossed with homozygous M146L PS1 transgenic mice as compared to the PS1 transgenic animals. Additionally, amyloid load in the APPPS1 mice did not correlate with the morphological changes in the corpus callosum or other white matter tracts. Thus, in both APPPS1 and APPsw mice, there appear to be changes in white matter tracts, detected by morphological techniques (Delatour et al., in press) or DTI (Sun et al., 2005b), that do not correlate with amyloid plaque load. Possible sources of the decrease in corpus callosal area in APPsw mice at 12 and 15 months in the present study include a reduction in collateral crossing axons, an effect of Aβ on glial cell function, or developmental abnormalities arising from the mutant APP gene or other gene integration events. At 17 months, the decrease in callosal area in APPsw mice relative to control mice was only 6. This reduced difference was due primarily to increased area in 17 monthold APPsw mice relative to the younger APPsw mice, since callosal area in control mice was nearly identical at all three ages. Although speculative, this increase in area at 17 months in the APPsw mice may be indicative of histopathology such as axonal swelling in the corpus callosum at a more advanced stage of amyloidosis.\nWe caution, however, that interpretation of the decreases in corpus callosal area in 12 and 15 month-old APPsw mice (relative to control mice) is complicated by our observation of an increase in callosal signal intensity in APPsw mice at these same ages. While this increase in the raw MR signal of the corpus callosum was small (6 in the T2-weighted images with no diffusion weighting), it is potentially relevant because white matter tracts were identified using a semi-automated procedure based on the signal intensity of the T2-weighted images, for which white matter generally has lower signal than gray matter. Thus, increases in MR signal in the corpus callosum could have resulted in a slight inward contraction of its apparent border, and hence a reduced apparent area. In T2-weighted images in human AD patients, hyperintense white matter is frequently observed adjacent to the ventricles and in deep white matter (Barber et al., 1999;Hirono et al., 2000), although we are unaware of any reports of such signal increases specific to the corpus callosum (notably, Hampel et al. (1998) explicitly looked for signal hyperintensity in the corpus callosum of AD patients and found none). Furthermore, Helpern et al. (2004) observed no change in the T2 of the corpus callosum of 16-23-month-old doubly transgenic PS1APP mice relative to nontransgenic control mice. Thus, existing literature provides no precedent for MR signal increases in the corpus callosum of either AD patients or APP transgenic mice. Clearly, additional studies are necessary to determine whether APPsw mice exhibit reproducible differences in corpus callosal area andor T2, and if so, the physiological source of these alterations.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "We measured small reductions in diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum and ventral hippocampal commissure of APPsw mice relative to age-matched control mice. Other midline white matter tracts exhibited no changes in fiber tract integrity. The data indicate that the magnitude of white matter change assessed by ex vivo DTI in formalin-fixed APPsw brains is smaller than what has been reported in vivo in the same strain of mice. Future studies using diffusion-based measures as endpoints in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis should be performed in vivo. Additionally, a longitudinal, within animal study design that includes young mice will help establish definitively the overall time-course of age-dependent white matter changes. Some previous studies using volumetric or diffusion-based endpoints have observed differences in old APP transgenic mice that were absent in younger APP mice (ranging from 40 days to 8 months old; Mueggler et al., 2004;Redwine et al., 2003;Song et al., 2004;Sun et al., 2005b;Sykova et al., 2005). However, we are aware of no studies using such endpoints in APP transgenic mice that have reported progressive changes over multiple ages during the time-period that Aβ concentration or plaque burden increases dramatically. Establishing such a progression would greatly enhance the validity and utility of such measures as noninvasive biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of anti-Aβ therapies in mouse models. Other magnetic resonance approaches, such as imaging of plaque deposition directly (Higuchi et al., 2005;Jack et al., 2004;Lee et al., 2004;Wadghiri et al., 2003), or perhaps spectroscopic measurement of metabolic profile (Marjanska et al., 2005;von Kienlin et al., 2005), may yield better noninvasive markers of progressive amyloid pathology.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To test the hypothesis that depressive symptoms correlate with Alzheimers disease (AD) type changes in CSF and structural and functional imaging including hippocampus volume, cortical thickness, white matter lesions, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patient with subjective (SCI) and mild (MCI) cognitive impairment. Method: In 60 patients, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The subjects underwent MRI, 18F-FDG PET imaging, and lumbar CSF extraction. Results: Subjects with depressive symptoms (n  24) did not have more pathological AD biomarkers than non-depressed. Uncorrected there were trends towards larger hippocampal volumes (P  0.06), less orbital WM damage measured by DTI (P  0.10), and higher orbital glucose metabolism (P  0.02) in the depressed group. The findings were similar when SCI and MCI were analyzed separately. Similarly, in patients with pathological CSF biomarkers (i.e., predementia AD, n  24), we found that correlations between scores on GDS and CSF Aß42 and P-tau indicated less severe AD-specific CSF changes with increasing depression. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are common in SCIMCI, but are not associated with pathological imaging or CSF biomarkers of AD. Depression can explain cognitive impairment in SCIMCI or add to cognitive impairment leading to an earlier clinical investigation in predementia AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Depression and dementia are common syndromes with considerable impact on patients and caregivers. Lifetime prevalence of depression has recently been estimated to about 13 worldwide and 19 in the United States (1). At present more than 30 million people worldwide are estimated to suffer from Alzheimerss disease (AD), the most common disorder causing dementia, a number expected to raise considerably the next decades (2). Among known risk factors for dementia are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (3) and depression (1).\nEarly detection of AD using biomarkers reflecting disease progression is important. At present, there is solid evidence for biomarkers including traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), amyloid PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (4), and more recently also for indices derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (5,6). Based on these findings, criteria for MCI due to AD, including biomarkers, have been proposed (4). In addition, the term subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) has received attention as a potential prodromal state of AD occurring before MCI (7,8). Depression has been shown to be a common feature in SCI, MCI, and AD dementia (9)(10)(11). In a recent review (12), frequencies of comorbid MCI and depression in hospital based populations varied considerably, but the median frequency was shown to be as high as 44.\nThe mechanisms underlying the association between depression and AD are not known. There is some evidence from autopsy-studies that AD-type pathology are more pronounced in patients with comorbid depression or a lifetime history of major depression (13,14), but other studies have not supported this hypothesis (9). Even less is known about the mechanisms underlying depression in predementia AD.\nSeveral studies have explored how biomarkers typically associated with AD are related to depression in non-demented and demented middle-aged and old people. Findings from amyloid imaging studies have been inconclusive, and CSF studies have not found any association between AD pathology and depression (9), not even in depressed patients with primary dementia (15). In contrast, reduced hippocampal volume has been consistently observed in major depressive disorders (16) and functional neuroimaging studies, including FDG-PET, have reported that frontal hypometabolism is associated with depression in AD (17,18) and MCI (19). However, at what stage hippocampal atrophy and frontal affection occur in the course of depression and their association with depression and cognitive impairment in AD is uncertain. In addition, DTI studies have shown lower anisotropy (arguably construed as more white matter damage) in frontal and temporal white matter tracts to be associated with depression (20). This supports the hypothesis that distinctive regional networks play a central role in depressive symptomatology and that frontotemporal subcortical neuronal projections are essential.\nTaken together, depressive symptoms are common and early features of AD often associated with frontal dysfunction, but disease mechanisms are unclear. Depression might be related to the brain changes associated with AD, but it may also reflect a secondary psychological reaction to the functional impairment associated with neurodegenerative disease, result from comorbid chronic ischemic disease or independently imitate cognitive impairment (pseudodementia). Further, depression has been described at AD stages preceding dementia, although criteria encompassing biomarkers and imaging excluding coexisting ischemic disease were not always employed (21). We recently found that cognitive complaints in patients with SCI and MCI were associated with minor depressive symptoms, but not CSF biomarkers and that depressive symptoms only to a limited extent were associated with objective cognitive impairment (10).\nTo investigate these relationships further, we therefore included patients with SCI and MCI from a hospital based memory clinic. Patients completed lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, MRI including DTI, FDG-PET, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (22). Participants are part of the same cohort and largely overlapping with included patients in a recent study (10).",

      "text": "Patients with SCI or MCI were recruited consecutively from referrals to a university-hospital-based memory clinic between 2006 and 2013 (6,10). Inclusion criteria for both groups were age 40-79 and impaired cognition (SCI or MCI) for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were impaired activities of daily living (i.e., dementia), a previous diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder (psychosis), cancer, drug abuse, solvent exposure, anoxic brain damage, including clinical stroke andor cerebral infarction on imaging, or other severe physical disease which may influence cognition.\nPatients fulfilling ICD-10 criteria for a major depressive episode after a clinical interview in accordance with ICD-10 criteria and guidelines were excluded, as this is inconsistent with a diagnosis of MCI. Patients who fulfilled any of the criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies or frontotemporal dementia (23,24) were also excluded.",

    "Clinical assessment": {
      "text": "SCI and MCI were defined as the second (SCI) and third (MCI) stages of the Global Deterioration Scale (25,26). Global Deterioration Scale staging was determined after a clinical interview and the following screening tests: Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (27), stepwise comparative status analysis (STEP) parameters 13-20 (28); I-Flex (fluency, interference, and numeral-letter items) (28) and Cognistat (29) (memory, including cued recall, and executive functions). In addition, the clinical dementia rating (CDR) (30) was administered by a trained rater based on an interview with the patient and a relative. This method of determining cognitive stage is in agreement with a previous study (31).\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (32) with 56 as cut off, a valid and reliable measure of depression in the elderly (33,34) including populations with MCI (35). The Geriatric Depression Scale was applied as a screening method to assess potentially relevant clinical depressive symptoms. Thus, patients with Geriatric Depression Scale scores above cutoff (i.e., 6 points or more), not fulfilling ICD-10 criteria for major depression, were diagnosed with minor depression and included in the group with depressive symptoms (n  24). Patients with 5 points or less were included in the group without depressive symptoms (n  36).\nA composite cerebrovascular risk score was made consisting of six items (smoking, diabetes, hypertension (i.e., blood pressure above 140 90 mmHg on two or more occasions andor use of antihypertensiva), hypercholesterolemia (i.e., total cholesterol above 7 mmoll or use of anticholesterol agents), hyperhomocysteinemia (i.e., above 15 lmoll) and known cerebrovascular disease (other than stroke) and family history of cerebrovascular disease). The total cerebrovascular burden in the individual patient was thus assessed on a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 indicated no burden and 6 indicated maximum burden of disease. To adjust for potential confounding of cerebrovascular disease, we also included analysis of white matter (WM) lesions (WML).",

      "text": "CSF. After lumbar puncture, CSF AD biomarkers (Ab42, T-tau, P-tau) were analyzed according to protocol and as previously described (36). For CSF to be assessed as pathological, either Ab42 andor P-tau had to be outside the specified reference area.\nMRI. MRI scans were obtained using a Siemens Espree 1.5 T system, one MPRAGE sequence was acquired (TRTETIFA  24003.6510008, matrix  240 9 192), 160 sagittal slices, thickness  1.2 mm, in-plane resolution of 1 mm 9 1.2 mm. The protocol also included 2D axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with the following parameters: TRTE TI  134201212500, 36 slices, spaced at 3.0, and 3.9 mm thick.\nThe pulse sequences for DTI were b  750; 12 directions repeated five times; 5 b 0 -values per slice, TR  6100 ms, TE  117 ms, number of slices: 30, slice thickness: 3 mm (gap 1.9 mm), in-plane resolution: 1.2 9 1.2 mm 2 , bandwidth: 840 Hz pixel.\nThe Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library version 4.1 was used for DTI analyses and calculations. Initially, FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool (37) was used for affine registrations of each DTI volume to the low-b (b  0) image.\nFractional anisotropy (FA) and eigenvalue maps were created. Radial diffusivity (DR) is defined as the mean of eigenvalue 2 and 3. Tract-based spatial statistics (38) was used for voxel-wise statistical analysis of the DTI variables (FA, DR). FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox was used to create DTI images by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data, and Software Library versions Brain Extraction Tool was used for subsequent brain extraction. All subjects FA data were then aligned into a common space using a non-linear registration tool (FMRIB), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field (39). Further, the mean FA image was created and thinned to create a FA skeleton that represents the centers of all tracts common to the group. Each subjects aligned FA data were then projected onto this skeleton and the resulting data fed into voxel-wise cross-subject statistics. DR data were then extracted from each subject according to the skeletonized FA map. Moreover, WM ROIs based on the FreeSurfer WM parcellations were extracted for FA and DR: The FSL FMRIB FA template (to which every subjects FA volume initially was registered) was co-registered to the standard space T1 volume MNI152, which subsequently went through the FreeSurfer processing stream to create a volume with WM parcellations. The processing stream includes segmentation of the subcortical WM and deep gray matter volumetric structures (40) and parcellation of the cortical surface (41) according to a previously published parcellation scheme (42). This labels cortical sulci and gyri, and thickness values are calculated in the ROIs. Based on the cortical parcellation, WM in the gyrus underneath each cortical label was identified. Each WM voxel within a gyrus was labeled according to the label of the nearest cortical voxel. Deep WM was not assigned to a particular cortical area, with a 5 mm distance limit. The registration between the FA template and the MNI152 volume was applied to the volume with the WM parcellations, and the resulting volume was used to extract the skeletonized DR data from each WM ROI.\nDR and FA were determined in WM ROIs using tract-based spatial statistics and whole brain DTI analysis (with threshold-free cluster enhancement to correct for multiple comparisons) was used to compare participants with and without depressive symptoms.WML were assessed using the method published by Fazekas (43) by one reviewer with good test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.8 and 0.9 for periventricular and subcortical WM lesions respectively).\nTo reduce interindividual variation due to head size, relative hippocampal volume was computed (per mille of total intracranial volume). All other morphometric ROI measures were thickness, and correction for head size is not appropriate. Measurements were averaged between hemispheres.\nFDG-PET scanning and analyses. 18F-FDG PET CT imaging was performed with a Siemens Biograph 16 PETCT scanner (Siemens Healthcare). Subjects fasted for at least 4 h prior to imaging (water only), and plasma glucose had to be 8 mmoll for FDG to be injected. After 10 min rest with eyes closed, subjects had an intravenous bolus of 200 À 10 MBq 18F-FDG injected and rested for 45-60 min before scanning. The PET acquisition was performed in 3D mode with one single axial position, duration 15 min. Attenuation and scatter corrections were performed. The images were reconstructed by an iterative technique (five iterations, eight subsets), using a Gaussian smoothing filter with full width at half maximum of 3.5 mm, zoom 1. The image format was 256 9 256. For each subject, FDG-PET frames were registered to the corresponding intensity-normalized MRI volume. PET activity was averaged within each ROI defined on the MRI and normalized to activity within the brainstem. Age, gender and cortical thickness were regressed out of all variables and the standardized residuals were used in further analyses. Measurements were averaged between hemispheres.",

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality was used to assess the distribution of depression scores and parameters of CSF, MRI, WM lesions, cerebrovascular risk factors and FDG-PET. For group comparison, independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi-square test, Pearson or Spearman correlations were used as appropriate (Table 1).\nFor further analyses, Hippocampus volume, cortical thickness, DTI and FDG-PET variables were adjusted for age and sex by a linear regression model. PET variables were in addition adjusted for cortical thickness. Residuals of a linear regression model were used for further analyses. As most of these variables are likely to be highly correlated, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed for simultaneous comparison with cognitive impairment (SCI or MCI) as factors in the model together with depressednon-depressed (independent variables). The assumptions of MANO- VA were assessed by performing Levenes test for homogeneity of variance in each variable, multivariate boxs test for equality of covariance matri-ces, and the Bartletts test for sphericity of correlation matrix. Wilks Lambda statistics was calculated to assess the difference in dependent variables between the depressed and non-depressed patients. Post hoc comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Analyzes stratified by CSF were defined as secondary and were performed by including CSF (pathological or not) in addition to cognitive classification (SCI or MCI) as factors into the MANOVA model together with depressednon-depressed (independent variables) and interaction between the two. Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests was applied for primary analyses only.\nStatistical analyses were performed by SPSS version 20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were two-sided.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our main aim was to find neurobiological correlates of mild depressive symptoms in people with SCI and MCI, focusing on AD-related biomarkers, to provide insights into common mechanisms of depression and AD. Our results suggest that AD-type brain changes are not associated with symptoms of depression in SCI and MCI. These findings did not differ when SCI and MCI were assessed separately or when we studied only those with pathological CSF AD markers, indicating that in predementia AD, mild depressive symptoms are not associated with pathological AD changes.\nIn contrast, we found a tendency to less pronounced changes in those with depression. Taken together, our findings indicate that depressive symptoms are driving the cognitive symptoms. This is consistent with our previous findings that cognitive complaints in patients with SCI and MCI are associated with minor depressive symptoms (10). Similarly, Kramberger et al. (15) recently showed that CSF AD biomarkers are not related to depression in SCI and MCI.\nLongitudinal studies in people without AD have found that the severity of baseline WMLs predict depression at follow-up examination (44). This is in accord with the vascular depression hypothesis that states an association between depression and WMLs as well as cerebovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking (45) in mainly frontal subcortical regions (46)(47)(48)(49). The vascular depression hypothesis, however, is challenged because chronic non-vascular illness also seems to be associated with late-life depression (50). We found that Fazekas and cerebrovascular scores were low and did not differ between those with and without depressive symptoms, suggesting that minor depressive symptoms in SCI and MCI are not driven by cerebrovascular disease. Other studies suggest that biological factors such as enlargement of the ventricles, reduced frontal lobe and hippocampus volumes, damaged WM tracts, and reduced blood flow to the prefrontal cortex (51) are important in non-AD depression, but how these changes interact with the development of cognitive impairment is unclear. A potential common link between depression and AD is the effect of chronic stress on the immune system including outflow of cytokines, influence on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA)-axis and secondary neurodegenerative effects on the hippocampus including effects on neurotrophic factors (52).\nRelatively few studies have explored the brain correlates of depression in people with AD, and sample sizes are often low and findings inconsistent. Frontal hypometabolism has been shown in several studies (17,18), and there is some evidence that dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, the APOE e4 genotype, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, genetic variations, activation of the HPAaxis and neuroinflammation are associated with depression (9,52). In a recent study, Lebedeva et al. (53) found that depressive symptoms in AD are associated with cortical thinning in temporal and parietal regions. Studies of cerebrospinal fluid, however, have not found any association between AD and depression (9,15).\nOf note, most studies have included people with dementia of mild or moderate severity, and very few studies have explored the brain correlates of depression in people with predementia AD. In the paper by Grambaite et al. (10) including 70 SCI MCI patients from the same cohort as the present study, depressive symptoms, but not CSF biomarkers, were significantly associated with cognitive complaints, which is in accord with previous studies. In addition, we found a tendency towards less pathological CSF biomarkers with increasing depression also when subjects with pathological CSF (predementia AD, n  24) were analyzed separately. This suggests that subjects with early stage AD and depressive symptoms seek help at the memory clinic earlier than those without depressive symptoms.\nAlso, major depression is inconsistent with a diagnosis of SCIMCI, and biological changes are to some extent believed to be proportional to the severity of depression. In minor depressive states psychosocial factors are more likely to cause and maintain depressive symptoms, with a subsequent higher tendency for symptoms to fluctuate, and the biological changes are thus probably less pronounced than in more advanced cases. This may in part explain why depressed patients in this SCI MCI cohort had less pathological AD biomarkers than non-depressed.\nThere is also evidence that treatment with antidepressants can increase hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis (54). In addition to our finding that the depressed have less neurodegenerative changes, past and present antidepressant use could be another explanation for the less hippocampal changes in depressed compared to nondepressed subjects. At baseline examination, only seven patients (five scored 6 points or more on the Geriatric Depression Scale) used antidepressants, but it is unlikely that this has significantly influenced the results. However, earlier use of antidepressants was not recorded. In contrast, a recent study found that antidepressant use in mild AD and dementia with Lewy bodies was associated with parahippocampal thinning (55) confirming that the neurobiology of antidepressants, including possible neuroprotective properties, is complex and at present unclear.\nThere are other possible explanations to cognitive impairment in SCI and MCI, including cerebrovascular disease and unspecific activation of the immune system, and future research should focus on how to differentiate between the different causes to provide more targeted treatment.",

    "Limitations and strengths": {
      "text": "It is difficult to detect small effect sizes when sample size is low, exposing the method to type II error.\nSubjects with major depression were excluded as it is inconsistent with a diagnosis of MCI. However, it is possible that we would have found biological correlates to depression if included patients were more depressed.\nSCI and MCI are heterogeneous states and dif- ferences between (minor) depressed and nondepressed subjects may have been masked by other overlapping conditions such as other dementia subtypes. On the other hand, the included patients fulfilled consensus criteria for SCIMCI and not any of the core or suggestive criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies or criteria consistent with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.\nA cross-sectional design is not optimal as depressive symptoms, in particular in minor depression, may fluctuate and not be present at follow-up examination. A longitudinal approach will help to clarify the association between AD markers and risk for future depression.\nTo conclude, the neural mechanisms underlying dementia and depressive disorders are complex, and clarification is important to improve future assessment, early intervention and treatment. Our findings suggest that in people with SCI and MCI, in particular in those with normal CSF or imaging, depression may explain the cognitive impairment. A thorough examination of depressive symptoms in memory clinic patients is therefore warranted. On the other hand, a subgroup of patients have both depressive symptoms and pathological AD biomarkers and may seek help at the memory clinic at an earlier stage than non-depressed. Our findings suggest that depression may add to cognitive impairment leading to an earlier clinical investigation in predementia AD.",

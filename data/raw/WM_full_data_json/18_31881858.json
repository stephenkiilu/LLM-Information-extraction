    "abstract": "Background: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) are associated with divergent differences in grey matter volume, white matter diffusion, and functional connectivity. However, it is unknown at what disease stage these differences emerge. Here, we investigate whether divergent differences in grey matter volume, white matter diffusion, and functional connectivity are already apparent between cognitively healthy carriers of pathogenic FTD mutations, and cognitively healthy carriers at increased AD risk. Methods: We acquired multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans in cognitively healthy subjects with (n39) and without (n36) microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) or progranulin (GRN) mutations, and with (n37) and without (n38) apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele. We evaluated grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry, white matter diffusion using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and region-to-network functional connectivity using dual regression in the default mode network and salience network. We tested for differences between the respective carriers and controls, as well as for divergence of those differences. For the divergence contrast, we additionally performed region-of-interest TBSS analyses in known areas of white matter diffusion differences between FTD and AD (i.e., uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor, and anterior thalamic radiation). Results: MAPTGRN carriers did not differ from controls in any modality. APOE4 carriers had lower fractional anisotropy than controls in the callosal splenium and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, but did not show grey matter volume or functional connectivity differences. We found no divergent differences between both carriercontrol contrasts in any modality, even in region-of-interest analyses.",

    "Background": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) are two of the most common causes of dementia 1234. In addition to distinct clinical features 56789, FTD and AD demonstrate different patterns of functional and structural neurodegeneration on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1011121314151617. Atrophy is more pronounced in FTD than in AD in frontotemporal areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, fronto-insula, and inferior frontal cortex 10,13,15. Conversely, AD patients have more atrophy in the occipital gyrus and precuneus than FTD patients 13. In terms of white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) alterations, FTD patients have reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) compared to AD patients in the uncinate fasciculi, forceps minor, and anterior thalamic radiation, whereas AD patients do not show FA decreases or RD increases compared to FTD patients 11,13141516. Furthermore, functional connectivity is inversely affected in FTD and AD. In FTD patients, functional connectivity with the salience network is disrupted, while functional connectivity with the default mode network is increased. Vice versa, functional connectivity with the default mode network is disrupted in AD patients, while functional connectivity with the salience network is increased 12,17.\nDespite these different patterns of neurodegeneration, the differentiation between FTD and AD is often demanding when patients first present in the memory clinic. For example, FTD patients may first present with memory deficits 18,19, and as such may be misdiagnosed as AD patients. Conversely, AD patients may be misdiagnosed as FTD patients due to the presentation of behavioural symptoms 20. Indeed, 13 of initial FTD diagnoses were corrected to AD after two years followup 21, while 10-30 of clinical FTD patients were found to have AD pathology upon autopsy 222324.The current criteria for behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) 5, and language FTD variants 6 lack specificity to distinguish early-stage FTD patients from early-stage AD patients 7. This diagnostic problem delays effective disease management 21,252627, and frustrates the development of new treatments. Considering that the potential of disease-modifying drugs is highest in the stage before atrophy occurs, the identification of early-stage dementia patients is crucial for patient selection in clinical trials 28.\nTo assess whether FTD-and AD-related pathological changes are present even before symptom onset, carriers of FTD and AD risk mutations have been studied using structural, diffusion-weighted, and functional MRI (fMRI). For example, mutations in microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT), progranulin (GRN), and repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) are known causes of genetic FTD. Presymptomatic carriers of these mutations have therefore been regularly used to investigate early-stage FTD-related pathology 2930313233. Similarly, mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and amyloid precursor protein are known causes of genetic AD. However, due to its higher prevalence, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4), the strongest risk factor for sporadic AD, has been more extensively used to study early-stage AD-related pathology 34353637383940414243.\nContrary to findings in clinical FTD and AD 11,13141516, differences in diffusion metrics associated with asymptomatic APOE4 39,4445464748495051 are more widespread than diffusion differences associated with asymptomatic MAPTGRN mutation carriers 32,33. Functional connectivity differences have also been shown in these asymptomatic groups 32,41. However, a comparison between these presymptomatic patterns of change in risk mutation carriers for FTD and AD is lacking, even though early-stage differences between these dementias may aid early differential diagnosis.\nTo this end, we investigated multimodal MRI in asymptomatic subjects at risk for FTD and AD. First, we aimed to replicate early carrier-control differences found between MAPTGRN mutation carriers and controls, and between APOE4 carriers and controls, respectively, by assessing whole-brain grey matter volume, white matter DTI measures, and functional connectivity in the default mode network and salience network. Secondly, we investigated whether MAPTGRN carrier-control differences diverged from APOE4 carrier-control differences, similar to FTD-AD differences. For the latter analysis, we additionally evaluated a priori selected white matter tracts known to be affected more strongly in FTD than AD (i.e., uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor, and anterior thalamic radiation). We hypothesised that the differences in grey matter volumes, DTI measures, and functional connectivity seen in FTD and AD patients 1011121314151617 may also be present to a smaller extent before symptomonset in risk mutation carriers.",

      "text": "Subjects were included retrospectively from studies carried out at the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), The Netherlands, and at the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Centre (FMRIB), Oxford, UK.\nThe Dutch sample included 39 MAPTGRN mutation carriers (11 MAPT, 28 GRN) and 36 controls, recruited from a pool of 160 healthy first-degree relatives of FTD patients with either MAPT or GRN mutation 32. Participants were considered asymptomatic in the absence of (1) behavioural, cognitive, or neuropsychiatric change reported by the participant or knowledgeable informant, (2) cognitive disorders on neuropsychiatric tests, (3) motor neuron disease signs on neurologic examination, and (4) other FTD 5,6 or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 52 criteria. Asymptomatic non-carriers from these families and the general population were assumed to have equal risk of developing dementia. MAPTGRN mutation carriers and controls were not tested for APOE4 alleles.\nData from 37 APOE4 carriers (30 apolipoprotein E ε3 ε4 heterozygotes, 7 apolipoprotein E ε4ε4 homozygotes) and 38 controls (all apolipoprotein E ε3ε3 homozygotes) were collected in Oxford from the general population in Oxfordshire and were selected to match the Dutch sample in terms of age and gender. Due to the limited sample size, it was not possible to match the groups education level. Middle-aged and elderly APOE4 carriers and controls underwent a pre-screening cognitive test (Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-revised version 39,40) to assure asymptomatic status. APOE4 carriers and controls were not tested for MAPTGRN mutations.\nIn both cohorts, participants were between 21 and 70 years old. A priori exclusion criteria included MRI contraindications, head injury, current or past neurologic or psychiatric disorders, (history of) substance abuse including alcohol, corticosteroid therapy, type I diabetes therapy, and memory complaints.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with regional regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was received from all participants, and ethical approval for data acquisition was provided by the Medical Ethical Committees in Rotterdam and Leiden for MAPTGRN data, and the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central -Oxford C for APOE4 data.

For voxel-wise analysis of these images, we used tract-based spatial statistics 58. After brain extraction, subjects individual FA images were transformed to standard space using FNIRT. A mean FA image then was created and thinned to generate a whole-brain mean FA skeleton, representing the centres of all white matter tracts common to all subjects. Individual aligned FA images were projected onto this skeleton for group analysis. Similar analyses were performed on MD, AxD, and RD maps using the spatial transformation parameters that were estimated in the FA analysis. For our region-of-interest analyses, we masked the whole-brain skeleton with the combined masks of the uncinate fasciculi, forceps minor, and the bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, which have been shown to differ between FTD and AD patients in terms of DTI metrics 11,13141516.",

      "text": "Pre-statistical processing of resting-state data consisted of motion correction 59, brain extraction, spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum, 4D grand-mean scaling and high-pass temporal filtering corresponding to a period of 150s (0 .007 Hz). Registration to MNI-152 standard space was carried out in two steps. We registered echo-planar images onto their respective T1-weighted structural images using FLIRT and Boundary-Based Registration 596061. Next, we used FNIRT to align T1-weighted structural images to MNI-152 standard space, and concatenated the resulting registration matrices to register echoplanar images directly to standard space. Next, we performed individual Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and voxel-wise intensity normalisation (i.e., by dividing all voxels by their time series mean values and multiplying by 10,000).\nWe used FMRIBs ICA-based X-noiseifier (FIX 626364) to clean up noise components and reduce rs-fMRI scan site bias. For a detailed description and validation of FIX as a multicentre bias reduction method, see Feis et al. (2015) 64. In short, we classified the individual ICA components of a subset of the subjects as signal, noise or unknown, trained the FIX classifier, and used a leave-oneout test to control the algorithms quality. All subjects data were then classified using the optimal threshold (i.e., 20true-positive rate 95.1, true-negative rate 91.4) and structured noise components were removed.\nAfter processing and application of FIX, rs-fMRI data were temporally concatenated and decomposed into 25 components using FSLs group-level ICA tool 656667, in order to identify large-scale patterns of functional connectivity. The resulting group-level ICA spatial maps were compared to previously described resting-state networks 6768697071, and we selected default mode network components and salience network components for dual regression analyses. The default mode network is disrupted in AD, and enhanced in FTD, while the salience network is disrupted in FTD and enhanced in AD 12,17. Components that included the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, medial pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus were regarded as parts of the default mode network. Components featuring the anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area and insula were considered linked to the salience network. We found three networks resembling the default mode network (e.g., the anterior, inferior and posterior default mode network, Fig. 1a-c) and two networks resembling the salience network (e.g., the anterior and posterior salience network, Fig. 1d-e). For these five resulting resting-state networks of interest, we performed dual regression to identify the subject-specific spatial maps corresponding to the resting-state networks of interest 37,72. First, the spatial maps derived from group-level ICA were used as a spatial regressor in each subjects rs-fMRI data to obtain subject-specific time series describing the temporal dynamics for each component (Additional file 1: Figure S1, step 1). Next, the time series found by spatial regression were used as a temporal regressor to find the voxels associated with those time series for each subject (Additional file 1: Figure S1, step 2). As such, we used the group-level ICA networks of interest to obtain subject-specific spatial maps that allow for voxel-wise comparison. Statistical analysis of region-to-network functional connectivity group differences was then carried out by testing for the functional connectivity between the five resting-state networks of interest and all other grey matter voxels.",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "Statistical analysis of grey matter volume, DTI features, and rs-fMRI data was performed using general linear models, including age and education as confound regressors. Additionally, we added a voxel-wise covariate for grey matter volume to the functional connectivity analyses. We tested for differences between, respectively, MAPTGRN mutation carriers and controls, and differences between APOE4 carriers and controls. Additionally, we tested for the differences between these respective carrier-control contrasts to evaluate whether these gene mutations have divergent effects on the brain in cognitively healthy carriers that might reflect early substrates of FTD or AD pathology. Since possible centre effects are equivalent for carriers and controls at each site, these effects cancel out when we compared the carrier-control effect at one site to the carrier-control effect at the other site. Consequently, unknown confounding factors such as scanner and population differences should have minimal influence on our results.\nPooling MAPT and GRN mutation carriers, and APOE4 heterozygotes and homozygotes in our carrier samples may have increased heterogeneity in our groups. To account for this possibility, we performed additional analyses with covariates encoding the difference between MAPT and GRN mutations, and between APOE4 heteroand homozygosity.\nVoxel-wise application of these general linear models to the data was performed using FSL randomise, a permutation-based non-parametric test (5,000 permutations). We set the family-wise error rate at 5 across space by using threshold-free cluster enhancement 73 in all analyses. The alpha level required for statistical significance was set at 0.025 for all imaging analyses, which corresponds to an alpha level of 0.05 in a two-sided ttest, since randomise performs the permutation equivalent of a one-sided t-test. Minimal cluster size for significant results was set at 10 voxels.\nSPSS version 24 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistics performed on non-imaging (demographic) variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed on Fig. 1 Resting-state networks. Maps illustrate the most informative slices of resting-state networks of interest that featured known default mode network and salience network regions and that were used for statistical testing after dual regression normally distributed continuous variables (age and education) and included Bonferroni post-hoc tests.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Differences in atrophy, white matter diffusion, and functional connectivity patterns have been repeatedly shown between FTD and AD patients 111213141516, and between asymptomatic mutation carriers at risk for these diseases and controls (e.g., MAPT and GRN mutation carriers 2930313233; APOE4 carriers 34353637383940414243). However, comparisons between groups at risk for FTD and groups at risk for AD have been lacking, even though early-stage differences between these dementias are key to improve on diagnostic standards. In this study, we aimed to replicate previously found differences in asymptomatic mutation carriers at risk for FTD and AD compared to their respective control groups. More importantly, we investigated whether carrier-control differences diverged, similar to the divergences that exist between FTD and AD. While we could replicate some of the previously reported fractional anisotropy reductions in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers, we found no evidence of divergence between MAPTGRN carrier-control differences and APOE4 carrier-control differences, even when restricting our DTI analysis to regions which are known to differ between FTD and AD patients. This may suggest that the neuroimaging biomarkers measured in this study are not sufficiently specific to differentiate between FTDrelated pathology and pathology possibly related to AD at this early stage.\nOur lack of differences between groups in grey matter volume were unsurprising. In asymptomatic risk mutation carriers, one would not expect dementia related atrophy unless the carrier would be close to symptom onset. Indeed, grey matter volume differences have not been reported in asymptomatic MAPTGRN mutation carriers 31,32, though reports in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers have been conflicting. While some groups report no grey matter volume differences in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers 35,39,40,43, others found reduced grey matter volume in the hippocampus 36,75, lingual gyrus 36, precuneus 36,76, insula 76, caudate nucleus, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus 75. These conflicting findings may in part result from methodological differences, sample sizes, and the different age ranges between studies. Since disease modifying treatments aim to prevent atrophy, one would ideally aim to diagnose dementia patients before atrophy occurs to maximise potential treatment effect. Accordingly, biomarker research should focus on detecting substrates of neurodegeneration that precede atrophy and that may be reversible by future disease modifying treatments. White matter diffusion analyses yielded areas of reduced FA in APOE4 carriers compared to controls in the splenium of the corpus callosum, and in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These results concur with previous reports in APOE4 carriers. FA reductions were most often reported in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi 39,4445464748495051, while FA differences in the corticospinal tract 39,495051 and superior longitudinal fasciculi 39,50,51 were less frequently reported. We found no diffusion differences in MAPTGRN mutation carriers compared to controls, in contrast to earlier work 32,33. However, this might be explained by differences in methodology. One study found significant FA reductions only within certain pre-specified tracts, and, similar to our current study, found no whole-brain differences 32. The other study found differences at p0.005 uncorrected for multiple comparisons across space. Our analyses were performed with a more restrictive significance level, as we corrected for multiple comparisons across space using threshold-free cluster enhancement, and used the statistical threshold appropriate for a two-sided test, which is not a standard procedure in neuroimaging 77. Interestingly, DTI alterations are larger in FTD patients than in AD patients 11,13141516, while preclinical alterations in APOE4 carriers 39,4445464748495051 are more widespread than in MAPTGRN mutation carriers 32,33. Recently, it has been postulated that white matter DTI differences in genetic FTD develop rather explosively in the years just prior to symptom onset 78,79. This might explain why in our sample, we found DTI differences in APOE4 carriers, but no DTI differences in MAPTGRN mutation carriers. Although there were FA reductions in APOE4 carriers compared to controls, the difference was not strong enough to result in a difference between the MAPTGRN carrier-control contrast and the APOE4 carrier-control contrast. We also performed region-ofinterest analyses in the uncinate fasciculi, forceps minor, or bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, which were found to have FA reductions and RD increases in FTD patients compared to AD patients 11,13141516. However, even in these regions of interest, we could not find DTI differences between the MAPTGRN carrier-control contrast and the APOE4 carrier-control contrast. As such, we could not conclude that MAPTGRN mutation carriership had a different effect on white matter diffusion metrics than APOE4 carriership.\nIt has been previously argued that the default mode network and the salience network are inversely correlated and both play a role in AD and FTD. Specifically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was reported to be reduced in AD patients and increased in FTD patients, whereas functional connectivity in the salience network was reported to be inversely affected: reduced in FTD patients and increased in AD patients 12,17. In asymptomatic APOE4 carriers, this inverse correlation was also shown. Functional connectivity with the default mode network was decreased and functional connectivity with the salience network was enhanced in APOE4 carriers compared to controls 41. In asymptomatic MAPT and GRN mutation carriers, functional connectivity was reduced in the salience network, but no differences in the default mode network were found 32. Based on these results, we hypothesised that functional connectivity in the default mode network and salience network would be ideal candidates to screen for early changes in asymptomatic risk carriers. However, we found no evidence of functional connectivity differences, either between the respective carrier and control groups or divergent differences between the carriercontrol contrasts. This might in part be a power issue but could also be explained by population and methodological differences. For example, our sample was on average younger and had a broader age range than the APOE4 sample investigated by Machulda et al. ( 2011) 41. Furthermore, we performed data-driven dual regression analyses, whereas both Machulda et al. (2011) 41 and Dopper et al. (2014) 32 performed seed-based analyses. While small seed areas are arbitrarily placed and may be subject to registration mismatch, dual regression networks are less sensitive to these issues due to their data-driven origin. Indeed, dual regression is amongst the best functional MRI analysis techniques in terms of test-retest reliability 80,81. Therefore, the most likely explanation of our functional connectivity results is that our groups were on average too far from symptom onset for functional connectivity alterations in the default mode network and salience network to robustly appear.\nStrengths of this study include its unique design to pick up differences between FTD-and AD-related pathology in asymptomatic populations, and the inclusion of control groups from both sites to deal with potential scan site bias. We performed specific region-of-interest analyses to increase power to find differences in DTI metrics. Furthermore, we used FIX 62,63 to clean up structured noise (e.g., motion, artefacts) from rs-fMRI data to reduce scanner-based functional connectivity differences 64 and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. To account for possible heterogeneity resulting from pooling MAPT and GRN mutation carriers, and APOE4 hetero-and homozygotes, we performed additional analyses including covariates for the different mutation types. The results of these analyses were very similar to our main results, suggesting that the effect of genetic heterogeneity in our main analyses was altogether limited. Limitations must also be considered. Firstly, differences in penetrance and age of onset exist between MAPT GRN and APOE4. MAPT and GRN mutations have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and are highly penetrant 82,83. On the other hand, APOE4 has a dose-dependent effect on lifetime AD risk. Heterozygous APOE4 carriers have an estimated lifetime risk for AD of approximately 25, while APOE4 homozygosity is associated with an estimated lifetime risk of around 55 84. Therefore, it is unlikely that all APOE4 carriers from our sample will develop AD, which reduced our power to detect AD-related differences. For the same reason, it cannot be entirely ruled out that some of the differences associated with the APOE4 carriers do not reflect presymptomatic AD-related pathology. Information on MAPTGRN mutation carriership was not available for APOE4 carriers and controls, and information on APOE4 carriership was not available for MAPTGRN mutation carriers and controls. Due to the infrequency of MAPT and GRN mutations, it is unlikely that APOE4 carriers or controls had an MAPT or GRN mutation. However, the frequency of the APOE4 allele in Caucasian populations is around 14 85, and it is likely that some of the MAPT and GRN mutation carriers and controls had an APOE4 allele. As MAPTGRN mutation carriers and controls were from the same families, the frequency of the APOE4 alleles within these groups was most likely similar. Therefore, the effect of APOE4 on our MAPTGRN analyses is presumably small. The broad age range in our groups presents another limitation. FTD-or AD-related pathology may be absent or present in a lesser degree in young mutation carriers than in older carriers, who are closer to symptom-onset. However, even though a broad age range was present in our sample, physiological brain aging effects are unlikely to have influenced our results. The four groups were matched for age, and age was added as confound covariate to the model. Therefore, physiological brain aging effects should be equally distributed across groups and were accounted for in the model. In order to increase power, future neuroimaging research comparing FTD-and AD-related pathology in asymptomatic risk groups should contain clinical follow-up and conversion information, which will enable the inclusion of a time to onset variable to the model.\nDementias are relentlessly progressive diseases for which no adequate treatments currently exist, and differentiation between various forms of dementia is clinically challenging. Recently, MRI has shown different patterns of grey matter atrophy, DTI alterations and functional connectivity differences in AD and FTD patients 11121314151617. However, early differential identification of at-risk groups is key to study pathophysiological processes, develop disease-modulating drugs and, eventually, identify patient groups that may benefit from these treatments. In the current study, we could not find differences suggestive of divergent pathways of underlying FTD and AD pathology in asymptomatic risk mutation carriers.",

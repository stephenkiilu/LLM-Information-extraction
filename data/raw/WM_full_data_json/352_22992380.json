    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) detects microstructural changes of the cerebral white matter in Alzheimers disease (AD). The use of DTI for the diagnosis of AD in a multicenter setting has not yet been investigated. We used voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and grey matter volumes from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data of 137 AD patients and 143 healthy elderly controls collected across 9 different scanners. We compared different univariate analysis approaches to model the effect of scanner, including a linear model across all scans with a scanner covariate, a random effects model with scanner as a random variable as well as a voxel-based metaanalysis. We found significant reduction of fractional anisotropy and significant increase of mean diffusivity in core areas of AD pathology including corpus callosum, medial and lateral temporal lobes, as well as fornix, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and prefrontal lobe white matter. Grey matter atrophy was most pronounced in medial and lateral temporal lobe",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has frequently been employed in the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD) based on regional pattern of brain atrophy 1. Hippocampus and entorhinal cortex volumetry have shown an accuracy of 80 to 90 in the discrimination between AD patients and healthy control subjects in monocenter studies 234. Studies using automated voxel-based and deformation-based analysis with univariate or multivariate analysis approaches have shown similar diagnostic accuracy 5678. First projects are under way to implement voxel-based automated processing routines in diagnostic expert systems to support the radiological reading of cerebral MRI scans. However, the implementation of such methods requires that diagnostic accuracy is stable across different scanners and platforms. First multicenter studies have shown reliable group discrimination between AD patients and controls based on MR volumetric markers across different scanners, including hippocampus volume as well as overall brain atrophy using deformation-based morphometry 9.\nIn addition to volumetric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has increasingly been used to detect microstructural brain differences in AD 10. DTI allows determining the integrity of subcortical fiber tracts using scalar markers of overall diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy such as mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as tracing of individual fiber tracts 11. The rationale for the application of DTI for the diagnosis of AD is the pathophysiological concept of disease progression including an early involvement of synaptic and axonal neuronal structures in late myelinating brain regions 12. Many studies have explored the regional pattern of fiber tract differences between AD dementia and controls 13141516171819202122, but only few studies have examined these patterns to determine the diagnostic accuracy of DTI for the discrimination between AD dementia and controls 232425. Recent studies using multivariate analysis to extract a characteristic pattern of fiber tract changes in AD patients compared to controls found similar accuracy of group discrimination between AD patients and controls of DTI compared to MRI volumetric markers 24,25. One study in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical at risk stage for AD dementia, has shown a higher diagnostic accuracy for hippocampus diffusivity compared to hippocampus volume in a small sample of 18 patients and 18 control subjects 23. A single center study using a combination of DTI and anatomical features from MRI yielded overall accuracy of 70 to discriminate 79 subjects with MCI from 200 healthy controls 26.\nThe clinical diagnostic utility of both volumetric and DTI derived measures is dependent upon the reliability when applied across different centers. Reliability of MRI volumetric measures when assessed across different scanners and platforms has been evaluated in a range of previous studies, including physical and clinical phantoms 272829. Variability has been shown to lie below 5 for grey matter volumetric measures, such as total cortical grey matter volume and hippocampus volume 29. In contrast, only few studies have investigated variability of DTI derived measures of fiber tract integrity 30,31. Using a physical and clinical DTI phantom within the framework of the European DTI study in Dementia (EDSD), we had found an at least 50 higher variability of FA measures compared to conventional grey matter volumetry across 14 different scanners employing 3 and 1.5 T machines 32. These data suggest that the effect of multicenter acquisition on diagnostic accuracy may be more pronounced for DTI than conventional MRI measures.\nSo far no study has compared diagnostic accuracy between different markers of diffusivity and cortical grey matter atrophy based on a multicenter data set in AD. Therefore, in the present study, we determined diagnostic accuracy between pattern of cortical grey matter atrophy and pattern of white matter diffusivity based on data of 137 AD patients and 143 controls recruited from 8 centers, representing 9 different scanners, within the EDSD framework. In order to address multicenter variability in the statistical analysis of group differences, we used different approaches of univariate analysis of overall pattern of brain atrophy and diffusivity, including pooled data analysis with scanner as covariate, hierarchical linear model with scanner as second level variable, and voxel-based meta-analysis across the different scanners. We compared the spatial pattern of group differences and diagnostic accuracies obtained through these different univariate approaches to control for the effect of multicenter acquisition. The data of this study, obtained comprising 1.5 and 3 Tesla machines with a variety of acquisition protocols, set the basis to determine multicenter reliability of both spatial pattern of brain atrophy and diffusivity as well as diagnostic accuracy across a wide range of scanner platforms. This will be important for the future implementation of MRI and DTI measures in diagnostic routines and scanner based expert systems aimed to support the radiological detection of early signs of AD.",

At present, the data bank includes 335 DTI and 335 structural MRI scans from patients with AD and healthy elderly subjects. Written informed consent was provided by all subjects, or their representatives. The study was approved by local ethics committees at each of the participating centers, and has been conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.\nDue to prominent ghosting artifacts in the DTI data, all data from one center were excluded from further analysis. Additionally, 13 of 26 DTI scans, 2 of 35 DTI scans, and 1 of 30 DTI scans from three other centers had to be excluded due to prominent artifacts in the data which were either due to folding, highfrequency inferences, an incorrectly set Inversion Time or heavy movement artifacts. Finally, one additional DTI data set had to be excluded from one center due to imperfect normalization of the DTI data during preprocessing, leaving 280 DTI and MRI scans for final analysis derived from 8 centers representing 9 MRI 3 20.6 (5.3) 28.8 (1.1) Years of education (SD) 4 10.2 (3.3) 13.1 (3.8) Semantic fluency (CERAD) 5 12.6 (5) 23.5 (6.3) Word list recall (CERAD) 5 1.7 (1.9) 8.1 (1.5) Figure recall (CERAD) 5 2.0 (2.4) 9.6 (1.8) Clock drawing test (according to 60) 5 3.4 (1) 1.1 (0.4)\n1 not significantly different between groups, χ 2  1.5, 1 df, p  0.22.\n2 significantly different between groups, T  3.92, 278 df, p  0.001. 3 significantly different between groups, Mann-Whitney-U  263, p  0.001. 4 significantly different between groups, T  -6.7, 271 df, p  0.001. 5 significantly different between groups, Mann-Whitney-U test, p  0.001 for all comparisons.\nscanners.

We first applied corrections for eddy currents and head motion. The skull was stripped using Brain Extraction Tool and the diffusion tensors were fitted to the data with DTIfit. FA and MD maps were computed subsequently, using the standard FSL protocol.\nFor deformation based analysis, MPRAGE data as well as the FA-and MD-maps were pre-processed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk spm) implemented in Matlab 7 (Mathworks, Natwick). In a first step, MPRAGE scans, FA-and MD-maps were manually aligned to place the anterior commissure at the origin of the three-dimensional Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate system. FA-and MD-maps were affinely aligned to the corresponding MPRAGE scans.\nFor spatial normalization, the VBM8 toolbox (Version 414, http:dbm.neuro.uni-jena.devbm8) 36 implemented in SPM8 was used to create a customized DARTEL template. To avoid a potential bias in favor of particular scanners, we used a random subsample of n  54 images, with the restriction to include scans from exactly 3 AD patients and 3 healthy controls from each of the 9 scanners. The template was used for high-dimensional DARTEL normalization of the MPRAGE scans as implemented in VBM8. The images were segmented into grey matter and white matter and transformed to MNI space applying modulation for non-linear components only. Deformation fields were derived which were applied to the spatially coregistered FA-and MD-maps, without applying modulation. We used a binary mask based on an averaged white matter image derived from the random sample of n  54 normalized images to exclude all voxels outside the white matter of the FA-and MD-maps.\nThe normalized grey matter and white matter segments as well as the masked FA-and MD maps from the previous step were smoothed using an 8 mm full width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel.",

Significant clusters were identified with at least 50 voxels passing the uncorrected threshold of p  0.001.  Second, we used a second level analysis with linear models of between group differences at the first level and a one-sample t-test of the between group effects across the 9 scanners at the second level. Significant clusters were identified with at least 50 voxels passing the uncorrected threshold of p  0.001.  Third, we used a voxel-based meta-analysis. In the first step, the t-statistics maps for the between group effects within each scanner were converted to correlation coefficient maps through the relation:\n, with r i,j  correlation coefficient, t i,j  t-value of the between groups effect for voxel i and scanner j, and df j  degrees of freedom of the between groups t-statistic for scanner j.\nThe voxel-wise r-values for each scanner were then Fishers Z-transformed, according to:\n, with Z i,j  Fishers Z value and r i,j  correlation coefficient for voxel i and scanner j.\nThe voxel-wise Z-scores were used as effect size estimates for the group effect on grey matter, FA, and MD maps, respectively, within each scanner.\nWe determined the mean and the standard deviation of Fishers Z-values across the 9 scanners and thresholded the voxels showing a significant effect at p  0.001 using the lower border of the 0.9995 confidence interval at 37:\n, with Th i  threshold for the selection of voxel i, M i  mean of Fishers Zvalues across scanners for voxel i, t  t-value for two-tailed p  0.001 with degrees of freedom  n -1, S i  standard deviation of Fishers Z-values across scanners for voxel i, and n  number of scanners.\nThe reason for using p  0.001 as primary threshold was to keep the resulting spatial pattern comparable to the results of the voxel-based meta-analysis where we have no framework for multiple comparison correction besides a bootstrapping approach which, however, would not be identical to the SPM-based FDR correction.",

Using second level analysis and voxel-based meta-analysis, the effects became spatially much more restricted with the majority of the effects being contained within the effects of the pooled analysis, with common effects across all three approaches in the corpus callosum, parahippocampal and hippocampal white matter, temporal lobe and prefrontal lobe white matter (Fig. 1).\nSimilarly, pooled analysis with scanner covariate showed wide-spread effects of increased MD in almost the entire temporal lobe white matter, including medial temporal lobe areas, as well as in corpus callosum, cingulate white matter, prefrontal lobe white matter (Table 4, Fig. 2).

      "text": "The largest spatial group effects of brain differences across modalities were observed when using the pooled analysis approach. This may be due to the fact that in the pooled analysis, a higher number of degrees of freedom results when compared to the second level and meta-analytical analyses to test group differences. The effects of the second level analysis and meta-analysis were spatially more restricted and to a large extent contained within the effects of the pooled analysis. Both the second level and meta-analysis yielded largely overlapping statistical maps of group differences for all indices tested. Therefore, both approaches seem of very similar value for determining spatial effects of white matter degeneration and grey matter atrophy in AD.\nAll three analysis approaches detected decreased FA and increased MD along the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles. This effect could potentially reflect partial volume effects with systematically larger CSF spaces in patients relative to controls. However, no group differences in FA or MD were observed at the rim of the anterior horn and the central part of the lateral ventricles, where partial volume effects are also expected. Thus, partial volume effects may not be the sole source of group differences along the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The high dimensional normalisation based on the DARTEL approach that is tuned to attenuate potential atrophy effects 53 used in our study yields a better matching of brain morphology compared to earlier studies using low dimensional normalisation for voxel based analysis 18. When we used a very conservative approach by masking the areas of decreased FA and increased MD with the areas of significant expansion of CSF spaces in AD versus controls, the main areas of FA decline and MD increase remained unchanged.\nOne important criterion to assess the advantage of one analysis method or marker over another is the diagnostic accuracy it yields in a well defined clinical sample. Using block-wise cross-validated regression with bootstrapped percentile confidence intervals, diagnostic accuracy was essentially identical between the three analysis approaches (pooled versus higher level) within each modality. Diagnostic accuracies for the grey matter volume ROIs were numerically higher than that for FA and MD. When applying the regional Fig. 3. Grey matter atrophy in AD compared to controls.

The z-transformation normalizes the signal intensity within each scanner to standard mean and variance thus reducing between scanner differences. The relatively strong effect of z-transformation on MD accuracy suggests that MD is more affected by scanner effects than FA and grey matter. This agrees with the finding of a larger variance component for scanner for the MD than the FA and grey matter measures.\nThe diagnostic accuracy for grey matter ROI was close to that reported from monocenter studies 6,54, however, the accuracy for FA and MD was inferior to that reported in monocenter studies 24,25. This observation agrees with the data from our and other prospective reliability studies, suggesting that multicenter effects are at least 50 more pronounced with FA than with measures of grey matter volume 29303155. Future studies will have to show whether this disadvantage is set off by a higher accuracy of FA and MD for the detection of AD in predementia stages such as MCI that has been found in a monocenter setting 23. The lack of differences in the diagnostic accuracy of ROIs generated by the different statistical approaches suggests that a simple pooled analysis is as effective as any other higher level statistical analysis approach applied to multicenter data to detect reliable brain differences between AD dementia and controls. It should be kept in mind though that the number of scanners was relatively small, and with higher sample size of scanners statistical approaches testing group effects at the scanner level may prove statistically more powerful. In the current retrospective study, we attempted to adjust for multicenter variability post-hoc in the statistical analysis. Part of the multicenter variability may stem from the use of different acquisition parameters and different field strengths at the different scanners. Indeed, 3 Tesla scanners showed higher values for FA, MD, and grey matter volume, independently of diagnosis, age, or gender. Although B-values, which have been shown to directly affect measures of diffusivity 56, were almost identical across scanners, our multicenter data represent a wide range of scan parameters including 6 to 61 gradient directions and 2 to 6 mm slice thickness, and different repetition times (TR) and TE values. Thus, part of the multicenter variability in the current study may be attributable to differences in scanning protocols. Indeed, adding TE to the variance component model modestly reduced the variance component attributable to scanner, where the variance component of the main effect of TE class was only 50 of the variance component of scanner. These findings indicate that TE accounted for a modest proportion of between scanner variability.\nIn a previous multicenter clinical and physical phantom study, using identical vendor and acquisition parameters, including field strength, number of gradient directions, and TE and TR modestly reduced the variation across sites compared to a wide array of vendors and parameters 57. For the brain scans, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 12.3, for a subset of scans with identical parameters on identical machines compared to a mean of 14.4 when the variability was determined across all available scans irrespective of scanner make-up or differences in sequence parameters. For the physical phantom data, the mean CV was 5.2 for a subset of scans with identical sequence parameters compared to 6.1 when parameters varied across sites and different scanner were involved 57. These data 55 in accordance with a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of FA values by different acquisition schemes 58 suggested that within the limits that are met by a clinical protocol, the differences in DTI contrasts due to different numbers of diffusion gradients and acquisition parameters are small relative to the variability of FA measures between sessions. These findings support the statement of a recent consensus group on the use of multimodal DTI in prospective studies of neurodegenerative disease within large international consortia that such studies will need to agree on minimal standards of data acquisition across different platforms, but will not be able to define a single set of parameters, scanner type, and vendor, unless a large number of centers would be excluded from such an approach 59. In summary, using a large multicenter data set, we found a typical pattern of microstructural changes of cerebral white matter in AD confirming and extending evidence from previous monocenter studies, which typically involved only 30 subjects per group or less. Using both pooled analysis and higher level modeling to consider scanner effects, we found superior accuracy of grey matter volume compared to FA and MD changes for the discrimination between AD patients and controls. Within each modality, the use of explicit models for the scanner effect incorporated in second level analysis and voxel-based meta-analysis yielded no relevant increase of diagnostic accuracy and only a slight reduction of the variance component attributable to scanner compared to the simple linear model. Our data agree with previous evidence from clinical and physical phantom studies that DTI measures are more prone to center effects than anatomical MRI scans 29303155. Presently, we are developing multivariate machine learning approaches to attenuate the effect of multicenter acquisition on group separation based on DTI data. In addition, future multicenter studies are required to determine a potential predictive value of DTI compared to anatomical MRI in clinical at risk stages of AD dementia, such as MCI.",

      "text": "In the present study, we investigated the pattern of white matter microstructural alterations and grey matter atrophy in AD patients compared to controls based on a large multicenter data set from 9 different scanners. We compared different analysis approaches to control for the effect of scanner on both spatial pattern of group differences in grey and white matter and the accuracy of the structural brain differences for group discrimination. To our knowledge, this is the first large scale multicenter study in AD comparing the classification accuracy of DTI and volumetric MRI. A simple pooled data analysis revealed a widespread pattern of subcortical white matter microstructural decline and cortical grey matter atrophy in AD patients compared to controls. A second level analysis and a voxel-based meta-analysis revealed similar patterns that were, however, spatially much more restricted. For all modalities and indices tested, the pooled analysis Fig. 2. MD increase in AD compared to controls. The effects are projected on the axial sections of a T1-weighted template brain in MNI space (IXI template).

These areas agree with previous monocenter studies using ROI or voxelbased analysis, including tract based spatial statistics 18,20,40414243. Similarly, increase of MD in cingulate gyrus, precuneus, parahippocampal gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral temporal lobe, and prefrontal lobe white matter agrees with findings of previous monocenter studies using fiber tracking and voxel-based analysis 444546. Thus, our large multicenter study confirms previous evidence on a specific impairment of intracortical projecting fiber tracts in AD from smaller monocenter studies. However, the results on the spatial distribution of group differences should be interpreted with caution, since we used a liberal alpha-threshold that may have yielded false-positives. We used the fixed threshold of alpha  0.001 since it was readily applicable to threshold the statistical maps for all statistical approaches and therefore yielded the results on the group differences comparable between different statistical approaches.\nThe neurobiological substrate of diffusion changes in AD is still unresolved. Alterations of anisotropy have been suggested to correlate primarily with the integrity of the axonal membrane based on studies on the squid axon and a myelin knock-out mouse model 47. Intra-axonal structures are believed to determine the diffusion parallel to the axonal fibers (axial diffusion), whereas changes in the myelin sheaths and axonal membranes underlie diffusion perpendicular to the axonal fibers (radial diffusion) 48,49. Future multimodal imaging studies, combining DTI with complementary information on white matter biochemical alterations using MR spectroscopy 50 may help in future to better understand the neurobiological substrate of white matter alterations in AD 51,52.

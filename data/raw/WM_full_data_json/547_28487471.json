    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been proposed as clinical trial markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) due to their associations with outcomes such as cognition. However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age 68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n  lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized β 0.268), mental flexibility (β 0.306), verbal fluency (β 0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (β 0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes a quarter of all ischaemic strokes, is the most common pathology underlying vascular cognitive impairment and dementia 1 and contributes to the severity of Alzheimers disease 2. SVD affects the small vessels of the brain and results in a number of characteristic radiological appearances best seen on MRI, including lacunar infarcts, T2-white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy 3,4. In terms of symptoms, cognitive impairment may be the most debilitating 5, with SVD characteristically associated with early deficits in executive function and processing speed, while episodic memory is relatively spared 1,2,6789.\nDespite the public health importance of SVD, there are few specific treatments 10. Furthermore, evaluating treatments represent a major challenge due to the variable rate of cognitive decline, which can be slow in many patients, but occurs rapidly with progression to dementia in a subset. While cognitive testing plays a central role in identifying the presence of cognitive impairment, it has proved to be relatively insensitive to longitudinal change 11. This has led to the suggestion that MRI might represent a useful surrogate marker to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in smaller number of patients prior to larger phase III trials 3,12.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to be particularly sensitive to white matter damage in SVD. Abnormalities have been shown not only within T2-WMH but also in apparently normal appearing white matter 13, and these changes correlate better with cognition than WMH lesion volume 8. In single-centre studies, change in DTI could be detected in SVD patients over follow-up periods of 1-3 years 14,15. This has led to the suggestion that DTI might provide a useful surrogate marker and power calculations for phase II trials based on the rate of DTI change seen in these papers, which show that its use may allow evaluation of therapeutic interventions with much smaller sample sizes than if cognitive function was used as an outcome measure 11. However, studies conducted to date have been single-centre 12,15,16. Most therapeutic trials are likely to be multicentre and involve acquisition of DTI across different sites. As image acquisition will be on different scanners, this may present challenges 17. It is important to assess whether DTI is feasible in a clinical trial setting, and whether similar associations between MRI parameters and clinical and cognitive variables can be detected in the multicentre setting. One way of assessing this is to determine whether the strength of association between DTI and cognition in multicentre studies is similar to that previously reported in single-centre studies.\nTo evaluate this, we determined the association between DTI parameters and cognition in the baseline data of a multicentre trial.",

A cognitive test battery was used which included tests sensitive to the characteristic impairments in processing speed and executive function associated with SVD 2, with additional testing of memory. This included for Processing speed the Digit Symbol Coding test (DSC) 19, and for executive functioning the Trail Making Test (TMT, 20) to measure mental flexibility and a phonemic verbal fluency task (FAS) 21 and a semantic verbal fluency task (animals) 22 to measure verbal generativity.Memory was measured using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, 23). Premorbid IQ was estimated using the restandardized National Adult Reading Test (NART-R, 24) and additional screening for cognitive impairment was conducted using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, 25).\nIn addition, following assessments of disability and quality of life (QoL) were performed; the stroke-specific QoL assessment (SSQoL) 26 and the EuroQoL 27.\nPerformance across neuropsychological tests was made comparable by transforming raw scores into z-scores using the best available age-scaled normative data (DSC; 19, TMT; 28, letter fluency; 21, animal fluency; 22, RAVLT; 28). Tasks were grouped into four key domains (Processing speed: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale coding total correct, TMT-A time to complete, Mental flexibility: TMT-B time to complete, Verbal fluency: total correct for FAS letter fluency and animal fluency and Verbal memory: RAVLT immediate and delayed recall). Individual task z-scores were averaged across these groupings to create overall domain scores, while all domain scores were averaged to create a Global cognition domain. SSQoL (total score), EuroQoL (healthstate rating) and the MoCA (total score) were analysed individually using raw scores.\nWhere data were missing due to a subject being unable to complete a task, the lowest available z-score was given; this applied to 15 individual tasks, across 13 participants (11.9 of the sample size). If data were missing for any other reasons then the domain scores were calculated without that task; this applied to three participants (2.8 of the sample size).",

Within the six centres, eight 3-Tesla MR scanners were used (three Philips Achieva TX, one Philips Achieva, one Philips Ingenia, one Siemens Verio, one Siemens Prisma, one Siemens Magnetom Prisma fit). MRI acquisition included 3D T1-weighted (T1W), and DTI, T2-weighted (T2W) and Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) scans for each participant. A rigorous quality control was implemented to ensure sequence acquisition parameters were as standardized as possible. T1W scans were acquired at 1-mm 3 isotropic voxel resolution and TR and TE were optimized to ensure comparable T1 weighting and tissue contrast across sites. DTI scans (2-mm 3 isotropic voxel resolution) had similar TEs and long TRs to avoid T1 relaxation effects. In addition to the b 0 s mm -2 acquisitions, all DTI acquisition included 32 equally spaced, non-collinear diffusion gradient directions (b 1000 s mm -2 ) to ensure identical angular resolution and noise characteristics. T2W sequences were TE matched and kept a similar TR to ensure comparable weighting. FLAIR sequences had identical inversion times and were also TE matched with long enough TRs to ensure no T1 weighting occurred. Resolution for T2W and FLAIR sequences varied between sites; Supplementary Table S1 gives an overview of the exact scanner and sequence details per site.",

Whole brain WMH lesions maps were generated and a WMH lesion load score was calculated as the percentage of WMH lesion volume against whole brain volume. To assess intra-and inter-rater reliability, a test set of ten FLAIR scans (from a previous study in SVD) with varying degrees of WMH was used. In a randomized, blinded setting FLAIR images were each marked twice by I.D.C. and once by a second experienced rater (D.T.).

The native space brain volumes were multiplied by this scaling factor to provide normalized brain volumes (NBVs).

Briefly, DTI scans were eddy current corrected with eddy correct using the first acquired b 0 s mm -2 image as the reference. A binary brain mask in DTI space was calculated for each subject using BET on the same b 0 acquisition. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were then calculated from these data using DTIFIT. Voxels with MD values above 0.0026 mm 2 s -1 were removed from analyses in case they had been misclassified as CSF voxels by application of a diffusivity threshold. Likewise, spurious voxels with FA 1 were also removed. For each participant, FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT, 37, using the normalized mutual information cost function in FSL) was used to register the FLAIR to the T1W image and the T1W to the b0 image (the average of all the b 0 s mm -2 images in the DTI sequence). These affine transformation matrices were concatenated to create a third FLAIR-to-DTI transformation. TPMs and WMH lesion masks were registered into DTI space using the T1W-to-DTI (trilinear interpolation) and FLAIR-to-DTI (nearest neighbour interpolation) transforms for TPMs and binary WMH lesion masks respectively.\nA hard segmentation method was applied to generate maps of tissue classes. This was achieved by voxelwise comparison of the GM, WM and CSF TPMs, with each voxel being assigned to the highest probability tissue class. The WMH lesion masks were then added with these lesion voxels being automatically assigned to WMH. Finally, mask images of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and all white matter (WM) were generated from the hard segmentation map.\nHistogram analysis was performed on FA and MD maps in both NAWM and WM. Normalized histograms with 1000 bins (FA range: 0-1, bin width: 0.001; MD range: 0-4 mm 2 s -1  10 -3 , bin width: 0.004 mm 2 s -1  10 -3 ) were computed and median, peak height and peak value were extracted from these for both FA and MD. These metrics were chosen as summary measures as FA and MD are non-normally distributed in WM. One measure for each MD and FA was chosen for the main study analyses. MD (normalized) peak height and FA median were picked due to previous studies which have shown these to be correlated with cognition 8,14 and sensitive to change in WM microstructure in SVD 11,15.",

This pipeline was structured as a method of selecting the most appropriate MRI measure per type (e.g. one brain tissue volume measurement or MDFA histogram parameter for DTI) so that contributions of MRI metrics could be assessed together, while avoiding issues of multicollinearity. Thus, in Simple models, the association of NBV, WMH lesion load, lacunes and histogram parameters (from NAWM and WM) were separately investigated against each outcome measure (cognitive domains, QoL and MoCA). As there were multiple NBV and DTI variables, the most significant of each type (or if P-value was the same, the one with the largest β-value) per outcome measure, was selected and used in the Complex model. Here, NBV, WMH lesion load, n  lacunes and DTI measures were included together to assess their contributions relative to each other. Separate Complex models were performed for each outcome measure, in WM and NAWM. These models controlled for confounding effects of age, gender, premorbid IQ and were stratified by study site.

Comparison of all outcome measures (i.e. cognitive domains, MoCA and QoL scales) between sites by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis also showed no significant findings (P-value range: 0.192-0.827).\nComplex model analyses were also repeated at sites 1, 2 and 3 individually.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this analysis of baseline data from a multicentre clinical trial of SVD, we found associations between DTI metrics and cognition of a similar magnitude to those reported in previous single-centre studies. This provides support for the use of DTI measures as surrogate markers in clinical trials of SVD.\nWe found that both DTI markers and lacunar infarct count were independently associated with Global cognition and MoCA results. Additionally, DTI markers were independently associated with Mental flexibility and Verbal fluency, and lacunes with Processing speed and SSQoL. In contrast, we found no independent associations between WMH lesion load and cognition and only two for brain volume (with MoCA and EuroQoL). This is in-line with most previous literature from single-centre studies, which have found weak or absent associations between WMH and cognition in patients with severe symptomatic SVD 8,29,39. However, it has been previously shown, as we also have, that the presence and number of lacunar infarcts 8,38 and the extent of diffuse WM damage assessed on DTI 8,12,29,31,38,39, are the strongest predictors of cognitive functioning. Furthermore, both have been shown to predict risk of dementia in longitudinal studies 41,42, while lacunes and the apparent diffusion coefficient (a diffusion-weighted imaging measure highly similar to MD) have also been shown to predict future cognitive decline 43,44. Number of lacunes was chosen in the present study instead of lacune volume as it is a more practical measure to obtain in a clinical setting, and similar associations with cognitive performance have been found between these in a comparable severe SVD population 45.\nClinical trials of new agents in SVD will need to be multicentre and if MRI is to be used as a surrogate marker, it is important to evaluate how the different markers perform in a multicentre setting. While research in other neurological disorders such as Parkinsons 46 and Huntingtons 47 disease have shown that DTI markers of disease can be successfully applied in a mutlicentre study, there have been few studies addressing this issue in SVD. The use of multiple scanners, possibly from different manufacturers, is likely to add noise and may diminish the statistical sensitivity of these metrics.\nPRESERVE is one of the first studies to use advanced MRI as a surrogate marker in SVD trials. In this setting, we have shown that the magnitudes of associations between DTI and cognition are highly comparable with previous, single-centre studies, further validating the use of these metrics in this context. Additionally, while WM and NAWM DTI were always significantly associated with the same outcomes, the strengths of these associations was consistently descriptively greater in WM models. This indicates the simpler process of obtaining a WM mask is at least equally valid and may be more practical in a clinical setting. It should also be noted that previous research has indicated through power calculations that DTI parameters could detect change with much smaller sample sizes than lacunes, due to the frequency of new lacunes being relatively low 11. This suggests that DTI metrics may be the most powerful surrogate marker of the two.\nExamination of individual site data did demonstrate some variation in the strength of associations between MR parameters and cognition from different centres, but the majority of these effect sizes were within (or greater than) the expected ranges as determined by 95 CIs for β-values and regression slopes from the main analyses. DTI metrics and cognition did not significantly differ between sites, meaning that it is likely that a lack of power due to a low site sample size was a contributing factor to the instances where this was not the case. The similarity of DTI and cognitive metrics across sites also suggests good comparability between the centres involved in the present study. With respect to the wider literature however, the authors do note that DTI metrics have sometimes been shown to differ in magnitude between manufacturers, such as one paper where MD values were found to be systematically higher on Siemens compared with Philips scanners (this would not affect peak height of MD as used in the presented study, but could affect measures of MD centrality 48). Another paper 49 examined reproducibility of whole brain MD peak height between a 1.5T and a 3T Siemens scanner in a sample size of seven CADASIL patients, which achieved an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.752 (indicating good reliability 50). A further paper has found that scanner upgrades to affect DTI after scanning CADASIL patients 51. These findings show that caution should be used when combining DTI data from different manufacturers or when taking measurements over time and future research may wish to take this into account in analyses. These considerations also highlight the importance of conducting multicentre scanner calibration and standardization of acquisition protocols prior to study commencement, as well as on-going quality control checks during the study duration in multicentre research of this nature.\nThere were some limitations to the present study. There were variable sample sizes across sites, meaning the influence of some centres is much stronger than others on our findings. In particular, having a greater number of participants scanned on non-Philips hardware would have provided more information about the comparability across scanners. The lack of data on inter-scanner reproducibility is also limiting and would have been valuable in more closely judging the sensitivity of these metrics across sites. It would also have been advantageous to acquire a field map with the DTI protocol so that corrections for susceptibility induced distortions could have been made. However registration to DTI space did appear good, so this is unlikely to have caused any major problems.\nTo conclude, in a multicentre study, we have shown that DTI metrics and lacune count correlate with cognition to a similar degree to that found in single-centre studies. Our findings support the use of DTI as a surrogate marker of SVD in multicentre studies.",

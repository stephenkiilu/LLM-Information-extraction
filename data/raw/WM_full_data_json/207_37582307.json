    "abstract": "Changes in the brain of patients with Huntingtons disease (HD) begin years before clinical onset, so it remains critical to identify biomarkers to track these early changes. Metrics derived from tensor modeling of diffusionweighted MRIs (DTI), that indicate the microscopic brain structure, can add important information to regional volumetric measurements. This study uses two large-scale longitudinal, multicenter datasets, PREDICT-HD and IMAGE-HD, to trace changes in DTI of HD participants with a broad range of CAP scores (a product of CAG repeat expansion and age), including those with pre-manifest disease (i.e., prior to clinical onset). Utilizing a fully automated data-driven approach to study the whole brain divided in regions of interest, we traced changes in DTI metrics (diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) versus CAP scores, using sigmoidal and linear regression models. We identified points of inflection in the sigmoidal regression using change-point analysis. The deep gray matter showed more evident and earlier changes in DTI metrics over CAP scores, compared to the deep white matter. In the deep white matter, these changes were more evident and occurred earlier in superior and posterior areas, compared to anterior and inferior areas. The curves of mean diffusivity vs. age of HD participants within a fixed CAP score were different from those of controls, indicating that the disease has an additional effect to age on the microscopic brain structure. These results show the regional and temporal vulnerability of the white matter and deep gray matter in HD, with potential implications for experimental therapeutics.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a degenerative disease that classically manifests with motor, cognitive and behavioral features (Ross, 2014;Tabrizi et al., 2020). The diagnosis is based on the assessment of motor signs using the unified Huntingtons disease rating scale (UHDRS) (Kremer et al., 1996) and cognitive deficits (Ross et al., 2019). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT) on chromosome 4, which codes for polyglutamine in the Huntingtin protein (Htt). Longer CAG repeat length has been associated to early HD onset (Brinkman et al., 1997). The so called CAP score, a product of the CAG repeat length and the individuals age (Ross, 2014;Zhang, 2011) is accepted as an index of the extent of exposure to the CAG expansion mutation.\nWhile HD has traditionally been noted for selective striatal neurodegeneration (Vonsattel, 1985); there are increasing evidences that many other regions of the brain are affected (Rüb, 2016) in different stages of the disease, and in multiple ways other than atrophy. Early single-site and more recent multicenter studies (Aylward et al., 2013;Paulsen, 2014;Tabrizi, 2013;Dominguez, 2016) showed progressive striatal atrophy many years prior to the onset of motor symptoms, associated with subcortical white matter atrophy (Novak et al., 2014;Paulsen, 2006;Stoffers et al., 2010). Previous diffusion tensor image (DTI) studies indicated white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum (Crawford et al., 2013), internal capsule (Rosas, 2006), corticospinal tract (Phillips et al., 2015); cortico-striatal circuit (Novak et al., 2014), and extensively distributed in the white matter (Novak et al., 2014;Reading et al., 2005;Faria et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2018) years before symptoms occur. Reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and increase in mean diffusivity (MD), which may be related to the disruption of white matter integrity and the increase of tissue water content (Winklewski et al., 2018;Orth et al., 2016), were consistently reported.\nAlthough the previous studies have been insightful, they used different analytic methods, and have emphasized different hypothesis and results. Furthermore, several studies focused in specific regions of interest, and did not use large multi-center datasets (Georgiou-Karistianis, 2013;Tan, et al., 2022) (see (Gatto and Weissmann, 2019;van de Zande et al., 2022) for reviews). With the advances in automated imaging processing and analysis, and the accumulation and sharing of data from multicenter studies, we are now able to analyze large datasets together (Müller et al., 2011;Müller, 2013); across a range of CAP scores, using a fully automated and data driven approach (Steventon et al., 2016). We traced the longitudinal evolution of DTI indices, as a reflection of the white matter tissue status through PREDICT-HD and IMAGE-HD datasets. We found dramatic changes correlating with CAP scores, particularly in mean diffusivity, involving, but not restricted to, the basal ganglia circuit. We used change-point analysis to assess the inflection points in which the changes accelerate. We then evaluated the influence of the disease, versus sole age effect, in the evolution of DTI metrics.",

    "Datasets": {
      "text": "The datasets were obtained from two multicenter longitudinal studies, PREDICT-HD (Paulsen, 2006) and IMAGE-HD (Poudel, 2015), through CHDI (https:chdifoundation.org). From PREDICT-HD, 463 HD participants with premanifest disease at study entry (i.e., before symptoms onset) and 159 healthy controls were included. From IMAGE-HD, 72 HD participants (both premanifest and manifest HD participants at entry) and 35 controls were included. The demographic characteristics of participants included in this study (after quality control exclusions, described in the Supplementary Table 1) are shown in Table 1.\nSince the datasets have proportionally less very far-from-onset HD participants, we instead used controls as surrogates for them. This is supported by studies showing gene carriers very far from onset (about 20 years) have image metrics essentially equivalent to normal (Scahill, 2020); and the first differences in fiber density are reported about 10 years before onset (Zeun, et al., 2021). We note that, if HD is a neurodevelopmental disease (van der Plas et al., 2019;van der Plas et al., 2020;Meng et al., 2017;Pérot, 2022), the controls data should be interpreted as reflecting a combination of developmental differences, plus the major component of degeneration. To help spreading the controls data out over a larger range of CAP scores (Liu, 2022), CAG repeats  39.2 were used for controls, in the formula CAP  Age(CAG-33.66) (Zhang, 2011). Although this is arbitrary, it is based on the fact that, while the HD phenotype is not always penetrant in individuals with 36 to 39 repeats (Kremer, 1994;Rubinsztein, 1996), higher disease repeats are virtually always associated to individuals who will develop HD pathology (Maat-Kievit et al., 2001;Langbehn, 2004), which the controls are surrogates for.",

    "Image processing": {
      "text": "The 3T MRIs were automatically segmented and postprocessed through MRICloud (https:www.MRICloud.org) (Mori, 2016), a public web-based service for multi-contrast imaging segmentation and quantification. The DTI tensor reconstruction and quality control followed the algorithm used by DtiStudio (https:www.MRIStudio.org). The DTI segmentation involved image mapping based on a sequence of linear algorithms and Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Mapping (LDDMM) (Ceritoglu et al., 2013), using complementary contrasts (mean diffusivity MD, fractional anisotropy FA, and the eigenvector that indicates fiber orientation), and a final step of multi-atlas labeling fusion (Tang et al., 2013;Tang et al., 2014).\nThe original images along with the results of the brain segmentation obtained from MRICloud were visually inspected for quality control. The image quality control leaded to the exclusion of 42 PREDICT-HD scans (14 from control group and 28 from HD group, specifically 16 high-CAP, 8 medium-CAP, 4 low-CAP, according to the criteria in (Zhang, 2011), and 2 IMAGE-HD scans (1 control, 1 HD). This corresponds to approximately 2.8 of our datasets. The reasons for exclusion were: incomplete brain coverage andor errors in the initial linear image registration (21 scans),ghost effect and other technical corruption artifacts (19 scans), motion artifacts (4 scans: 3 controls and 1 HD high-CAP). We additionally excluded 7 PREDICT scans with unconfirmed CAP scores. Please note that Table 1 shows only the data used in this study, therefore after the quality control exclusions. Human correction of the segmentation was avoided, as the aim is to report the results of a consistent automated process across all the images.",

    "Regions and metrics analyzed": {
      "text": "The deep gray matter and whole brain white matter were automatically segmented, in regions of interest (ROIs) defined in digital white (Zhang, 2011).\nB. Hu et al.\nmatter atlases (Oishi et al., 2009;Mori et al., 2009). These ROIs were putamen, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, anterior, posterior and superior corona radiata, anterior and posterior limb internal capsule, corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, middle cere-bellar peduncle, posterior thalamic radiation, retrolenticular internal capsule, sagittal stratum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. The superficial white matter considered were areas with FA  0.25 beneath the following gyri: superior, middle and inferior frontal, temporal and occipital, superior parietal, post-central, pre-central, angular, supramarginal, fusiform, cuneus, pre-cuneus, lingual, lateral and middle fronto-orbital, rectus, insula and cingulate. We also analyzed the cerebellar white matter. ROIs in both hemispheres were considered together as there is is little evidence for significant asymmetry in HD (Rosas et al., 2002;Klöppel et al., 2008). Brainstem was not included because the variable level of scan coverage could introduce artifact variations (Vaswani, 2017).\nAt each voxel, the DTI defines a diffusion tensor composed of three orthogonal eigenvectors and respective eigenvalues (λ 1 , λ 2 and λ 3 , in descending order of amplitude). The following metrics were analyzed in this study: 1) Axial Diffusivity (AD, or λ 1 ), which describes the rate of diffusion along the orientation of the fibers; 2) Radial Diffusivity (RD, the mean of λ 2 and λ 3 ), which is proportional to the diffusion magnitude in the plane perpendicular to the axon bundles. 3) Trace (the sum of λ 1 , λ 2 and λ 3 ) which is proportional to the mean diffusivity, MD (which is trace  3); and 4) Fractional Anisotropy (FA, similar to the standard deviation of λ 1 , λ 2 and λ 3 , ranging from 0 to 1), which is proportional to the diffusion asymmetry within a voxel. Based on seminal studies (Beaulieu and Allen, 1994;Beaulieu and Allen, 1994;Moseley et al., 1991;Gulani et al., 2001;Takahashi, 2002;Kinoshita et al., 1999), AD has been accepted as indicator of axional damage; RD is correlated with myelin damage; MD possibly reflects structural integrity as well as FA, which is also an indicator of fiber density, axonal organization and myelination. Although our study cannot define the cellular bases of these metrics, it can help map the topography of possible abnormalities.",

    "Statistical models": {
      "text": "Two models, a linear fitting and a left-flat sigmoidal function (as defined in (Liu, 2022), were implemented to capture the changes in DTI metrics in each ROI over CAP scores. We chose the sigmoidal model based on previous work characterizing age differences and longitudinal changes of diffusion MRI metrics (Beck et al., 2021;Benitez et al., 2018;Falangola, 2008;Jelescu, 2015;Kodiweera et al., 2016;Westlye et al., 2010;Faria et al., 2010), and our previous analysis of volumetric changes in HD (Liu, 2022). Through these studies, we expected curvilinear relationships with age and CAPs, with varying trajectories and deflection points possibly reflecting differential involvement and rate of change of the putative biological underpinnings during the different phases of the disease. We statistically tested the sigmoidal models against linear models to find whether, and for which structure, they provide a better reflection of the progressive, but expected non-linear, nature of neurodegeneration in HD.\nThese are hybrid models that consider a combination of withinsubject and between-subject effects. The models assumed that far from the disease onset (low CAP) HD brains are indistinguishable from healthy controls brains. The source of data (PREDICT-HD or IMAGE-HD) and the subject group (control or HD) were models covariates. For the ROIs in which the sigmoidal model was significantly different from the linear model (p-value  0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), a change-point was inferred from the sigmoidal regression models, similar to (Wu et al., 2017). The change-point indirectly indicates the point (CAP score) in which changes in brain anatomy (DTI indices) become greater (i.e., where the fitting curve pass through the flat part to the steep part). The variance of the change-point was assessed via parametric bootstrap with 1000 folds. The construction of the statistical regression models was carried out using Python 3.7.\nAn additional important question is whether the changes of DTI indices over time reflect only natural aging (Beck et al., 2021;Benitez et al., 2018;Falangola, 2008;Jelescu, 2015;Kodiweera et al., 2016;Westlye et al., 2010), or if there are additional effects of the disease. To answer this question, we compared 173 HD participants in a tight range of CAG repeats with a group of 159 controls paired in age and sex (Table 2). Differences between the curves of DWI indices in each ROI versus age were accessed with Chow test (Chow, 1960), corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).",

    "Results": {
      "text": "For most of brain areas and DTI metrics, the left-flat sigmoidal fitting did not differ significantly from the linear fitting. Therefore, for most of brain areas, the results of the simplest model (linear) are shown. Exceptions were trace, AD, and RD in the deep gray and deep white matter (Fig. 1; the individual spaghetti plots that generated those curves, per metric and per ROI, are in Supplementary Material). In these areas, the evolution of the DTI indices (except FA) over CAP scores followed sigmoidal curves better than linear ones, with DTI indices showing a plateau at low CAP scores, then drastically increasing. Table 3 shows the change-points estimated with the sigmoidal curves. These change-points are graphically represented in Fig. 3. In general, for each ROI, the change-points occurred within a similar time frame for trace, MD and AD. The change-point was earlier (i.e., at lower CAP scores) in the deep gray matter (putamen and globus pallidus) than in the deep white matter (superior corona radiata and sagittal stratum).\nTable 4 shows the linear models slopes and r-squared in the ROIs and metrics for which the sigmoidal fitting did not differ from the linear fitting (so we favoured to present the results of the simplest model) (see Fig. 4 for graphic illustration). The complete description of the linear parameters, for all the regions and metrics, is shown in the supplementary materials. Similar to the change-points, we observed a general tendency of more conspicuous changes (highest slopes and r-squared) in the deep gray matter, followed by corpus callosum and thalamus, then deep white matter, and peripheral white matter at last. Within the white matter, posterior and superior structures (e.g., posterior thalamic radiations and superior corona radiata within the deep white matter, and occipital and parietal areas within the peripheral white matter) tended to have more conspicuous changes in trace, RD, and MD. The FA had an inverse relationship with CAP scores (as expected) and was the least sensitive index, with the largest number of ROIs showing no significant change of FA over CAP scores.\nThe curves of DTI indices vs. age of HD participants (CAG 41-42) were significantly different from those of controls in the majority of the deep gray and white matter ROIs as shown in Table 4 and illustrative spaghetti plots in Fig. 2 (other spaghetti plots are in the supplementary material). This indirectly indicates that the disease plays a role in the evolution of DTI indices, in addition to the natural aging. The trace, RD and AD curves were even less similar between HD and controls, compared to the FA curves. This again provides evidences that FA may be less sensitive than the other DTI indices to the HD time course.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We traced the longitudinal evolution of DTI metrics in HD aiming to describe a regional or temporal vulnerability pattern of potential relevance for future therapeutic design. In agreement with previous studies (see (Estevez-Fraga et al., 2021) for a review) our results showed longitudinal changes in DTI indices in most regions of the brain. Although this is expected according to the natural aging process (Westlye et al., 2010;Salat, 2005;Lebel et al., 2012;Behler et al., 2021;Bethlehem, 2022), the comparison of curves of HD participants, in a restricted range of CAG repeat with age-paired controls, indicated widespread differences, therefore highlighting an additional significant disease effect. As in other neurodegenerative diseases, there were longitudinal increases in diffusivity metrics (i.e., trace, RD, AD) and a decrease in FA (Gatto and Weissmann, 2019;van de Zande et al., 2022) (except in predominantly gray matter structures, in which FA longitudinally increases (Pfefferbaum et al., 2010); potentially reflecting loss of neurons andor connections and therefore a simplification of the fiber composition (Estevez-Fraga et al., 2021). The trace was more sensitive than FA (which is more affected by the image noise (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996;Magnotta et al., 2012), indicating that HD is likely to cause disturbances of the microstructural organization that are more Note:  indicates no significant difference between sigmoidal and linear models fitting the specific DTI index over CAP scores in the region in question. The results are still presented in this table for the sake of consistency. sensitively detected by MD than by FA measurements.\nThe deep gray matter and the deep white matter areas, such as superior corona radiata and sagittal stratum, tended to be affected in earlier stages (i.e., at lower CAP scores), compared to peripheral areas, such as the white matter beneath the lingual and middle occipital gyri. This is possibly due to a combination of biological and technical effects. Technically, the peripheral white matter areas are more susceptible to image noise and mapping inaccuracies (Snook et al., 2007). Note, for instance, the higher variability of all four DTI metrics in the peripheral compared to core white matter in the Supplementary Material spaghetti plots. Biologically, it is reasonable to ascertain that changes in deep areas occur first and more dramatically than in peripheral areas. This agrees with the sequence of atrophy observed in brain structures, showed by multicenter longitudinal studies (Liu, 2022) and simulations, (Wijeratne et al., 2021) that atrophy in basal ganglia circuit including caudate, putamen, globus pallidus is more dramatic compared with other regions (i.e., superior frontal and superior temporal white matter) which are generally steady and slower.\nThis gradient of changes also agrees with our previous observations in a smaller dataset (Faria et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2017), that the evolution of diffusivity indices seem to follow a centripetal and posterioranterior temporal gradient, in which mesial and posterior white matter areas show changes in DTI indices earlier than inferior and anterior areas. For instance, superior corona radiata and sagittal stratum presented earlier change points than anterior limb of internal capsule and uncinate fasciculus. This observation also indirectly aligns with the theory of spread of pathology from the basal ganglia circuit to other parts of the brain (Ross, 2014).\nThe strengths of this study include the analysis of two large and multicenter datasets, with a total of 729 participants in multiple time points. The combination of different datasets and inclusion of heterogeneous data enhances the potential generalization of the results. We adopted the same automated, data-driven approach to automatically process a large number of DTIs, increasing the robustness of our findings and enabling further reproducibility studies. In addition, the population has a wide range of CAP scores, with most participants in premanifest period, a relatively early stage of HD.\nThere are, however, several limitations. There are possible inaccuracies on brain segmentation, particularly in regions with low contrast, that are more liable to higher variation on the boundary definition. We did not make manual corrections on individual basis, first because the variability on brain segmentation is an issue faced by humans as well, and second because we wanted to keep the methodology completely automated, reproducible, and feasible to other Big Data studies. Therefore, the results must be interpreted in the light of the regional segmentation reliability (Rezende, 2019). The DWI protocols were homogenized as much as possible among the different centers that participated of PREDICT and Image-HD. However, it is impossible to eliminate all the residual differences in data from different centers and scanners. Although we included the study source as a covariant of our models, the lack of effective harmonization for all the possible image parameters may increase the data variance and the risk of false negative results. Moreover, the current study benefits from a mixed crosssectional and longitudinal design, where participants can be used as their own baseline (Sexton, 2014). However, the main results were largely driven by the cross-sectional data, whose samples dominate the longitudinal one. Finally, we artificially used controls as surrogates for very far-from-onset HD subjects. This has to be taken with caution, particularly considering the hypothesis of HD as a neurodevelopmental disease, which would make the groups not comparable. Regardless of all these limitations, these data provide a comprehensive description of the natural history of regional microscopic brain structures in HD. They highlight the widespread degeneration of many regions of the brain including white matter, which is consistent with studies showing that not just neurons but other cells can contribute to HD pathogenesis (Creus-Muncunill and Ehrlich, 2019). They also highlight the predominant influence on regions in the basal ganglia circuit with implications for pathogenesis (Poudel et al., 2019;Rüb et al., 2014;Waldvogel et al., 2015) and experimental therapeutics. For example, these results support the hypothesis of circuit-based spread of pathology in HD, possibly due to the spread of mutant Htt protein (Cicchetti et al., 2014;Gosset et al., 2020;Lee, 2020;Pecho-Vrieseling, 2014;Masnata et al., 2019) or other mechanisms such as loss of growth factor transport, or altered synaptic connectivity (Virlogeux et al., 2018;Saudou and Humbert, 2016), perhaps due to abnormal complementmediated pruning (Liddelow et al., 2017). They indirectly imply the search for novel therapeutic targets related to prion-like spread of pathology, and for modifications in therapeutic approaches solely focused on the caudate and putamen, which misses other early affected brain structures.\nIn conclusion, this study spans key stages of HD and represents the most comprehensive delineation of the natural history of regional brain changes in DTI metrics to date. It provides a detailed overview of how DTI metrics change over the progression of HD, shedding light to potential markers for understanding the natural history of HD, and for designing of experimental therapeutics. Note:  indicates no significant difference between curves of controls and HD after correction for multiple comparisons. B. Hu et al.",

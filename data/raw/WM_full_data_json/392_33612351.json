    "abstract": "Comparative evaluation of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a whole-brain atlas to comprehensively evaluate microstructural changes in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AzD) patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven AzD patients and 25 age-matched controls were included. MRI data was analyzed using a whole-brain atlas with inclusion of 98 region of interests. White matter (WM) microstructural changes were assessed by Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), Kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK) and radial kurtosis (RK). Gray matter (GM) integrity was evaluated using KFA, MK, RK, AK and MD. Comparison of the DKI and DTI metrics were done using student t-test (p 0.001). RESULTS: In AzD patients widespread increase in MD, AD and RD were found in various WM and GM region of interests. The extent of abnormality for DKI parameters was more limited in both GM and WM regions and revealed reduced kurtosis values except in lentiform nuclei. Both DKI and DTI parameters were sensitive to detect abnormality in WM areas with coherent and complex fiber arrangement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for hippocampal values revealed the highest specificity of 88 for AK 0.6965 and highest sensitivity of 95.2 for MD 1.2659. CONCLUSION: AzD patients have microstructural changes in both WM and GM and are well-depicted by both DKI and DTI. The alterations in kurtosis parameters, however, are more limited and correlate with areas in the brain primarily involved in cognition.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "A lzheimer disease (AzD) is an irreversible, gradually progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which accounts for approximately 50À60 of all cases of dementia and has affected more than 35 million people worldwide. The incidence of AzD is expected to multiply by 3 times by 2050, taking the overall number of cases up to approximately 115 million (1). The pathogenesis of AzD is complex and is characterized histopathologically by deposition of extracellular neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It has been proposed that these proteins represent a cellular adaptation to the oxidative stress leading to structural and functional disruptions among anatomically distinct but related brain regions (2) Developments in MRI provide an understanding of the microstructural arrangement and integrity of the brain tissue. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is the most commonly exploited tool to evaluate white matter (WM) changes in the brain. Few studies have demonstrated that in AzD patients, there is increase in mean diffusivity (MD) along with reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) values in various WM regions (3À5) DTI relies on the postulation that displacement distribution of water molecules obeys Gaussian function. However, this is not true for the biological tissues where various barriers like organelles and cell membranes render the water displacement to be non-Gaussian (6). It has been shown that kurtosis parameters obtained from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) are particularly appropriate for assessing the microstructural integrity in WM regions having complex fiber arrangement (7). An additional advantage over DTI is that it can also be implemented to assess microstructural changes in gray matter (GM) regions. DKI has been shown to improve the diagnostic capability in various developmental as well as pathological aberrations in neural tissue in contrast to conventional DTI (8À11).\nSome preliminary studies done in patients with AzD have shown differences in the kurtosis parameters between AzD patients and healthy individuals (12À17). Most of these studies are based on the manual region of interest analysis from DKI data. This needs extensive efforts and results of which may vary depending upon the size and locus of region of interest (ROI) drawn by the operator. However, this explorative study is unique in terms of application of a whole-brain atlas for a more accurate evaluation of microstructural changes in an AzD patient. Another distinctive attribute of this study is comparing DTI and DKI data in extensive areas of the brain and also determining whether DKI-derived metrics can provide a more comprehensive assessment of such alterations in AzD patients than DTI metrics.",

Besides, written informed consent was acquired from all the volunteers or if not possible, from their legal guardians for the use of this data. A total of 27 AzD patients along with 25 age-matched healthy controls were included in this study (Table 1). Neurocognitive assessment was done for all these subjects using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients were diagnosed to have probable AzD according to the DSM-V clinical criteria. Additionally, to rule out cognitive decline, all the healthy individuals underwent a Montreal Cognitive Assessment. These control subjects had no neurological or psychiatric history and evidence of any organic disease pertaining to the central nervous system. Exclusion criteria included presence of organic brain syndrome, neuropsychiatric disorder, presence of major neurological disease (eg, stroke), suboptimal acquisition due to artifacts and also patients with contraindications to MR exam such as metallic implants. One subject with severe AzD having MMSE score of 5 was excluded from the study in view of presence of excessive motion artifacts.",

      "text": "All the subjects were scanned in a 3T MRI scanner (Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-array head coil. The MRI sequences included T2 (spin-echo, TETR: 966000 ms, 25 slices, 4 mm slice thickness), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR, TETR: 949000 ms, 25 slices, 4 mm slice thickness), T1-MPRAGE (TETR:2.471970 ms, 1 mm 3 isotropic). These conventional sequences were first analyzed thoroughly to rule out other causes of dementia including vascular dementia. Subsequently, DKI was done using 3 b-values (0, 1000 and 2000 smm 2 ) along 30 diffusion encoding directions using a vendor-supplied single-shot twicerefocused SE-EPI sequence with number of excitations (NEX)  1 (NEX  10 for b  0). Other DKI parameters used were: slice thickness  3 mm, No. of slices  54, TR TE  11,50098 ms, field-of-view  222  222 mm, acquisition matrix  74  74, image resolution  3  3 mm, acquisition time  12:16 minutes.",

DTI based values were obtained from the data acquired at b value of 2000 s mm 2 . Thereafter, using the DiffeoMap software, the subject space FA and b0 images of each subject were registered to a single-subject FA and b0 images (ie, Eve template in Montreal Neurological Institute space). Next, the inverse transformation algorithms were applied to the 189-region brain atlas to obtain ROIs that are within each subjects original brain space. A total of 98 ROIs were evaluated in this study that included critical structures involved in neurocognitive functions along with major WM bundles and deep gray nuclei of bilateral cerebral hemispheres (Table 2). Out of these 98 ROIs, 64 consisted of GM regions, 32 were WM and two included lateral ventricles. The mean FA, AD, RD, MD, AK, RK, MK, KFA values for the 64 GM ROIs and mean MD, AK, RK, MK, and KFA values for 32 WM ROIs were then extracted using ROIEditor software.",

The level of significance of these parameters was also assessed in bilateral hippocampi using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. To see the relationship between the MMSE score and diffusional parameters, Pearsons correlation coefficient was calculated. The statistical analysis was accomplished using SPSS (SPSS Inc.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This prospective study has shown that there are significant alterations in many brain anatomical regions in AzD patients as demonstrated by DKI and DTI parameters. This study had the advantage of using whole-brain atlas analysis rather than manual ROI-based analysis done in majority of the previous studies thus making it free of observer related errors. Furthermore, manual ROI analysis is a very exhaustive process and a clear hypothesis on the location of expected diffusion differences is needed.\nThis study has demonstrated that the extent of abnormalities in terms of number of ROIs involved in AzD patients was lesser for MK, AK and RK as compared to that of MD, AD, and RD in both GM and WM regions as also shown in a study by Yuan et al (21). Both DKI, as well as DTI parameters, were able to exhibit abnormalities in WM areas with complex fiber crossings as in corona radiata. In addition to that, DTI was able to demonstrate increased diffusivity in additional WM areas including internal capsule, external capsule and major WM bundles like superior longitudinal fasciculus, sagittal stratum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. Although unproven, a certain counterbalance between local neuronal loss and accumulation of Ab plaques possibly could be the reason for the lesser extent of decreased kurtosis. In simpler words, the deposition of Ab plaques may nullify the reduction in complexity of the microstructure caused by neuronal loss. Thus, it would be an interesting assumption that kurtosis indices are more specific to AzD-related pathology as the differences in kurtosis parameters were more limited and correlated with the areas in the brain primarily involved in memory. Additionally, FA DTI showed a significant difference in the right amygdala and right fornix which has not been described earlier. It very well correlates with the fact that amygdala and fornix play an important role in memory processing and can show microstructural changes in such patients.\nAs depicted earlier, kurtosis parameters showed reduced values in AzD patients with significant differences limited to those areas of the brain (including both GM and WM areas) that play an important role in cognition. These included bilateral hippocampi, bilateral thalami, bilateral hypothalami, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, bilateral cingulate gyri, and corpus callosum. Majority of these areas are a part of the limbic system and are well known to be affected in the course of AzD. These findings are in concordance with that of Yuan et al. (21) in which they have shown a decrease in MK, AK, RK and FA in patients with early AzD involving extensive WM and GM regions. Moreover, our study showed involvement of additional important relevant anatomic regions including bilateral mammillary bodies, bilateral fornices, bilateral entorhinal cortices, nucleus accumbens, insular cortex as well as lateral ventricles among others. Mammillary body and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract are important for recollection memory. It plays an important role in spatial and episodic memory (22). Similarly, fornix is an important structure in limbic system forming the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network. Insula in addition to its other functions makes reciprocal connections with the limbic system. It mediates long term retention of appetitive, aversive or novelty driven learning. The involvement of insula in memory is dependent on the saliency of the cues and events, which is marked through dopaminergic or cholinergic signaling (23).\nComparatively, MD was elevated in larger number of GM ROIs as compared to DKI metrics. This finding is similar to that observed in WM ROIs indicating greater sensitivity of DTI metrics in both WM as well as GM.\nAnother remarkable finding was significantly increased kurtosis metrics in the right putamen and increased RK in bilateral Globus pallidus in patients as compared to controls. However, the corresponding decrease in diffusivity was not seen in DTI parameters. It is a well-known fact that the lentiform nucleus is involved in the susceptible neuronal circuits that are prone to degeneration during progression to AzD (24). In addition, it has been shown in post mortem studies that Ab plaques are also found in parietal, temporal, prefrontal cortices as well as striatum in the brain of AzD patients (25). Therefore, increased kurtosis in the putamen and GP can be explained by the fact that there might be increased Ab accumulation in these areas with lesser neuronal loss.\nIt was also observed that the kurtosis values were significantly lower in patients as compared to controls in lateral ventricles. A similar finding has also been demonstrated in a study by Xue et al (26). It has been seen that aquaporin 4 plays a critical role in the clearance of Ab and changes in aquaporin 4 expression have been confirmed in patients with AzD (27,28). The lateral ventricle contains choroid plexus which strongly express aquaporin 4 (29). So, the difference in diffusion between cases and controls could be explained by changes in aquaporin 4 expression.\nHippocampus is a key structure known to be primarily involved in AzD. Therefore, ROC curve analysis was performed for DKI and MD values in bilateral hippocampi. It revealed AK had the highest specificity in diagnosing AzD, implying axonal degeneration to be an important pathophysiological mechanism in the disease process. In further reinforces the previously discussed fact that kurtosis parameters represent more specific microstructural changes for AzD as compared to DTI metrics. Also, it is worth noting that there was substantial positive and negative correlation of MMSE score with DKI and DTI parameters respectively. This significant correlation indicates that the cognitive decline of AzD patients can be attributed to microstructural changes such as axonal loss or demyelination in the WM. AK had maximum positive correlation with MMSE score as depicted earlier.\nThe fact that AK had maximum specificity as well as positive correlation with MMSE score, indirectly suggests that axonal degeneration might be an important aberration occurring at microstrucrural level. This substantial correlation also suggests that these DKIDTI parameters can help in assessing the severity of the disease and even in early diagnosis at amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage.\nLimitations of the study include relatively smaller number of patients enrolled in our study (n  27). Therefore, studies with a larger sample using this DKI method are needed. Secondly, MMSE score was used for neurocognitive assessment of the patient which can be affected by various unrelated factors like age and years of education. Another limitation was that no comparison was done with other types of dementia and few patients may also have a mixed type of dementia which becomes a difficult diagnosis to make.\nIn conclusion, this explorative study in AzD patients has demonstrated that there are significant abnormalities which can be detected by DKI and DTI imaging in several anatomical regions of the brain in AzD patients. The changes in the diffusivity parameters are more extensive and widespread as compared to the kurtosis parameters which are more specific and correlate with the areas in the brain primarily involved in memory. Additionally, substantial correlation of DKI parameter with MMSE score also suggests that DKI method can provide sensitive imaging biomarker to evaluate the severity of cognitive impairment.",

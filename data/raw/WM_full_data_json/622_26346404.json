    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: We analyzed the ability of a machine learning approach that uses diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) structural connectomes to determine lateralization of epileptogenicity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Materials and Methods: We analyzed diffusion tensor and 3-dimensional (3D) T 1weighted images of 44 patients with TLE (right, 15, left, 29; mean age, 33.0  11.6 years) and 14 age-matched controls. We constructed a whole brain structural connectome for each subject, calculated graph theoretical network measures, and used a support vector machine (SVM) for classification among 3 groups (right TLE versus controls, left TLE versus controls, and right TLE versus left TLE) following a feature reduction process with sparse linear regression. Results: In left TLE, we found a significant decrease in local efficiency and the clustering coefficient in several brain regions, including the left posterior cingulate gyrus, left cuneus, and both hippocampi. In right TLE, the right hippocampus showed reduced nodal degree, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency. With use of the leave-one-out crossvalidation strategy, the SVM classifier achieved accuracy of 75.9 to 89.7 for right TLE versus controls, 74.4 to 86.0 for left TLE versus controls, and 72.7 to 86.4 for left TLE versus right TLE. Conclusion: Machine learning of graph theoretical measures from the DTI structural connectome may give support to lateralization of the TLE focus. The present good discrimination between left and right TLE suggests that, with further refinement, the classifier should improve presurgical diagnostic confidence.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent type of refractory focal epilepsy. Patients with concordant findings from electroencephalography (EEG), seizure semiology, neuropsychologi-cal assessment, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-such as atrophy and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity of the hippocampus ipsilateral to the side of seizure onset-do extremely well with resection of the mesial temporal structures. 1 Therefore, establishing the laterality of the epileptogenic focus with as much certainty as possible is an important task in the preoperative evaluation of patients with TLE. Howev-er, standard MR imaging protocols may fail to show an identifiable hippocampal abnormality or may provide only subtle findings that remain inconclusive. To increase the certainty of lateralization of the epileptogenic focus and obviate the need for invasive intracranial electrode placement, prior studies have investigated the utility of quantitative or automated MR image analyses, including voxelbased morphometry, 2,3 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 3,4 and functional MR imaging (fMRI). 5 DTI can approximate the white matter architecture by describing the directionality and magnitude of water diffusion. In TLE, the decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) tends to be maximal at the epileptic zone and subtle at a distance, 6 and decreased FA in the extra-temporal regions as well as within the ipsilateral temporal lobe suggests that the network is altered. 7 Recently, in light of several studies relating the presence of extratemporal abnormalities to poor postsurgical outcome, emphasis has shifted to consider epilepsy as a disorder of a widespread brain network. 8 Graph theoretical analysis of brain connectomes has attracted much interest as a method of network analysis suitable for epilepsy research. 8,9 In graph theory terms, a brain network, or connectome, consists of the set of neural elements (nodes) and their interconnections (edges). 10 Nodes usually represent brain regions, whereas edges represent (structural or functional) connections. A set of parameters that characterize specific topological properties of the network can be obtained from graph theoretical analyses of a brain connectome. Several studies have analyzed DTI-based structural connectomes in TLE; the majority have reported altered connectivity to be most prominent within the ipsilateral temporal lobe. 1112131415 In recent years, several studies have investigated the performance of machine learning algorithms, such as that of the support vector machine (SVM), for automatic localization of epileptogenic foci using MR voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 2,3 and fMRI. 5 Because graph theory metrics use a subset of numeric parameters to summarize the characteristic properties of huge and complex brain networks, they are mathematically good candidates for a machine learning approach to identify the multivariate feature combinations that best predict an outcome of interest. A combination of machine learning and connectomic measures has been used to distinguish healthy individuals from patients with disorders including autism, 16 schizophrenia, 17 and Alzheimers disease. 18 In this context, we examined the performance of a machine learning approach, used in combination with DTI-derived structural connectomes, to determine lateralization of the epileptogenic focus of the TLE.",

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the patients. Patients were included if they had received a clinical diagnosis of TLE and been referred for neuroimaging (including DTI) as part of an evaluation for surgical indication. For the purpose of this study, we excluded patients with a mass lesion or destructive changes, such as contusion or infarction. In addition to evaluating clinical history, seizure semiology and MR imaging, we conducted a comprehensive review of long duration video-EEG recordings (31 of 44 patients), intracranial EEG recordings (14 of 44 patients), positron emission tomography (PET) (39 of 44 patients), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (36 of 44 patients) for diagnosis and lateralization of the seizure focus to the left or right temporal lobe. We recruited 14 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (6 men, 8 women; mean age, 31.3  8.1 years), who were required to have no neurological or psychological symptoms, history of neurologic diseases, or apparent abnormalities observed on conventional MR images.\nOur institutional review board approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent from patients for the retrospective analyses. Written informed consent was obtained from all the healthy volunteers.",

We used FreeSurfer software (Version 5; http:surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to parcellate the cortical surface, segment gray and white matter, and define 83 regions of interest (ROIs) (41 regions in each hemisphere and one corresponding to the brainstem) with the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. 20 The regions were then transformed into each subjects DTI space using boundary-based linear registration (bbregister). All processed images were inspected visually for any artifacts, segmentation, or registration errors. Diffusion tensor reconstruction and whole brain deterministic tractography were performed with Diffusion Toolkit software (http:www.trackvis.orgdtk) on the basis of the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm (threshold angle, 60). Finally, for each subject, a connectivity adjacency matrix A with 83  83 entries was generated, with A ij corresponding to the weighted connectivity between structures i and j (Fig. 1). Because we observed that the vast majority of the regional pairs were assigned zero and represented sparse networks, we applied no thresholding to the weighted connectivity matrices here. We calculated graph measures for each individual connectivity matrix using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https:sites.google.com sitebctnet). We used the degree (k), clustering coefficient (C), local efficiency (E), and betweenness centrality (b) to describe the nodal properties of the brain network on the basis of the results of prior studies. 5,12131415 Table 2 provides definitions of the metrics. 21",

In patients with left TLE, we found 6 brain regions with significant reductions in local efficiency and the clustering coefficient, namely the right paracentral gyrus, right pericalcarine gyrus, left posterior cingulate gyrus, left cuneus, and both hippocampi. We also observed a significant decrease of local efficiency in the left isthmus of the cingulate. In patients with right TLE, the right hippocampus showed reductions in the nodal degree, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency. In addition, patients with left TLE and those with right TLE showed nonsignificant reductions in the clustering coefficient and local efficiency in the temporoparietal lobes, including the default mode network (DMN) (Fig. 2). Compared with right TLE, left TLE appeared to be associated with more extensive alteration of graph measures, including in the contralateral hemisphere.\nThe nodal parameters identified as discriminating factors for SVM were predominantly distributed in the limbic or DMN areas (Table 5). When we applied the LOOCV strategy using a comprehensive review of seizure semiology, EEG, PET, and SPECT as the gold standard for lateralization, the SVM classifier achieved accuracy of 75.9 to 89.7 for right TLE versus controls, 74.4 to 86.0 for left TLE versus controls, and 72.7 to 86.4 for left TLE versus right TLE (Table 6).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, use of an SVM and graph theory measures demonstrated 72.7 to 86.4 classification accuracy for left TLE versus right TLE, with an AUC of 0.82 to 0.91. These results were comparable to those of previous studies that used machine learning approaches for volumetry, DTI, and fMRI. 2345 Although our results for classification accuracy do not exceed those of previous reports that applied machine learning to DTI using voxel-based approaches 3 or a fractional anisotropy (FA) skeleton generated by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), 4 the graph-based approach has considerable strengths as follows. First, it is directed to the recent trend to consider diseases of the brain as network disorders. 232425 Second, the number of feature characteristics becomes too large in the voxelbased or skeleton-based methods, making feature selection difficult and resulting in expensive computational cost. In contrast, the graph theory summarizes the network properties with a set of relatively few numerical metrics. Third, we can compare networks across various modalities, such as EEG, volumetry, surface-based morphometry, DTI, and fMRI, using graph metrics. With regard to classification accuracy, considering that we used DTI data with only 13 motion-probing gradient (MPG) directions, the use of more dedicated DTI schemes (e.g., Q-ball and diffusion spectrum imaging) and probabilistic tractography is likely to improve classification accuracy. 26 Comparisons of patients with TLE with normal controls revealed alterations of graph descriptors distributed predominantly in the ipsilateral temporoparietal lobe, including areas of the DMN. Our results are in accord with the reported network alteration in TLE demonstrated by fMRI, 27,28 supporting the validity of graph analyses using a DTI structural connectome. They are also in line with those of previous reports utilizing graph analyses to assess the DTI structural connectome. 1112131415 We did not observe the reported paradoxical increase in clustering coefficient or local efficiency, 12,13 and there has been some variation in the reported alteration of the clustering coefficient in patients with TLE. 28 One possible explanation for this discrep-ancy is that the clustering coefficient depends on the stage of disease; indeed, it has been reported to increase during most of the sclerotic process and decrease in the final stages of disease. 29 As for differences between left and right TLE, most studies have reported a stronger impact of left TLE on network function as assessed by DTI 7,15 and restingstate fMRI, 27 as in this study. Although the reason for the preferential vulnerability of the left hemisphere is unclear, one plausible explanation is that it is related to interference by the disease with for- mation of the language network. 15 It has been suggested that 3 factors will determine the practical utility of a connectome-based classifier-accurate and robust prediction, clinically informative outcome that cannot be predicted using other means, and predictive accuracy superior to that of other simpler and less expensive measures. 10 With regard to the first factor, the ROC analyses indicated moderate to high accuracy for prediction of TLE laterality. As to the second, the machine learning approach may reduce the incidence of hippocampal sclerosis being missed at nonspecialized institutions 30,31 and may help predict postoperative seizure control in the future. 11 Regarding the third factor, although our study was not designed to compare the effectiveness of the connectome classifier with that of FDG-PET or video-EEG monitoring, its good discrimination between left and right TLE suggests that, with further refinement, the classifier may improve presurgical diagnostic confidence and can contribute to obviating the need for invasive intracranial electrode placement.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the homogeneity of the patient group was not entirely guaranteed, considering the controversy about whether TLE without hippocampal sclerosis is a distinct neurobiological entity. 32 However, we enrolled these MRI-negative patients because they would benefit most from a quantitative classification technique. Second, we cannot rule out a confounding effect of antiepileptic medications that may change diffusion properties. Third, from a methodological viewpoint, our results from DTI connectomes should be interpreted carefully. This is because the streamline counts generated by tractography do not quantify connection strengths whether probabilistic or deterministic tractography is applied, and no alternative has been established to overcome this intrinsic limitation. 10,33 The other methodological concern is the thresholding of the graph. 10 Generally, a weighted connectome needs to undergo a thresholding process because weak and spurious connections may obscure the topology of the true significant networks, but defining a threshold also introduces arbitrariness. We chose to use no thresholding in consideration of the sparsity of the generated connectome (probably due to the small numbers of motion-probing gradients) and expectation that the feature selection process would identify robust discriminating features less dependent on such spurious connections.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that machine learning of graph theoretical measures of the DTI structural connectome is a promising tool for discriminating left and right TLE. Optimization of the DTI acquisition scheme and machine learning algorithms, including the feature selection method, should further improve classification accuracy.",

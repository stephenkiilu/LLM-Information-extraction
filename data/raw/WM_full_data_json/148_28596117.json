    "abstract": "The e4 allelic variant of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE e4) is the best-established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). White matter (WM) microstructural damages measured with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) represent an early sign of fiber tract disconnection in AD. We examined the impact of APOE e4 on WM microstructure in elderly individuals from the multicenter European DTI Study on Dementia. Voxelwise statistical analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial and axial diffusivity (MD, radD and axD respectively) was carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Seventyfour healthy elderly individuals -31 APOE e4 carriers (APOE e4) and 43 APOE e4 non-carriers (APOE e4À) -were considered for data analysis. All the results were corrected for scanner acquisition protocols, age, gender and for multiple comparisons. APOE e4 and APOE e4À subjects were comparable regarding sociodemographic features and global cognition. A significant reduction of FA and increased radD was found in the APOE e4 compared to the APOE e4À in the cingulum, in the corpus callosum, in the inferior fronto-occipital and in the inferior longitudinal fasciculi, internal and external capsule. APOE e4, compared to APOE e4À showed higher MD in the genu, right internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus and corona radiate. Comparisons stratified by center supported the results obtained on the whole sample. These findings support previous evidence in monocentric studies indicating a modulatory role of APOE e4 allele on WM microstructure in elderly individuals at risk for AD suggesting early vulnerability andor reduced resilience of WM tracts involved in AD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "The APOE gene, located on chromosome 19q13.2, encodes the ApoE protein (Boyles et al., 1985;Nakai et al., 1996). ApoE participates in lipid metabolism, particularly in cholesterol transport and clearance. Moreover, its activity is associated with relevant components of brain white matter (WM) such as myelin, of which cholesterol is a major constituent (Westlye et al., 2012). It is also implicated in neuronal growth and repair, nerve regeneration, immune response, and activation of lipolytic enzymes (Karch et al., 2014;Yu et al., 2014). At present, the e4 allelic variant of APOE -APOE e4 -is the best established genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimers Disease (AD) (Corder et al., 1993;Strittmatter et al., 1993). The involvement of genetic risk factors such as APOE e4 in sporadic lateonset AD has been profoundly demonstrated (Saunders et al., 1993;Sherrington et al., 1995;Bertram et al., 2007;Reitz et al., 2011;Lockhart and DeCarli, 2014).\nStructural neuroimaging patterns related to APOE e4 in elderly individuals described gray matter atrophy in the medial temporal structures (Chen et al., 2007;Donix et al., 2010b;Hua et al., 2010;Risacher et al., 2010;Lu et al., 2011;Roussotte et al., 2014) such as the subiculum (Burggren et al., 2008;Suthana et al., 2010) and CA1 subfield (Kerchner et al., 2014) of the hippocampus (Donix et al., 2010a;Chiang et al., 2011;ODwyer et al., 2012;Taylor et al., 2014), although contrasting results were published as well (Jack et al., 1998;Du et al., 2006;Schuff et al., 2009;Taylor et al., 2014). Moreover, higher cortical beta-amyloid deposition (Reiman et al., 2009;Morris et al., 2010;Fleisher et al., 2013), glucose hypometabolism in brain regions typically impaired in AD (Rimajova et al., 2008;Protas et al., 2013;Fouquet et al., 2014) and changes in brain function during an encoding memory task (Filippini et al., 2011) were previously described in elderly cognitively intact individuals carrying the APOE e4 allele. No interaction effects of APOE e4 status were found on the relationship between brain beta-amyloid levels and gray matter network disruption (Tijms et al., 2016). So far, the exact pathophysiological mechanism through which APOE e4 contributes to the etiology and progression of the disease remains unclear.\nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that APOE e4 allele is associated with axonal degeneration (Tesseur et al., 2000) and structural modifications in intracellular microtubules (Nathan et al., 1995), thereby raising the possibility of mechanistically impacting WM microstructure (Heise et al., 2011(Heise et al., , 2014;;Westlye et al., 2012). More than half of the individuals diagnosed with AD display WM microstructural alterations (Chalmers et al., 2005) that can be investigated in vivo by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).\nDTI detects the amplitude and directional coherence of water molecule diffusion and, since water molecule diffusion is usually constrained along the main fiber direction by axonal membranes and myelin sheaths, this feature can be used to measure WM structural integrity (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996;Behrens et al., 2007). In particular, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) measures are generally high in healthy, structurally intact, coherently organized WM tissues (Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, 2014). However, there was also evidence of reduced FA in healthy cognitively intact adults in region of crossing fibers between the corticospinal tract and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Douaud et al., 2011) as previously reported also in diseased tissue (Amlien and Fjell, 2014). Moreover, high mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (radD) and axial diffusivity (axD) measures may potentially be used to detect tissue breakdown, myelin loss and axonal injury respectively (Beaulieu, 2002;Song et al., 2002Song et al., , 2005;;Kumar et al., 2011Kumar et al., , 2013)).\nPrevious studies investigating DTI indexes in AD patients showed a consistent pattern of decreased FA and increased MD, radD and axD, suggesting the presence of WM tracts disconnection in this population (Amlien and Fjell, 2014;Zhang et al., 2014). Although brain WM integrity, in older adults carrying APOE e4, has been previously investigated in several monocentric studies (Gold et al., 2012;Felsky and Voineskos, 2013;Lyall et al., 2014), the reproducibility of these results in multicenter studies has not been sufficiently examined.\nIn the present study, we investigated how the APOE e4 variant alters the brain WM microstructure in healthy older individuals recruited in the European multicenter DTI Study on Dementia (EDSD).",

      "text": "Sociodemographic, clinical and neuroimaging data were selected from the retrospective multicenter European Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study on Dementia (EDSD) database (Teipel et al., 2011(Teipel et al., , 2012(Teipel et al., , 2014;;Fischer et al., 2012;Dyrba et al., 2013Dyrba et al., , 2014Dyrba et al., , 2015;;Kilimann et al., 2014;Kljajevic et al., 2014;Tsao et al., 2014;Brueggen et al., 2015Brueggen et al., , 2016)). The EDSD is a framework created to study the multicenter variability and diagnostic accuracy of DTI derived markers in patients with prodromal AD and AD dementia. It was founded in 2010 and is coordinated by the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Rostock (Germany). Initially, MRI data, including DTI sequences of healthy control subjects (HC) and AD patients, were retrospectively collected from 10 European centers leading in the field of AD research.\nThe EDSD database has collected data from eleven European centers: Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Brescia (Italy), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Dublin (Ireland), Frankfurt (Germany), Freiburg (Germany), Milan (Italy), Mainz (Germany), Mannheim (Germany), Munich (Germany), and Rostock (Germany). As of March 2016, the EDSD sample consists of 139 AD patients, 160 Mild Cognitive Impairment patients and 194 healthy controls. An inclusion criterion for each center in order to upload the data of HC required that they were free of cognitive impairment. Healthy subjects were recruited via advertisement, e.g. in newspapers. During anamnesis and neuropsychological assessment it was ruled out that they had cognitive complaints or medical diseases, including neurological and psychiatric diseases (such as depression or substance abuse). In the present study, we selected 85 healthy control individuals that underwent APOE genotyping conducted according to the standard methods derived from Amsterdam (renamed Center 1), Dublin (Center 2), Munich (Center 3), and Rostock (Center 4). Quality control of DTI scans was done visually to exclude scans with conspicuous artifacts such as ghosting, blurring due to motion, or strong susceptibility artifacts, and scans on which the brain was not entirely delimited within the field of view. Because of poorincomplete head coverage preventing the creation of the mean FA image and its skeleton, 20 DTI scans were excluded from analysis. The sample was subsequently enriched by integrating 9 supplementary DTI scans of individuals carrying APOE e4 coming from Rostock center. The analysis was carried out on 74 healthy cognitively normal older individuals categorized into 31 APOE e4 carriers (APOE e4) and 43 APOE e4 non-carriers (APOE e4À). All procedures were followed in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, and the applicable revisions at the time of the investigation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee in each participating center. Written informed consent was provided from all participants or their representatives.",

      "text": "The DTI toolbox of FSL (4.1) (available at http:www. fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl) was used for the DTI data preprocessing. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA data was carried out using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (Smith et al., 2004)), part of FSL (Smith, 2002). First, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using FDT, and then brain-extracted using BET (Smith, 2002). All subjects FA data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (www.fmrib.ox.ac. ukanalysistechrep), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999). Next, the mean FA image was created and thinned to create a mean FA skeleton, thresholded at FA 0.2, which represents the centers of all tracts common to the group. Each subjects aligned FA data were then projected onto the skeleton. In addition, the nonlinear warps and the skeleton projection achieved with FA images were applied to the MD, radD and axD maps to bring them into standard space (Jovicich et al., 2014). Finally, data fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistics.\nMoreover, an atlas-based ROI analysis for FA, MD and radD maps was performed in the WM tracts resulted significance from voxelwise cross-subject statistics. In particular, we focused on the corpus callosum (genu, body and splenium), the internal and external capsule, the inferior fronto-occipital and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, the cingulum, the right corona radiata, the right posterior thalamic radiation and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. These WM ROIs are pre-defined in the JHU-ICBM-FA-1 mm atlas. We back-projected the ROIs with a non-linear co-registration to each subjects FA map in the MNI152 space obtained from TBSS. Each ROI label was overlapped with the FA TBSS skeleton space to remove any CSF and gray matter voxels. These new ROIs were then used in each subjects FA, MD and radD maps (MNI152 space) to extract the FA, MD and radD metrics in each abovementioned tract (Jovicich et al., 2014). Individuals head motion was extracted from each DTI acquisition using the tool FLIRT from FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2002).",

Group differences between APOE e4 and APOE e4À were assessed using the Chi-Square test for categorical variables and using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. For global and tract-related FA, MD, radD and axD mean values as well as motion, group differences were adjusted for site, age and gender using linear regression. At first, the group by age interaction was added in the linear models and it was tested for global and specific WM tracts. The interaction was removed when no significant effect was detected. Effects were tested using likelihood ratio test. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Cohens f 2 was used to measure the effect size of APOE e4 status for global metrics and specific WM tracts. Moreover, stratification by centers was performed to assess group differences in DTI global metrics. For this analysis the Mann-Whitney Utest was used and the effect size was calculated as proposed by Cohen according to the following formula: zsqrt(N). P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.3.2. TBSS: General Linear Model. First, design matrix and contrast for the general linear model were generated including center, gender and age as covariate (Number Then, voxelwise statistics of DTI images were performed using the randomise FSL tool for nonparametric statistical thresholding (Nichols and Holmes, 2002) using the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement option. The number of permutations was set at 5000 (Nichols and Holmes, 2002). MD, FA, axD, and radD values within the skeleton were compared between APOE e4 and APOE e4À groups controlling for the family-wise error (FWE) rate (two tailed, p  0.05).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In the present study, we explored the impact of the APOE e4 genotype on WM microstructure in cognitively intact older adults recruited in the EDSD multicenter study. To our knowledge this is the first multicenter study investigating a broad range of WM microstructure indices on a population of cognitively healthy elderly Evidence has shown an increased risk to develop AD in elderly individuals carrying APOE e4. In particular, evidence have reported in APOE e4 heterozygotes individuals compared to APOE e3 homozygotes a risk of developing AD of 4 times higher above 60 years old (Reinvang et al., 2013). Furthermore, previous studies described how cognitively intact and mild cognitive impairment individuals carrying APOE e4 compared to APOE e4 non-carriers had an increase in brain beta-amyloid and tau load (Reiman et al., 2009;Small et al., 2009;Morris et al., 2010), the two major pathophysiological hallmarks of AD. This evidence highlights the importance of investigating indices of WM microstructure related to population of older age adults at high risk to develop AD.\nDespite our data were collected at multicentric level in a non-homogenized clinical settings using different DTI acquisition protocols, our findings are generally consistent with previous DTI studies, showing alterations of cerebral WM in elderly APOE e4 compared with APOE e4À individuals (Persson et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2010;Heise et al., 2011;Ryan et al., 2011). We found a lower WM integrity in individuals carrying APOE e4 in WM tracts characteristically associated with early AD pathology, such as the corpus callosum, the cingulum, and the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi (Medina et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006;Xie et al., 2006;Firbank et al., 2007;Huang et al., 2007;Sydykova et al., 2007;Teipel et al., 2007;Filippini et al., 2009;Tsao et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2016). In particular, in agreement with previous evidence, we found lower FA and higher radD values in e4 carriers compared to non-carriers in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum (Persson et al., 2006;Smith et al., 2010;Ryan et al., 2011;Adluru et al., 2014;Tsao et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2016). This finding also agrees with prior MRI studies observing macroscopic WM lesions in both normal aging (Bartzokis, 2004;Filippini et al., 2009) and AD patients (Janowsky et al., 1996;Teipel et al., 2003) in the corpus callosum. Morphological differences in the corpus callosum may point to regional and cell-type-specific neuronal neurodegeneration (Hampel et al., 1998); indeed, WM fibers of the splenium originate from the temporoparietal regions (Conturo et al., 1999), which are characteristically affected in the early stages of AD (Thompson et al., 2001;Ewers et al., 2011a).\nIn agreement with previous studies, using the same method, we found a significant widespread reduction of FA in the posterior portion of cingulum, in the inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi in elderly nondemented APOE e4 participants (Heise et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2015).\nIn line with previous literature results, cognitively intact individuals carrying APOE e4 showed a significant increase in MD in the genu of corpus callosum (Heise et al., 2011), in the corona radiata, internal capsule and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Heise et al., 2011;Westlye et al., 2012;Adluru et al., 2014). A study conducted on a smaller sample of elderly individuals carrying APOE e4 from the EDSD database (Kljajevic et al., 2014) reported a modest effect of APOE e4 on MD in the lentiform nucleus in healthy controls comparing APOE e4 with APOE e4À. The number of overlapping subjects between the present work and the one of Kljajevic and colleagues was 35 out of 74 subjects considered in the present manuscript. These inconsistent DTI findings may be partially due to the small sample size and the use of different methods (such as FSL, SPM).\nIn addition, a significantly increased radD in elderly APOE e4 individuals was detected. Few studies investigating this marker in APOE e4 carriers have been conducted so far. Our results are in line with the findings described in the manuscript by Westlye and colleagues (2012), showing an increased radial diffusivity in APOE e4 compared to APOE e4À. Interestingly, preliminary results showed an increase in radial diffusivity in elderly individuals at risk of AD, defined as the presence of APOE e4 and family history of dementia, thus raising the possibility that reduced WM integrity may contribute to AD onset (Ewers et al., 2011b;Gold et al., 2012). Decreased FA and increased radD were found in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus which indicates a substantial involvement of WM fibers connecting the occipital and medial temporal lobe regions (Catani et al., 2003), including the amygdalahippocampal head regions anteriorly and the ventral visual association areas posteriorly. It is well known that these tracts -involved in face recognition (Fox et al., 2008), visual perception (ffytche and Catani, 2005) and visual memory processing (Ross, 2008) -are affected in AD (Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, a recent study showed as healthy elderly APOE e4 carriers exhibited topographical alterations in both WM and functional networks, in particular with a reduced efficiency in the parahippocampal gyrus mediated by the effect of APOE variants on memory performances (Chen et al., 2015). In addition, a further study found shorter neuronal fiber bundle lengths in the left uncinate fasciculus of APOE e4 carriers related to severe deficits in semantic memory (Yasmin et al., 2008).\nThe comparison between APOE e4 and APOE e4À within centers revealed a trend in each subgroup of decreased FA and increased MD, axD and radD in the APOE e4 groups. This evidence supports the claim that the overall effect is not due to center effects and that the investigation of indexes of WM microstructure at multicenter level, using different MRI protocols of acquisition, is feasible and lead to results previously replicated at monocentric level. However, previous studies showed that DTI scalar measurements are dependent on several factors, among them: the use of different b values, the number of diffusion directions and the voxel size. In particular, a study detecting any dependency of the FA values on the applied b-value, found significantly different mean FA values between the DTI acquisitions using a b-value of 700 smm2 and those using a b-value of 1000 smm2 in the genu of right internal capsule and the anterior limb of left internal capsule (Bisdas et al., 2008). In our study most of the centers presented a similar b-value. Center 4 displayed substantial higher FA values compared to the FA values of other Centers. Previous studies have shown that FA values are mainly affected by changes in the number of gradients and voxel resolution (Barrio-Arranz et al., 2015). In particular, high voxel size resulted in decreasing FA average. Center 4 shows a lower voxel size compared to other centers indicating a likely impact in increasing FA values. Moreover, a high number of gradient directions were shown to decrease FA (Jones, 2004). Our findings are in line with these previous results displaying decrease FA in the center with less gradient directions.\nDespite the above results, findings on the effect of APOE e4 in cognitively normal older individuals are still inconclusive, including studies describing no significant impact of the APOE e4 allele on WM microstructure damages in middle-aged (Bendlin et al., 2010) and older (Nyberg and Salami, 2014) cognitively intact individuals. Furthermore, our results did not report any interaction between age and APOE as described in previous studies (Heise et al., 2011;Westlye et al., 2012), however contrasting results were reported (Adluru et al., 2014).\nSome limitations of the present study need to be addressed. Firstly, due to the small sample size we cannot generalize our results. Secondly, due to the potentially limited anatomical specificity of the TBSS method (Bach et al., 2014), further analyses should be performed with additional techniques. For instance, the DTI tractography dissection method (Catani et al., 2002) followed by a manual correction preformed by expert anatomists would allow to carry out more accurate measurements of WM structures close to the cortical gray matter or subcortical nuclei such as the fornix and the uncinate (Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, 2014). In addition, this manuscript does not investigate more potentially sensitive indices of WM microstructure such as those from the NODDI model (Zhang et al., 2012) and from the advanced spherical deconvolution, such as the HMOA index (DellAcqua et al., 2013). Then, although center was included as a covariate of no interest in the group comparisons, our results might be affected by the different protocols of DTI acquisition used in each center. However, previous physical and clinical phantom studies based also on the EDSD database have revealed limited variability of DTI data when some minimal standards of acquisition are met (Landman et al., 2007;Teipel et al., 2011). Finally, we would like to underline that the multicenter nature of the EDSD study might not be the ideal condition to investigate the effect of APOE e4 genotype on the WM microstructure, however at the same time the multicenter structure of the EDSD study allows the use of DTI among scanners and clinical settings. This is an essential aspect for the translation of imaging markers from the research bench to the clinical context.\nIn conclusion, this is the first multicenter study investigating a large spectrum of DTI indexes of WM microstructure. Despite the multicenter and not harmonized nature of EDSD DTI data, our findings support previous evidence regarding the impact of the APOE e4 genotype on WM integrity in cognitively intact older individuals. In particular, an early alteration of WM in the corpus callosum, in the cingulum, and in the inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi was found. These findings suggest that a reduction of WM tracts integrity may represent early pathological changes related to underlying AD pathology in healthy elderly individuals carrying APOE e4 (Hampel et al., 2010). In view of the heterogeneity of results previously described in the literature, our study adds information on possible causes of inter-individual WM heterogeneity that may be genetically determined by the presence of APOE genotype. Future studies should be conducted in even larger cohorts of subjects carrying APOE e4 alleles both at preclinical and prodromal levels of AD progression in order to further clarify the effect of APOE e4 on WM microstructure damages throughout the entire AD continuum.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Our aim was to determine diffusion abnormalities in the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in Alzheimers disease (AD) by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) using a new method for measuring the core of the tract. Methods We studied 19 patients with AD and 19 agematched control subjects who underwent MRI using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of the UF was generated. The mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the core of the tract were measured after voxelized tract shape processing. Students t-test was used to compare results between patients with AD and controls. Intraobserver correlation tests were also performed. Results FA was significantly lower (P0.0001) in the UF of patients with AD than of controls. There was no significant difference in MD along the UF between the two groups. Intraobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) for the first and second measurement was r0.93 for measured FA and r0.92 for measured MD. Conclusion Our results suggest that FA reflects progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the UF of the white matter and may represent a useful biological index in monitoring AD. Diffusion tensor tract-specific analysis with voxelized tract shape processing to measure the core of the tract may be a sensitive tool for evaluation of diffusion abnormalities of white matter tracts in AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. It is the most common type of dementia. Neuroimaging research has suggested that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might serve as a more sensitive and consistent measure of disease progression than the neuropsychological and cognitive assessments that are typically used in present-day research. Among the pathological changes in AD, several white matter (WM) abnormalities such as rarefaction, loss of axons and oligodendrocytes, and reactive astrocytosis have been observed 1. In line with these observations, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) studies 23456 have also shown microscopic WM changes in patients with AD that are not detected by conventional MRI; however, the precise topography and extent of these WM changes remain a topic of debate.\nDTI is a noninvasive technique that enables the user to visualize in three dimensions and quantify the organization and integrity of white matter fiber tracts in the human brain in vivo 7,8. Diffusion tensor-derived parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) can thus describe the microarchitectural characteristics of local brain tissue, and mapping of these parameters can be used to depict pathological changes in the cerebral white matter. Several recent reports have shown that mapping of diffusion parameters is potentially useful in diagnosing AD 2,3,5,9101112131415161718. DTI can characterize the properties of water diffusion in the brain by providing three types of information: the extent (apparent diffusion constant, ADC) and directionality (anisotropy) of diffusion, and its predominant orientation 7,19. ADC and anisotropy are believed to be related predominantly to the integrity of axonal tracts 20,21, and depict contrast that is different from that in conventional T1-and T2-weighted images 19. Tract-specific analysis (TSA) by DTI is one of the most promising image-processing techniques that enables visualization of fiber pathways in the brain as well as quantitative analysis of specific fiber bundles 222324. There is considerable interest in DTI-based TSA because it may enable an improved understanding of the disruptions in connections between brain regions, which have otherwise yet to be quantitatively evaluated.\nPrevious studies indicate that AD is associated with changes in the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes 10,17. The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a white matter tract that connects the anterior part of the temporal lobe with the orbital and polar frontal cortex; it is believed to play a role in emotion, decision-making and episodic memory, and in the pathophysiology of AD 22,252627.\nSeveral experimental studies have shown that the UF is a monosynaptic corticocortical route of interaction between the temporal and frontal lobes. Review of many experimental studies supports the role of the UF as one of several connections whose disruption results in severe memory impairment 26,28. The disruption in connectivity between the temporal and frontal lobes via the UF is postulated as a possible cause of posttraumatic retrograde amnesia 26,29.\nThe aim of the present study was to perform a tractspecific assessment of diffusion properties of the UF in patients with AD in comparison with normal controls. Until now it has been difficult to evaluate only a specific tract of interest. No method has successfully minimized partial volume effects in TSA, and a reconstructed fiber tract is always associated with incidental artifactual lines. We propose a new technique for measuring the core of the tract in TSA using the erosion method, which eliminates incidental artifactual lines and partial volume effects.",

      "text": "From a consecutive series of 55 subjects enrolled in a prospective study of patients with AD and a chief complaint of dementia, we retrospectively selected 19 patients (11 female and 8 male; mean age 71.18.1 years, age range 55-81 years) who were diagnosed as probably having AD according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association 30. The patients had attended the Department of Radiology at the National Center Hospital for Mental, Nervous, and Muscular Disorders, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan, from March to July 2005. Three patients did not meet the criteria. Six patients who presented with major systemic, psychiatric or other neurological illness, or head trauma were excluded. Excluded from the study were 16 patients who presented with significant cerebrovascular diseases (cortical infarction, multiple lacunar lesions, leukoaraiosis or other lesions above Fazekas grade 1 31) on T2-weighted or FLAIR images, and 11 patients with an unsatisfactory DTI study due to artifacts originating from patient motion or metallic dental prostheses. Also recruited were 19 age-matched healthy controls (12 female and 7 male; mean age 69.05.3 years, age range 62-80 years) who did not have any neurological or psychiatric conditions, had no cognitive complaints, had a normal neurological examination, and were not taking any antipsychotic medications.\nWe obtained local ethics committee approval and written informed consent from all patients and healthy controls before initiation of the study.",

    "MRI acquisition": {
      "text": "All scans were performed using a 1.0-T MRI system (Magnetom Harmony; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard head coil. We obtained regular structural images prior to DTI acquisition that included T1-weighted spin echo images (TR 624 ms, TE 15 ms, matrix size 512416, FOV 230230 mm, slice thickness 5 mm, intersection gap 0.4 mm, number of acquisitions 1), T2-weighted turbo-spin echo images (TR 6,580 ms, TE 89 ms, matrix size 512 432, FOV 230230 mm, slice thickness 5 mm, intersection gap 0.4 mm, number of acquisitions 1), and FLAIR images (TR 9,100 ms, TE 104 ms, TI 2500 ms, matrix size 512 448, FOV 230230 mm, slice thickness 5 mm, intersection gap 0.4 mm, number of acquisitions 1). DTI was performed using a full tensor diffusion MRI sequence based on the spin-echo echo-planar technique (TR 8,400 ms, TE 113 ms, matrix size 128128, FOV 230 230 mm, slice thickness 3 mm with no gap). Images were obtained with both 12-directional diffusion encoding (b  700 smm 2 for each direction) and no diffusion encoding (b0 smm 2 ). To ensure high data reliability, a high signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by averaging images six times. A total of 40 sets of axial images were obtained covering the whole cerebrum. Scanning time for DTI was 11 min 7 s. DTI data postprocessing DTI data were transferred to an off-line workstation. Analysis was performed using dTV II and VOLUME-ONE 1.72 developed by Masutani et al. 32 (http:www. ut-radiology.umin.ac.jppeoplemasutanidTV.htm) running under Windows XP Professional (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Interpolation along the z-axis was performed to obtain isotropic data (voxel size 1.81.81.8 mm).\nWe created color-coded maps using 13 sets of images (12 sets of images with b 700 smm 2 , 1 set of images with b 0 smm 2 ). Green was assigned to anteroposterior, red to left-right, and blue to the craniocaudal direction in the axial, coronal, and sagittal slices 33. Color-coding of the fiber orientation enabled ready identification of major white matter tracts by comparison with previously published data on DTI of white matter association pathways 34.\nTractography of bilateral UF was performed using the two-ROI method 32,35. The seed ROIs were set in the anterior part of the UF in the coronal plane at the level of the anterior portion of the genu of the corpus callosum, just anterior to the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The target ROIs were set in the white matter in the coronal plane at the most anterior part of the temporal stem. The color-coded maps were used to place these ROIs into the UF tracts precisely and objectively. A reconstructed sagittal section of the color-coded map was used to determine reconstructed coronal sections at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1a). In the coronal slices, UF tracts were displayed as green. The relatively large seed ROI, including the entirety of the uncinate tracts, was placed manually on a reconstructed coronal color map section at the level of the genu of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Similarly, the relatively large target ROI, including the entirety of the UF, was placed manually on a reconstructed coronal section of the T2-weighted images at the level of the anterior temporal stem (Fig. 1c). DTT of the UF was then generated using the threshold values of line-tracking termination as FA 0.15 (Fig. 1d). The dTV II software provides a track-line voxelization function that extracts the tracking line of the white matter tract to the 3-D voxels while preserving the original tensor parameters. Voxelization along the UF tract was performed (Fig. 2a); all voxels including the tracked lines were encountered. We then used a shape-processing technique based on mathematical morphology 36 to reduce the partial volume effect of the peripheral portion of the tract. This technique also eliminated small incidental artifactual lines. Theoretically, there can be holes within the tracts, because even from a dense seed, fibers can be sparse. To fill up the holes, dilation is necessary. If we had voxelized the tract without dilation, some voxels could have been missed. So first we performed the closing operation (dilation, Fig. 2b, and first erosion) then we extracted the core (Fig. 2c, second erosion). The UF is relatively thin compared to voxel size. So simple erosion often leads to total disappearance of the ROI shape due to cavities within the ROI voxels. The FA and MD values in coregistered voxels were then calculated. The approximate diameters of the tracts in various steps of the above processes were also measured.\nOverall DTI data processing time was approximately 20 min per subject. Measurements were repeated 1 month after the first measurement. We also performed the DTT of the UF for every subject by the conventional method (as described by Taoka et al. 22). By this method, in order to remove the unwanted fibers we used avoidance at the level of the middle portion of the temporal lobe in the coronal section of the T2 weighted image. To compare our proposed new method (erosion technique) with the conventional method, we visually evaluated the voxelized tract of the UF according to the anatomical location of the fiber tract as evaluated by Kier et al. 26. We randomly selected ten subjects (five patients with AD, five controls). We graded the voxelized tract as grade 0 if none of the fibers was outside the anatomical location of the UF, and graded the tract as grade 1 if there were fibers outside the anatomical location of the UF.",

      "text": "Tractographies of the UF were obtained as semicircular tracts connecting the anterior part of the temporal lobe with the orbital and polar frontal cortex in all patients with AD and controls. The mean FA values were 0.380.018 for patients with AD and 0.420.027 for the controls (Fig. 3). Patients with AD had significantly lower mean FA values (P0.0001) than the control group. The mean MD values were 0.680.0310 -3 mm 2 s for patients with AD and 0.680.0410 -3 mm 2 s for the controls. There was no significant difference in MD. The sizes of the tracts were 12.22.5 mm (7.2-14.4 mm) before dilation (real size of the tract), 17.13.9 mm (9-23.4 mm) after dilation, 13.1 3.1 mm (7.2-16.6 mm) after the first erosion, and 7.2 1.3 mm (5.4-9 mm) after the second erosion (core of the tract). The intraobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) for the first and second measurement was r0.93 for measured FA and r0.92 for measured MD. By the conventional method, the mean FA values were 0.35 0.015 for patients with AD and 0.380.025 for controls (P0.0001). All ten voxelized tracts of the UF were visually evaluated as grade 1 by the conventional method, whereas by the new method two voxelized tracts of the UF were evaluated as grade 1 and eight were evaluated as grade 0 (P0.0004, Fishers exact test).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Many studies have investigated white matter abnormalities in AD using DTI, including regions such as the hippocampus, temporal stem, posterior cingulate, and occipital and parietal white matter. A number of studies have demonstrated that FA is decreased in some patients 3, 6, 9, 13, 16-18, 22, 37. Our results support the findings of these previous studies. In the present study, we paid particular attention to diffusion abnormalities of the UF in AD and applied a new erosion method that enabled the core of the UF to be obtained for the first time.\nThe UF is a hook-like fiber bundle that can be divided into temporal, insular, and frontal segments 25,26. The frontal segment of the UF has a fan-like shape in the frontal orbital white matter and is oriented in a horizontal plane. The fibers of the UF connect the cortical nuclei of the amygdala and the uncus with the subcallosal region. The tips of the superior, medial, and inferior temporal gyri are connected, via the UF, with the gyrus rectus and medial and lateral orbital gyri as well as the orbital segment of the inferior frontal gyrus. The UF consists of both afferent and efferent fibers to both the temporal and frontal areas 26,38; it has a ventral part that connects the orbital cortex with the amygdala and hippocampal gyrus, and a dorsal section that connects the temporal pole cortex with the rostral end of the middle frontal gyrus 26,39,40.\nIn the present study, visualizing DTT enabled clear identification of the UF and more precise measurement of diffusion parameters by avoiding contamination of data from adjacent structures such as CSF or callosal fibers. Our method was relatively objective because voxelization along the core of the UF was performed using DTT, compared with a simple manually drawn ROI study in which ROIs can be set anywhere. Because the white matter tracts of interest were segmented by DTT and the portion of segmented tract was evaluated selectively, our methods may be more sensitive than methods that use other anatomical landmarks. The extracted core of the tract is smaller than the real size of the tract. If we erode the shape of a tract, there is a reduction of two or three voxels depending on the direction of the tract.\nTo the best of our knowledge, few previous studies have used color-coded maps 7,17, and only one previous study has used DTT 22 for DTI abnormalities in AD patients. Taoka et al. measured DTI abnormalities in the UF, inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and Meyers loop using DTT in AD patients and control subjects 22. Our study differs from that of Taoka et al. in core of the tract. The patient group in the study of Taoka et al. was in late AD, and there were differences in both FA and ADC of the UF; in contrast, we found differences only in FA of the UF in our study group. The results of the present study suggest that only change in FA of the UF may be significant in early-stage AD. It is unclear from their report 22 whether Taoka et al. used avoidance or not. The use of avoidance is time consuming and operatordependent. Our new method does not require the use of any avoidance. Taoka et al. used the threshold for line tracking termination of FA values 0.18 and measured the voxels along the line of the fiber tracts. On the other hand, we used the threshold for line tracking termination of FA values 0.15 and we measured the voxels along the whole fiber tracts.\nTakahashi et al. found that FA values were significantly lower in the temporal subcortical white matter, in the posterior part of the corpus callosum, and in the anterior and posterior cingulate fibers in patients with AD compared to controls 17. Bozzali et al. found that FA values were lower in the corpus callosum as well as in the white matter of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in patients with AD compared to controls 9. In contrast, Kantarci et al. found no differences in anisotropy index between AD patients and controls 4. We consider that this discrepancy is associated with the method of data acquisition and processing as well as the patient population.\nA limitation of the present study was the relatively small number of patients. Future studies should therefore include a greater number of patients.\nIn conclusion, TSA using an erosion technique to segment the core of the fiber appears to be a highly sensitive and practical method for assessing white matter changes in AD. Our results suggest that FA reflects progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the UF of white matter and may represent a useful biological index in monitoring AD.",

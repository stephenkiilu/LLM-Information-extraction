    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Many South African adolescents come from poor socioeconomic environments (Plessis et al. 2007) and are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay and lasting neurocognitive dysfunction by way of complex interactions between exogenous and biological factors (Jensen et al. 2017). Exogenous factors include poorer quality of education, lack of social support, greater exposure violence and psychological stressors, whereas biological factors include processes involved in neural growth, energy metabolism, inflammation, and neuroendocrine stress responses (Jensen et al. 2017). However, just how this complex interplay affects neurodevelopment and later functioning remains uncertain.\nEpigenetic processes function as an interface between an individuals environment and molecular biology. Epigenetic regulation is an important aspect of neurodevelopment and cell differentiation, by which biological changes can be elicited by environmental factors, thus making it a potential mechanism for understanding how early life environmental events and realities affect later neurobehavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes (Urdinguio et al. 2009;Rangasamy et al. 2013;Gapp et al. 2014;Roubroeks et al. 2017). Among known epigenetic processes, DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a particularly critical role in the neurobiology, from the development of the mammalian brain (Jaenisch and Bird 2003) to neurogenesis in adulthood (Simmons et al. 2013;Gapp et al. 2014). There is an ever growing account of the impact of early life events on DNAm; for example, specific DNAm changes have been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of psychiatric illness as a result of prenatal nutrition and exposure to teratogens, prenatal stress, maternal care, early traumatic experiences, and lack of environmental enrichment (Kofink et al. 2013;Turecki and Meaney 2016;Garg et al. 2018) (Gapp et al. 2014;Smigielski et al. 2020).\nBased on the established links between early environment and later neurologic and psychiatric outcomes via DNAm, as well as the capacity to now accurately measure DNAm on a genome-wide level, DNAm analysis among phenotypically well-characterized cohorts has potential for deepening our understanding of the neurodevelopmental and cognitive effects of early life adversity and environmental challenges. This has particular relevance among youth in low household income countries such as South Africa who are likely have a significant environmental component in their brain development and later cognitive functioning. Further, the utility of epigenetics extends beyond its explanatory power, as pharmaceutical interventions that could involve manipulation of epigenetic processes such as DNAm may be possible (Xu et al. 2012;Kane and Sinclair 2019).\nSeveral independent groups have demonstrated the potential value one particular type of DNAm biomarker termed epigenetic clocks for understanding how environment and disease affect biological aging. For example, applying an early epigenetic clock (Horvath et al. 2016), we and others have shown across numerous data sets that plasma HIV infection accelerates aging in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue (Levine et al. 2016;Horvath et al. 2018) and that this accelerated aging is associated with greater likelihood of cognitive dysfunction (Horvath et al. 2018). Our group has also recently demonstrated that age acceleration, as determined via an epigenetic clock, is associated with poorer cognitive functioning in South African adolescents living with HIV (Horvath et al. 2018). However, it remains unknown whether age acceleration is related to alterations in the development of brain structures in otherwise healthy young adolescents. In the current study, we aimed to apply pan tissue epigenetic clocks (Horvath 2013) to a cohort of South African young adolescents to investigate whether accelerated aging is associated with changes in cognitive function, brain macrostructure or white matter integrity. We hypothesised that accelerated aging according to one or more of the epigenetic clocks would be associated with altered neuro-developmental trajectories in adolescents, and that this will be detectable at the macro and microstructure levels of brain anatomy.",

      "text": "A cross-sectional analysis of enrollment data from a neurologic sub study of the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC), a longitudinal study of adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa was done. The CTAAC study aims to investigate markers of chronic disease processes and progression in five key areas (general adolescent development, neurocognitive function, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular function, and musculoskeletal disease) in perinatally HIV infected adolescents on ART and healthy adolescents (Hoare et al. 2018). The present study included only the healthy adolescents from this cohort. Routine care providers told all adolescentcaregiver dyads attending one of the 4 recruitment sites, who were in the target age range, about the study. Interested adolescentscaregivers were formally screened, and if eligible and willing to participate, provided with an appointment to attend an enrollment visit 1-2 weeks later at Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital. Adolescents were recruited primarily from primary care sector health care service from across Cape Town; inclusion criteria were aged 9-12 years. Exclusion criteria for the present study were: 1) HIV infection 2) an uncontrolled medical condition, such as diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, or tuberculosis (TB) requiring hospital admission; 3) an identified CNS condition, including meningitis (TB or bacterial), cerebrovascular accident, lymphoma, history of head injury with loss of consciousness greater than 5 minutes or any radiological evidence of skull fracture, history of perinatal complications including hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or neonatal jaundice requiring exchange transfusion, or neurodevelopmental disorder 4) no consent and assent obtainable.\nThe primary caregiver of each adolescent provided written informed consent prior to participation, and child assent was obtained. The study was approved by the University of Cape Towns Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of California Los Angeles Institutional Review Board. Data and samples were obtained from 44 healthy participants between 2013 and 2015. Baseline health and sociodemographic questionnaires were administered to obtain general health information, medical history, and data on ancestry. Pubertal development was measured using the Tanners scale (Micklesfield et al. 2014). Low level systemic inflammation was measured using high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) from blood draw.",

Caregiver depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) (Brenner and Penzenik 2017). Beck Youth Inventories (BYI) (Steer et al. 2016) was used to assess the adolescents experience of depression, anxiety, anger, disruptive behaviour, and self-concept (Hoare et al. 2019). Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (Louw et al. 2016) was used to assess child behavioural and emotional problems and psychopathology. The life events questionnaire (LEQ) (Roy and Perry 2004) focuses on stressful life events. A stress measure was created by combining CBCL Total Problems, LEQ, Parental depression (CESD) and BYI total score. Higher scores on both the CBCL and the BYI have been associated with stress in children in previous studies (Osika et al. 2007;Kieffer-Kristensen et al. 2011).",

Tests were administered in the childrens home language. Test instructions were translated and back-translated into isiXhosa, and test administration complied with International Test Commission guidelines (Muñiz et al. 2013). Where possible neurocognitive measures were adjusted for age by using age-adjusted scaled scores in the scoring of the tests. General intellectual functioning was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI: (Axelrod:2002)). The following tests were used to examine cognitive domains: Fingertip Tapping subtest from the NEPSY-II (Brooks et al. 2009). Grooved Pegboard Test (Bryden and Roy 2005). Subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV; (Wechsler 2003)) measured information processing speed, The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT (Watanabe et al. 2005), the Boston Naming Test -Short Form-South Africa (BNT-SF-SA (Roth 2011), category and phonemic fluency, immediate and delayed recall trials of the RCFT and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R: (Benedict et al. 1998), WISC-IV Digit Span backwards (DS backwards) subtest, the Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and the NEPSY-II Inhibition subtests.",

    "Cognitive domains": {
      "text": "Using data from the test battery, as well as theoretical knowledge about the construct(s) of each test; we created ten separate composite cognitive domains: general intellectual functioning, attention, working memory, visual memory, verbal memory, language, visual spatial ability, motor coordination, processing speed, and executive function. To determine the statistical strength of each cognitive domain, we conducted Cronbachs alpha on combinations of neuropsychological tests to determine which neuropsychological tests had strong inter-relatedness (or internal consistency) within a specific domain. For the Cronbachs alpha, we used the total scaled scores of the tests, andor subtests, for each of the individual neuropsychological tests. Scaled scores were used because they take into account the childs age and sex. To calculate the individual test scaled scores, the individual test publisher norms were used. Where test publisher norms were not available we converted the test raw score into a z-score. A Cronbachs alpha value of 0.7 was considered an indication of good inter-relatedness between the tests. The Cronbachs alpha were done for domains in which there were more than one neuropsychological test measuring performance within the domain. The domains of language and visual spatial ability, consisted of one test from the battery, and therefore Cronbachs alpha values were not reported for these domains. Tests which did not contribute well to the cognitive domains with regard to the Cronbachs alpha value were excluded from the individual composite cognitive domain scores. Composite cognitive domain scores were calculated by averaging the scores of the all tests that comprised each domain, giving a single score for each domain for individual participants (Phillips et al. 2018). We used the samples means and standard deviations to convert all scaled and T-scores of the individual neuropsychological tests into z-scores.",

    "Epigenetic Characterization": {
      "text": "Blood Collection and Processing-Blood samples were drawn at the enrollment visit. DNA was extracted from blood samples using the QIAsymphony DSP DNA Midi kit and protocol. DNA was quantified using BioDrop (Whitehead Scientific, South Africa) and normalized to a concentration of 5-10ngul. All samples were tracked using a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS; Freezerworks, USA).\nDNA Methylation-DNA methylation analysis was performed with the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip, which measures bisulfite-conversion-based, single-CpG resolution DNAm levels at 866,836 CpG sites in the human genome. The standard protocol of Illumina methylation assays quantifies methylation levels by the β value using the ratio of intensities between methylated (signal A) and un-methylated (signal B) alleles. Specifically, the β value is calculated from the intensity of the methylated (M corresponding to signal A) and un-methylated (U corresponding to signal B) alleles, as the ratio of fluorescent signals β  Max(M,0)Max(M,0)  Max(U,0)  100. Thus, β values range from 0 (completely unmethylated) to 1 (completely methylated) (Dunning et al. 2008). We used the noob normalization method (Triche et al. 2013), which is implemented in the minfi R package (Aryee et al. 2014).\nDNA methylation age and the epigenetic clock-Several highly accurate epigenetic biomarkers of chronological age have been proposed (Garagnani et al. 2012;Horvath 2013). These biomarkers use weighted averages of methylation levels at specific CpG sites to produce estimates of age (in units of years), referred to as DNA methylation age (DNAm age) or epigenetic age. Even after adjusting for chronological age, the DNAm age of blood has been found to be associated with the risk for all-cause mortality (Christiansen et al. 2015;Perna et al. 2016), frailty, (Breitling et al. 2016) and cognitive functioning (Chouliaras et al. 2018). We employed two different epigenetic age estimators. First, we used the pan tissue DNAm age estimator (Horvath 2013), which is defined as a prediction method of age based on the DNAm levels of 353 CpGs. Second, we applied the Hannum measure of DNAm age based on 71 CpGs, which was developed using DNA methylation data from blood (Armstrong et al. 2017) (Horvath et al. 2016).\nThe EEAA measure has exhibited the strongest predictive association with all-cause mortality and it revealed the strongest association with cognitive functioning measures in our previous study (Horvath et al. 2018). AAR is less confounded by changes in blood cell composition, applies to all tissue samples, is particularly accurate in adolescents (Horvath 2013;Levine et al. 2016). While AAR is relatively robust with respect to changes in blood cell composition, EEAA capitalizes on age related changes in blood cell types and captures aspects of immunosenescence (Chen et al. 2016).\nThe epigenetic clock method and software applies to data generated using any Illumina platform (including the EPIC array). Missing CpG probes were automatically imputed by the software. Mathematical details and software tutorials for the epigenetic clock can be found in the Additional files of (Horvath 2013). An online age calculator can be found at our webpage: http:labs.genetics.ucla.eduhorvathdnamage.",

A single-channel transmit-receive head coil was used with the following parameters: TR  8800ms, TE  88ms, field-of-view of 220mm, 1.8  1.8  2.0 mm 3 image resolution, 65 slices, 0 distance factor and 2x GRAPPA acceleration. Images were acquired in an axial orientation with 30 gradient directions at b  1000mms 2 , and 3 directions with b  0mms 2 . The acquisition was repeated 3 times to allow for redundancy in data. A multi-echo MPRAGE T1-weighted image was acquired with the following parameters: FOV  256  256mm, TR  2530ms, TE  1.533.214.896.57ms, TI  1100ms, flip angle  7, 144 slices, in-plane resolution  1.3  1.0mm 2 and slice thickness of 1.0mm. DTI Preprocessing-Diffusion weighted images were corrected for eddy current distortion within FSL 5.0.1 and imported into MATLAB R2013b for processing. This entailed the affine registration to the average b 0mms 2 image of the first acquisition. For each of the acquisitions, outlier data points were determined by calculating the Z-values at the 25 th and 75 th percentile of the registered diffusion image. Any data points that were 3 SD from the mean were excluded. The corrected images were exported to FSL 5.0.1 after correction. In FSL 5.0.1 images underwent BET to remove any non-brain tissue and fit a linear tensor model to produce fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) maps.\nFractional anisotropy images were analysed with the TBSS pipeline (Smith et al. 2006). Each participants FA was registered to a study-specific target. This target was determined by registering each participant to every other participant. The mean square displacement coefficient of each image was calculated and the participant with the lowest mean displacement was chosen as a representative target for the group. After registration to the study-specific target, each image was then up-sampled to MNI space, taking into account the previous transformation parameters. An average FA was created and thinned to produce a mean FA skeleton with a threshold of 0.2. This skeleton is representative of the centres of white matter tracts common to the group. Registration and skeleton projection were also applied to the MD, images as described above.\nFreesurfer preprocessing-T1-weighted images were processed with Freesurfer V5.3 on the Lengau cluster at the Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC), Rosebank, Cape Town, South Africa. The pipeline has been described previously (Fischl et al. 2001). T1-weighted images were normalized, bias-field corrected and skull-stripped. Inner and outer cortical surfaces were modeled as triangular tessellation. Cortical thickness measurements were obtained by calculating the distance (in mm) between pial and greywhite matter surfaces at each vertex location (Fischl and Dale 2000). Cortical surface area was calculated as the average of the grey matter vertices over regions. The vertex data was normalized to the fsaverage template included with Freesurfer by utilizing a curvature matching technique (Fischl et al. 2002). For volumetric data, the brain was segmented into volume-based labels utilizing probabilistic methods (Fischl et al. 2001). After reconstruction, each individual scan was checked for any major errors in segmentation, corrected and rerun if needed.",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "Bivariate Pearson correlation tests were run between the two epigenetic aging measures and 10 cognitive functioning domains, to assess for differences in cognitive performance as epigenetic aging increases. To assess the roles of epigenetic age acceleration on brain structure, we developed backward elimination stepwise multiple regression models in R (version 3.4.3, 2017) covering cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and volume, as well as DTI (FA, MD, RD, and AD) values. Each brain measure was modelled as a dependent variable of a multivariable regression model. The backward feature elimination procedure started out with the full regression model that included all predictors (including chronological age, sex, and epigenetic age acceleration). This was done in order to assess which variables were most associated with brain structural values, leaving only those variables in the model that contributed to the anatomical variance. EEAA and AAR were tested separately to avoid multi-collinearity in the regression models.\nIn each case, sex, chronological age, and AAR or EEAA were modelled as predictor variables with the value of the regional brain characteristic (i.e. thickness, surface area, volume, FA, or MD) as the dependent (outcome) variable. Each brain region and characteristic led to a separate regression model. Given the stepwise approach (backward feature elimination) taken in the multiple regression analyses, all predictors that had a predictive value of p0.15 were left in the model and thus contribute to the final R2 value, however, only those that had significant predictive value (nominal p0.05) are in bold typeface in the results tables (Tables 2 and3). The inclusion of each predictor variable is indicated by its beta value in the relevant column of the results tables. The R2 values indicate the percentage of the brain characteristic variance explained by each model.\nStepwise general linear models were created to assess effects of pubertal development, hs-CRP, and stress on epigenetic aging measures. Level of pubertal development was also compared between boys and girls.",

It was also associated with microstructural alterations in RD, MD, and AD values across much white matter, including the internal capsule, fornix, longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. (Table 2).\nEEAA was also associated with many regional structural changes across the brain. Increased EEAA is associated with reduced cortical thickness in the parietal -temporal nexus, as well as medial areas such as the pericalcarine, and fusiform gyri. Surface area across the whole brain was affected negatively by EEAA, while volume in primarily subcortical regions was negatively affected. FA was also negatively affected by EEA, and MD and RD were increased in multiple white matter regions (Table 3).\nSex was positively associated with cortical surface area and FA across a number of brain regions indicating a higher value in females, while MD and RD white matter inflammation markers were lower in females. ( see Figure 2) The epigenetic aging markers (AAR and EEAA) contributed more to the brain structural values than biological age, particularly EEAA as a negative contributor of volume, surface area, and cortical thickness, and FA. Overall, EEAA was associated with more alterations in both grey and white matter values than AAR. See Table 2 for full results of AAR and Table 3 for full results of the EEAA models.\nCombined Stress score, Tanner score, and hs-CRP were included as predictors in a multiple regression model to predict epigenetic aging, separately for AAR and EEAA.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This is the first study to show that epigenetic age acceleration in young adolescents from low income households is associated with alterations in brain morphology and poorer visual memory and visual spatial acuity. Specifically, epigenetic age acceleration (AAR) (Horvath 2013) and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) were associated with regional decreases in cortical thickness and cortical surface area as well as subcortical grey matter volumes. In addition, white matter microstructural integrity of the internal capsule, superior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi, and other regions were associated with AAR and EEAA. The epigenetic aging markers (AAR and EEAA) contributed more to the brain structural values than chronological age, particularly EEAA as a negative contributor of volume, surface area, and cortical thickness, and FA. Finally, Stress was a significant predictor of AAR.\nLimited research is available on the interaction of epigenetic age and brain macro and microstructure in children or adolescents. Gene expression is regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, for example DNAm, which acts at the interface between environmental stimuli and molecular, cellular and behavioural phenotypes acquired during periods of high developmental plasticity (Fagiolini et al. 2009). Early supportive parenting has a positive effect on the development of a healthy hippocampus, a brain structure important to memory and stress modulation, as previously documented in school children (Luby et al. 2012). Adolescents who grow up in poor socioeconomic conditions could have higher baseline glucocorticoid levels, in addition to adolescents whose caregivers were depressed in the early postnatal period (Lupien et al. 2009). In the current study of young adolescents from low-income households, stress was a significant predictor of AAR. Alterations in grey matter volume and the white matter integrity of the frontal cortex, in addition to reduced volume of the anterior cingulate cortex, has been reported in adolescents exposed to early life adversity (Cohen et al. 2006). The relevance of these findings is underscored by our recent findings adolescents living with HIV, that EEAA remained negatively associated with executive functioning, working memory and processing speed in our cohort, after adjusting for educational level, ethnicity, and household income (Horvath et al. 2018). Thus, accelerated aging and the resulting gradual neurological changes have as their endpoint measurable neurocognitive deficits, which translate into poorer scholastic functioning. One would perhaps not expect DNAm age of blood to be associated with measures of cognitive functioning this early in adolescent neurodevelopment (Horvath et al. 2018). However, the developmental consequences of childhood poverty are well documented (Jensen et al. 2017). A multitude of risk factors are associated with poverty and could have a negative impact on adolescent development. Risks factors that are likely to play a significant role in the adverse developmental effects of poverty include, infectious disease, food insecurity and stressors related to the rearing environment (Jensen et al. 2017). Understanding the contributing factors to cognitive impairment is important, as minor impairments may progress to more significant complications that will influence future functional performance, job opportunities, and community participation of South African youth (Horvath et al. 2018). Importantly, our findings provide further evidence that blood is a potential surrogate for brain tissue when studying neurocognitive impairment (Horvath 2013).\nSeveral limitations of this study should be emphasized. First, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences and the study number is small. Longitudinal follow-up is underway to better understand the impact of epigenetic age acceleration on brain structure and functioning in later adolescence. Although congenital infections and incidental CNS abnormalities were excluded as far as possible on history, clinical examination and on clinical review of the MRI scans, it remains a possibility that there may be some overlapping effects of undiagnosed conditions. Future research should focus on delineating specific factors that may account for accelerated aging in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a cause of stroke and dementia. Retinal capillary microvessels revealed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) are developmentally related to brain microvessels. We quantified retinal vessel density (VD) and branching complexity, investigating relationships with SVD lesions, white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to CO 2 in patients with minor stroke. We enrolled 123 patients (mean age 68.1 AE SD 9.9 years), 115 contributed retinal data. Right (R) and left (L) eyes are reported. After adjusting for age, eye disease, diabetes, blood pressure and image quality, lower VD remained associated with higher mean diffusivity (MD) (standardized b; R À0.16 95CI À0.32 to À0.01) and lower CVR (L 0.17 0.03 to 0.31 and R 0.19 0.02 to 0.36) in normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Sparser branching remained associated with sub-visible white matter damage shown by higher MD (R À0.24 À0.08 to À0.40), lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (L 0.17 0.01 to 0.33), and lower CVR (R 0.20 0.02 to 0.38) in NAWM. OCTA-derived metrics provide evidence of microvessel abnormalities that may underpin SVD lesions in the brain.",

      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major cause of stroke and dementia yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear and treatments are limited. SVD pathophysiology is mainly thought to occur at the level of brain perforating microvessels and includes impaired vasodilation, subtle blood-brain barrier leakage and perivascular tissue damage, 1 and vessel stiffening which could together impair glymphatic drainage. 2,3 Common structural brain imaging features of SVD include white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and perivascular spaces (PVS). 4 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods like blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) imaging with hypercapnic stimulus 5 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 6 can identify vascular dysfunction and white matter damage, respectively, in brain tissue.\nBlood vessels in the retina share many features with similarly sized vessels in the brain, including their embryological origin and anatomic and physiological characteristics. 7 By examining the condition of the retinas microvascular system that is captured on noninvasive imaging, from the main arcades (40 lm in diameter) observed on fundus photography, to the capillaries (down to 8 lm) seen with newer technologies such as optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), 8 we might draw useful conclusions about the brains microvascular health. OCTA might even be able to detect early microvascular changes before sequela are visible with brain imaging modalities.\nPrevious investigations with fundus photography have shown that patients with small vessel (lacunar) stroke have wider venules, 9 smaller arterioles 10 and decreased fractal dimension of the vessel branching pattern, suggesting a sub-optimal microvascular network compared with other ischemic stroke subtypes. 11 Moreover, retinal microvascular abnormalities (such as focal arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking) observed on fundus imaging are associated with incident lacunar stroke during follow-up, 12 and retinopathy (such as microaneurysms, haemorrhages and exudates) is associated with dementia 13 and stroke. 14 Markers of SVD in the brain have also been shown to associate with findings from fundus imaging. These include an increase in PVS volume associated with decreasing fractal dimension 15 and increased retinal vessel branching coefficients with periventricular WMH. 16 OCTA is a relatively recent advance in retinal imaging which visualizes retinal capillaries, and is described as having near histology level resolution 8 (see Kashani et al. 8 for its application in eye disease). In neurological disease, a recent systematic review 17 found changes on OCTA in the foveal avascular zone, perfusion density and vessel density (VD) in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and pre-symptomatic AD but sparse data precluded conclusion about OCTA findings in SVD and whether decreased VD was associated with worse WMH. There was no information on other SVD features such as PVS and few studies accounted for covariates. Therefore, whether and how OCTA imaging features relate to brain imaging features in sporadic SVD remains unclear.\nHere, we investigated associations between retinal microvascular parameters measured using OCTA and SVD markers from brain MRI including visible SVD lesions, blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, and DTI measurements of white matter microstructural integrity in patients with SVD who presented with a minor stroke.",

The outputs from both methods were combined to generate the final binary map that contained vessels where both threshold images agreed.

    "Quality of OCTA images": {

The manufacturers OCTA quality index, Q, being the average signal strength measured in decibels for all structural B-scans in the image volume, was recorded for each eye. B-scans of Q  20 are rejected during acquisition, thus the averaged Q has a lower bound of 20. Healthy eyes with no media opacities can achieve Q values of around 40 or higher, thus Q tends to range from 20 to 40. Heidelberg Engineering suggests good OCTA enface images are obtained with Q  ¼ 28.\nQ does not always correlate well with image quality as perceived by a human rater. Important factors not captured in Q include focus and residual eye motion. Thus, two trained raters (S.J.W. and J.F.Z.) visually graded the interpretability of all OCTA images independently on an ordinal scale with 5 categories (1 ¼ Inadequate, 2 ¼ Poor, 3 ¼ Average, 4 ¼ Good and 5 ¼ Excellent) (examples given in Supplementary Figure 1), and disagreements were resolved by discussion.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study demonstrates that lower retinal VD on OCTA is associated with higher MD and lower CVR magnitude in NAWM, consistent with a reduction in small vessel density in the brain underpinning the observed impairments in vascular function and subvisible white matter structure seen with increasing SVD lesion burden. We also observed lower branching complexity (fractal dimension) with lower CVR magnitude, and with sub-visible white matter damage suggested by higher MD and lower FA in NAWM.\nCVR estimates the adequacy of the change in blood flow in response to a vasoactive stimulus, and is impaired in SVD particularly in affected tissues. 29 CVR magnitude in white matter is lower in patients with more severe SVD features, 28 and CVR delay is longer in SVD patients than healthy controls. 5,37,38 Here, we found that lower retinal VD on OCTA was associated with lower CVR magnitude in NAWM after correcting for a range of key covariates, also validating the results of a much smaller (N ¼ 11) study of older subjects. 39 Lower branching complexity related to lower CVR and higher MD in NAWM.\nIncreased MD occurs in WMH and also in NAWM as the severity of SVD lesions increase and indicates sub-visible alterations in white matter integrity. 40 No prior studies investigated the relationship between OCTA parameters and DTI measures of white matter structural integrity in SVD. Here, we found that lower retinal VD on OCTA was associated with increased MD in NAWM, consistent with vessel density decreasing in NAWM as the SVD burden worsens. Here, reduced branching complexity also related to more sub-visible white matter damage (higher MD and lower FA in NAWM) in keeping with increased interstitial fluid content and mobility, demyelination, and axonal loss. It will be important to assess whether early retinal vascular changes can predict WMH progression and white matter damage in the long term. PVS in the brain are a marker of vascular dysfunction, amongst several associations, and occur early in development of SVD. 41 We have previously demonstrated a link between increasing PVS volumes and decreasing fractal dimension of larger retinal arterioles on fundus photography, 15 as did a previous study of PVS in the CSO. 42 Here, there were strong univariate associations between both lower VD and less complex branching and more PVS (computational volumes and counts but not visual ratings), but none survived adjustment for covariates. The typical vessel arborization pattern of the retina is thought to be in accordance with Murrays Law of Minimal Work, which strives for less energy dissipation and maximum efficiency of energy use when transporting blood. 43 Reduction from the optimized vessel branching to sparser patterns may link to SVD lesions through impaired small vessel function (as reflected in impaired CVR) and less efficient energy management.\nWMH are a common feature of cerebral SVD on brain MRI. Previous retinal OCTA studies used Fazekas score to represent WMH severity, with inconsistent findings. 17,39,44,45 In a wide range of study populations including AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), SVD or cognitively normal adults, some studies 17,39,44 observed that decreased VD on OCTA was associated with increased Fazekas score, while others 17,45 showed no significant association which might partly be due to small sample size. 17 Here, worse WMH (computationally and by visual score) strongly related to reduced VD and reduced branching on univariate analyses (Supplementary Figure S2) but effects were lost in fully adjusted analyses.\nIn our study, we did not find an association between OCTA measures and resting arterial blood flow, possibly suggesting retinalcentral perfusion stability. In a small study (35 eyes from 18 patients) of pre-and postoperative major non-neurological surgery requiring planned intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, 46 retinal blood flow was stable and the authors conclude that the stability of retinal blood flow measures suggests the potential for OCTA to provide clinically useful measures in ITU patients. OCTA could be used as a potential biomarker of central perfusion in SVD but more data is needed. In a recent updated meta-analysis, 47 WMH were found to associate with reduced cerebral blood flow cross-sectionally but when studies of patients with dementia or that failed to account for vascular risk factors were excluded, the relationship disappeared. Longitudinal associations between blood flow and SVD burden are mixed and remain unclear. 47 The strengths of this study are the relatively large sample of patients with a confirmed stroke, analyses of both eyes per participant, a comprehensive brain imaging protocol that generated key brain imaging metrics describing SVD, and adjustment for vascular risk factors and OCTA image quality. We also acknowledge weaknesses. The cross-sectional design precludes inferences on the temporal link between impaired retinal microvasculature and SVD progression but MSS-3 is gathering the data to address retinal and brain changes in SVD. We did not assess retinal vessels from the deep vascular layers. There are no data in our study representing a non-stroke control group, rather, we are interested in within-group associations between the eye and brain to help deepen our understanding of small vessel dysfunction.\nIn conclusion, our study showed that impaired retinal capillary-level changes identified using OCTA were associated with structural SVD markers and impaired cerebral vasoreactivity. OCTA measures hold promise as non-invasive biomarkers of cerebral SVD, being relatively easy to tolerate and economical. Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the predictive power of OCTA measurements for SVD progression and monitor treatment responses.",

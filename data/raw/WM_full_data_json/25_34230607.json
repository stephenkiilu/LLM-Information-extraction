    "abstract": "Loneliness is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Deeper understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying loneliness is needed to identify potential intervention targets. We did not find any systematic review of neurobiology of loneliness. Using MEDLINE and PsycINFO online databases, we conducted a search for peer-reviewed publications examining loneliness and neurobiology. We identified 41 studies (n  16,771 participants) that had employed various methods including computer tomography (CT), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and postmortem brain tissue RNA analysis or pathological analysis. Our synthesis of the published findings shows abnormal structure (gray matter volume or white matter integrity) andor activity (response to pleasant versus stressful images in social versus nonsocial contexts) in the prefrontal cortex (especially medial and dorsolateral), insula (particularly anterior), amygdala, hippocampus, and posterior superior temporal cortex. The findings related to ventral striatum and cerebellum were mixed. fMRI studies reported links between loneliness and differential activation of attentional networks, visual networks, and default mode network. Loneliness was also related to biological markers associated with Alzheimers disease (e.g., amyloid and tau burden). Although the published investigations have limitations, this review suggests relationships of loneliness with altered structure and function in specific brain regions and networks. We found a notable overlap in the regions involved in loneliness and compassion, the two personality traits that are inversely correlated in previous studies. We have offered recommendations for future research studies of neurobiology of loneliness.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Loneliness is a critical determinant of well-being and also a grand challenge to society 1,2. Defined as distress due to perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social relationships, loneliness is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disorders 3, dementia 4, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation 5,6, and 30 greater mortality 789. Loneliness is distinct from objective social isolation or the lack of social relationshipscontacts. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently published a report on social isolation and loneliness among older adults, calling for more research of neurobiology and interventions 2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, loneliness, which has been linked to physical distancing measures, is a growing concern for all age groups across the world.\nHumans are a social species and have ingrained neural, hormonal, and genetic mechanisms to help navigate social connections. Absence of quality relationships threatens health and reproduction 10. Cacioppo et al. posited loneliness evolved to improve survivability when socially isolated, through hypervigilance and increasing motivation to connect with others 10. Animal models of social isolation have demonstrated alterations in neurotransmitters, receptor sensitivities, and levels of certain biomarkers 10,11. Few studies have examined the impact of social isolation on specific brain regions 111213. Furthermore, the subjective nature of loneliness as well as inter-species differences in social functioning and brain structure limit the applicability of the animal studies to the uniquely human state of loneliness 11.\nOur recent investigations have found a strong and consistent inverse correlation between the personality traits of loneliness and wisdom, especially the empathycompassion component of wisdom 14151617. In contrast to loneliness, wisdom is associated with better mental and physical health 181920. The prefrontal cortex and limbic striatum reportedly play a major role in the neurobiology of empathycompassion and wisdom 21. Identifying neurobiological mechanisms underlying loneliness is critical for understanding how loneliness contributes to poor mental and physical health and for conceptualizing potential pharmacological and neurostimulation targets. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to identify and synthesize published brainbased findings linked to loneliness.",

    "Search strategy": {
      "text": "We conducted a literature search for peer-reviewed publications examining loneliness and neurobiology, outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram (Fig. 1). We surveyed MEDLINE and PsycINFO online databases on September 24, 2020, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) use of a validated scale for assessing loneliness and a measure of neurobiology, (2) published in English, (3) minimum of 10 human participants, and (4) statistical analysis examining the relationship of loneliness and neurobiology. We excluded animal studies and literature reviews.\nWe defined validated measures of loneliness as scales or questions that measured feeling lonely, socially isolated, or disconnected. The most commonly used scale was the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS 15,17,22), although we also included validated, briefer multiple-or single-item questions 23. Neurobiology measures included assessments of brain structure or function: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or electroencephalography (EEG). We also included brain pathology studies and genetic investigations that extracted genetic materials from brain regions. We did not include studies with only cognitive measures or studies using cortisol or other peripheral biomarkers from blood or other tissues outside the brain. The specific search strategy is outlined in Supplementary Appendix A.\nThe search yielded 305 articles of interest. After removing duplicates and adding potentially relevant papers from bibliographies of the articles selected, each study title and abstract was screened for eligibility by at least two authors (JAL, ERM, KEY, MR). Articles with any uncertainties were discussed and resolved among all authors. Data from each of the final batch of 41 studies selected (Fig. 1) were extracted by the primary author and checked by at least one other coauthor. Sample sizes ranged from 19 to 10,129. Most of the studies (61) included fewer than 100 individuals, 38 with 100-942 individuals, and one study with over 10,000 individuals.\nTo assess the quality of the studies, we used the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies and cohort studies and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies (Supplementary Table 2).",

      "text": "Twenty-four studies focused on younger adults (mean age 18-60; ), 12 on older adults (mean age 60; 484950515253545556575859), two on adolescents 60,61, and two across the lifespan 62,63. Most reports included healthy individuals while seven focused on clinical populations: four with depression 47,49,51,57, and one each with traumatic brain injury (TBI) 58, schizophrenia 28, and severe hearing impairment 27. Eighteen studies came from the US, 13 from China, three each from Germany and Taiwan, and two from the UK, and one each from Japan and the Netherlands. Of the 41 studies, 5 (12.2) had hypothesis-driven analyses (e.g., region of interest focused), 21 (51.2) had exploratory analyses (e.g., whole brain analyses), 10 (24.4) had both, with 5 studies not fitting into any of the above categories.\nFifteen studies analyzed the relationship between loneliness and brain structures using CT 58 or MRI. Twelve were crosssectional, with eight focusing on gray matter volume, 26,31,35,36,46,57,59,63, and four on white matter features, employing DTI or diffusion MRI 29,32,38,61. The three longitudinal investigations included a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of effects of exercise on gray matter volume 54, a Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram for this systematic review that details the database searches, number of abstracts screened, and full-text articles evaluated for this literature review.\nprospective cohort study of progression of white matter hyperintensities 53, and a study of TBIs localized to different brain areas 58. These study findings are summarized in Table 1.\nEighteen reports analyzed the relationship between loneliness and brain function or connectivity using fMRI. Ten of these studies were task-based (n  10; 24,25,28,34,44,45,51,60,62,63), and two were resting-state fMRI (n  8; 37, 39-43, 47, 49) (Table 2). One report appears in both Tables 1 and2 63 Three investigations used EEG to examine high-density eventrelated potentials (ERPs) during different tasks 30,33,64, two analyzed RNA expression of post-mortem brain tissue 52,55, two employed PET to analyze amyloid and tau proteins 50,56, one longitudinal cohort study examined the association between postmortem brain tissue and Alzheimers disease 48, and one used SPECT to analyze dopamine release in the brain 27 (Table 3).\nThe quality of the included cross-sectional studies varied primarily on detailed descriptions of the study sample and setting, identification of confounding factors, and use of appropriate statistical strategies for confounders (Supplementary Table 2). The quality of cohort studies varied primarily on representative case sampling and controlling for confounders. There was only one identified cohort study.",

    "Brain regions": {
      "text": "Supplementary Table 2 lists publications sorted by brain regions studied.\nPrefrontal cortex or PFC (N  14 studies). Two articles focused on overall PFC. In one, male veterans with TBI to the right PFC had lower levels of loneliness compared to healthy controls 58. An RCT examining effects of exercise on loneliness in older adults found a greater reduction in stress and loneliness in participants with a larger baseline PFC volume, although PFC volume did not change over the 6-month intervention 54.\nIn seven studies of medial PFC (mPFC), loneliness was associated with greater mPFC activation in task-based fMRI during a social exclusion paradigm 24, less similarity between selfrepresentation and other-representation in mPFC activation 44, lower dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) white matter density 32, lower left dmPFC response when looking at pleasant social images and greater left dmPFC response when examining nonsocial images 25, increased functional connectivity between dmPFC and inferior parietal cortex during a working memory task 45, reduced vmPFC activation when looking at images of themselves 60, and nonsignificantly greater gray matter volumetric deviations of the vmPFC in females compared to males 46.\nIn five reports on dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), loneliness was associated with increased gray matter in left dlPFC 31, partially mediated the negative association between gray matter volume in left dlPFC and attitudes toward suicide 35, and was associated with lower gray matter volume in dlPFC, especially in subjects aged 69-82 compared to those 61-69 years old and in individuals with depression compared to nondepressed subjects 59. A resting-state fMRI study found the dlPFC as a node in the predictive model of loneliness 41. Another dlPFC RNA study is discussed below 55.\nInsula (N  6). Investigators reported an association of loneliness with a lesion in the right insula 58, lower gray matter volume, which was even lower in individuals with depression 59, lower regional white matter density in anterior insula 32, and poorer white matter tract connectivity with the nodes in ventral attentional network 29. fMRI paradigms showed that among lonely individuals, activation of insula (especially anterior insula) was greater among adults looking at pleasant social (than pleasant nonsocial) images, while ventral striatum activation was greater among non-lonely individuals 25. Among persons with schizophrenia, insula responsiveness was positively correlated with levels of loneliness, while overall insula activation with faces expressing disgust was decreased 28.\nAmygdala (N  6). One investigation reported a positive correlation between left amygdala gray matter volume and social distress score, which was mediated by loneliness 36. Another found that loneliness was associated with lower gray matter volume in left amygdala, especially in subjects aged 61-70 (compared to ages 70-82) 59. In an RCT of group exercise to improve loneliness among older adults, participants with larger baseline amygdala volumes experienced greater reductions in loneliness 54. Kiesow et al. found nonsignificantly greater gray matter volumetric deviations of amygdala between lonely and non-lonely males compared to females. 46. An fMRI region of interest (ROI) analysis failed to find significant differences in amygdala response to social stimuli in young or old adults 62, while another fMRI study found loneliness was associated with a weaker amygdala to superior frontal gyrus connectivity 51.\nVentral striatumnucleus accumbens (N  5). Studies of ventral striatum response to images with task-based fMRI paradigms among lonely individuals (vs. non-lonely individuals) reported different results: reduced response to pleasant social (compared to pleasant nonsocial) images 25; greater response to images of close others (compared to strangers) 34; and no significant differences in response to pleasant and non-pleasant social and nonsocial images 62. One report on association of loneliness with gray matter volume in left striatum among older adults with latelife depression found a positive correlation in single depressive episode individuals and negative association in multiple depressive episode individuals 57. Another nucleus accumbens RNA study is discussed below 52.\nPosterior superior temporal cortex (N  4). We defined this region as including both posterior superior sulcus (temporal-parietal junction or TPJ) and the region immediately below it, superior temporal gyrus. Studies reported an association of loneliness with lower white matter regional density 32, less gray matter volume in left posterior superior sulcus 26, lower structural local efficiency in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus 61, and lower bilateral superior temporal gyrus response when looking at unpleasant social images and greater response when looking at unpleasant nonsocial images 25.\nHippocampus (N  3). Investigators reported an association of loneliness with reduced anterior hippocampus gray matter volume, especially in older adults 59, lower white matter local structural efficiency (i.e., shorter weighted paths between local nodes) 61, and greater hippocampal response during a social exclusion task 24.\nCerebellum (N  3). One study reported that loneliness was associated with lower left cerebellar gray matter volume 59; however, another report found no main effects of loneliness on cerebellar ROIs 63. Loneliness was associated with higher connectivity between cerebellum and visual cortex during an fMRI Stroop task using positive words 63, and lower local structural efficiency in the white matter of the posterior cerebellum on structural MRI 61.",

    "Networks": {
      "text": "Visual systems (N  5). Investigators demonstrated that loneliness was associated with increased activation of left primary visual cortex and right secondary visual cortex when presented with unpleasant social (compared to unpleasant nonsocial) images 25, differences in the connection of visual network (fusiform gyrus, calcarine fissure, lingual gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, cuneus, superior occipital gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus) to other networks, with decreased causal flow from affective to visual networks 39, and greater right visual cortex functional connectivity to posterior cerebellum when presented positive words in task-based fMRI 63. Examining sex differences, the volume of visual sensory network (comprised of fusiform gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and middle temporal V5 area) deviated between lonely and non-lonely women but not men 46.\nAttentional systems (N  4). Investigations reported an association of loneliness with poorer connectivity of white matter tracts between the nodes of ventral attentional network 29 as well as differential activation of TPJ, a node in ventral attentional network. Loneliness was also linked to a weaker relationship between dorsal and ventral attentional networks indicating decreased ability to filter less relevant stimuli 39, as well as increased functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cinguloopercular network 37.\nDefault mode network (DMN) (N  3). One study found that higher social dysfunction (defined by loneliness, higher social disability, and smaller social network) was associated with decreased DMN connectivity, specifically in anterior mPFC and posterior superior frontal gyrus 47, while another report showed that loneliness was associated with reduced DMN functional connectivity in older healthy individuals compared to those with late-life depression 51. Using network analyses, one study found that among lonely individuals, overall resting-state network structures had increased integration (lower modularity) between attentional, visual, and default mode networks 43.\nOther studies Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology (N  4). A prospective longitudinal study demonstrated that increases in loneliness were correlated with increases in white matter hyperintensities among non-demented older adults 53. Two cross-sectional studies using PET imaging found a significant relationship between loneliness and higher amyloid burden, especially in APOEε4 carriers 50,56, and greater tau pathology in right entorhinal cortex and right fusiform gyrus 56). Another cohort study reported that the risk of the development of AD was significantly higher in lonely (than non-lonely) individuals; however, global AD pathology (β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, or cerebral infarction) in postmortem brains (n  90) showed no significant relationship to loneliness 48.\nEEG (N  3). In two separate publications using a Stroop task, loneliness was associated with faster ERPs with negative social (compared to negative nonsocial) words and threatening social (compared to threatening nonsocial) images 30,33. However, another report found no significant main effect of loneliness on error-related negativity (a component of ERP) when writing about a nostalgic event versus an ordinary experience 64.\nBrain RNA expression (N  2). Two studies of RNA expression in post-mortem brain tissue in nucleus accumbens and dlPFC 52,55 identified hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts and genes among lonely compared to non-lonely individuals, especially genes associated with AD 52,55. The relationships between loneliness and white matter structures were significantly different between BDNF genotypes 38.\nOther investigations (N  3). One investigation reported loneliness was explained equally well by whole brain static and dynamic functional connectivity, in contrast to traits like cognitive functioning, which were explained better by dynamic connectivity 42. Another study found loneliness was linked to altered brain activity in right inferior temporal gyrus on MRI and that the neural activity mediated the relationship between loneliness and emotional support 40. A longitudinal study reported that individuals with severe hearing impairment were lonelier and had a hypersensitive dopamine system in a SPECT scan pre-and post-amphetamine challenge, compared to people without hearing impairment 27.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systemic review of neurobiology of loneliness. The 41 publications meeting our criteria show that, despite some mixed evidence, loneliness is associated with structural and functional differences in PFC, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and posterior superior temporal cortex (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1), as well as attentional and visual networks and DMN. Drawing overall conclusions from this review is limited by the high heterogeneity of study methodologies and cohorts.\nWhile there is no literature on loneliness in non-human animals, neurobiological correlates of social isolation have been examined in several animal studies and a few human studies. There are a few reviews focused on integrating animal social isolation and human research 111213. However, the social isolation literature in animal models focus more on changes in endocrinology, neurotransmitters, and oxidative stress, rather than neuroanatomical or functional brain differences 11. These differing methodologies and paradigms make direct comparison challenging, though there are likely overlapping risk and protective factors for social isolation and loneliness.\nThe PFC mediates higher-order behaviors like emotional regulation and inhibitory control 65,66. The dlPFC is implicated in working memory and executive function 67, and mPFC is implicated in self-referential processes such as self-criticism in social situations 68. All 14 imaging studies examining PFC found associations of loneliness with structural (gray matter volume and white matter integrity) or functional components (activation with social vs. nonsocial images, and functional connectivity). These results are consistent with a previous review of animal studies of social isolation implicating PFC 13, and support loneliness as a complex socioemotional trait.\nThe insula somatic marker hypothesis states that insula receives and integrates information to create a global emotional moment 69. Anterior insula plays a role in various behaviors including emotions, pain, and self-awareness 70. In studies of gray matter, white matter connectivity, task-based activation, insula was reportedly associated with loneliness 25,28,29,32,58,59. It has been proposed that social rejection activates similar regions as physical pain, as supported by bilateral anterior insula activation with feelings of loneliness 70,71, although a more recent social rejection meta-analysis of fMRI studies did not find anterior insula involvement 72.\nThe amygdala is implicated in fear detection, positive stimuli processing, and emotional memories 73. Four studies of amygdala reported some association between gray matter volume or task-based activation and loneliness, with possible age-and sex-interactions 36,46,54,59. These findings are consistent with loneliness activating brain regions that support experiencing emotions. However, an fMRI study found no relationship with amygdala response to social stimuli 62.\nThe ventral striatum, which includes nucleus accumbens, plays a central role in reward reinforcement 74. Three studies of ventral striatum response to social images produced divergent results 25,34,62. A recently published fMRI study (published past our cutoff date) reported similar activation in substantia nigra ventral tegmental area (SNVTA) among young adults undergoing either 10 h of social isolation or fasting from food 75, supporting loneliness as a state that motivates one to seek social interaction, much like hunger motivates one to seek food. Interestingly, lonely participants had less activation in the SNVTA. Research based on social isolation in rodent models and social rejection in human experiments indicates that social isolation may alter social approach motivation 13, consistent with the findings that loneliness differentially alters ventral striatum and structures related to reward pathway.\nThe posterior superior temporal cortex, implicated in social cognition 76, was associated with loneliness in four studies 25,26,32,61.\nThe hippocampus, known for its role in memory 77, and the cerebellum, known for sensorimotor coordination as well as cognitive and affective processes 78,79 each had three papers that associated their function or structure with loneliness.\nAttentional networks are responsible for effortful versus environmental, stimulus-driven control of attention, and are localized to distinct anatomical areas with specific cognitive functions 80. Four publications reported that loneliness was associated with differences in ventral attentional (including TPJ), dorsal attentional, and cingulo-opercular networks, in terms of functional and effective connectivity 29,37,39,43. Attentional networks may be linked to hypervigilance and stress reactivity that are putatively involved in loneliness.\nVisual systems are responsible for processing visual information. Five studies reported associations of loneliness with differences in primary and secondary visual cortex in terms of volume 46, functional connectivity 43, causal flow 39, or activation with social images 25,63, supporting Cacioppo et al.s hypervigilance theory of loneliness 6.\nThe DMN is active when the human brain is at rest and is implicated in mental representations of self across time and space, theory of mind, and pro-social behaviors 81. Three studies showed an association between loneliness with DMN functional connectivity 43,47,51. One report noted more dense, less modular connections between attentional, visual, and DM networks in lonely persons. A recent large (n  40,000), multi-modal study (published after our cutoff date for inclusion in this review) reported increased volume and white matter structural connectivity as well as increased functional connectivity of the DMN in lonely individuals 82. Together, these results suggest that higherorder brain regions localized to PFC and DMN may play a critical role in loneliness. The DMN may be differentially activated when we are thinking about others; however, dysregulated activity in DMN may contribute to rumination and negative feelings associated with loneliness.\nTwo EEG studies showed that lonely individuals had faster ERPs to negative or threatening stimuli 30,33, consistent with the hypervigilance hypothesis of loneliness 6, while another report found no difference in ERPs with a nostalgia-related task 64.\nRegarding AD markers, two PET studies reported greater amyloid and tau burden 50,56, and one MRI study reported progressive increase in white matter hyperintensities among lonely older adults 53. However, one post-mortem study found no such differences in plaques, tangles, or infarcts 48. Two studies extracting RNA from the brain identified differential ADrelated gene expression in lonely individuals 52,55. The overall findings related to AD align with meta-analytic evidence linking loneliness to increased risk of AD 83.\nThe brain regions highlighted in this review of loneliness may also have roles in other related constructs. For example, we have found a strong inverse correlation between loneliness and wisdom, especially its compassion component 151617. An overview of the neurobiology of wisdom has highlighted the major roles of PFC, especially dlPFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate, and insula as well as amygdala 21,84. One MRI study reported that loneliness and empathy were inversely associated with white matter density in lateral PFC, insula, and TPJ 32, while another MRI study found no links with gray matter density 26. A recent EEG study demonstrated that loneliness and wisdomcompassion were related to contrasting modulations of cognitive processes, invoking similar (TPJ) and distinct (superior parietal vs. insula, respectively) neural circuits in specific emotional contexts 85. These relationships are correlational and warrant further study employing neurobiological perturbations.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "This review article as well as the included studies have limitations. It is possible that, despite our best efforts, we missed a few relevant papers. Also, we did not include articles in non-English languages, and 73 (3041) of the reports came from the USA or China, thereby limiting the generalizability to other countries. Most investigations were cross-sectional, preventing causal inferences. There may be confounding factors that are driving these relationships. There is risk of gender bias in self-reported assessments of loneliness. While there are no agreed upon objective measures of loneliness, indirect partial objective measures may include sedentary behavior assessed with wearable activity trackers, life space using GPS data, and sleep disturbances using wearable sensors. The studies included are limited by varied methodologies and analysis techniques in the rapidly evolving field of social neuroscience. For example, EEG has remarkable temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution while the reverse is true with fMRI 86. Many studies were hypothesis-generating and used single neurobiological modalities. Though one study included over 10,000 participants from the UK Biobank registry study 46, the majority (2541; 61) of the studies had fewer than 100 participants. Thus, most of the individual study findings are limited by small sample sizes, and overall generalizability may be low. Subject samples varied widely in sociodemographic characteristics, outcome measures, analysis protocols, and statistical methods, thereby precluding a metanalysis. It is not always clear if some brain regions not mentioned in the results had not been examined or were examined but not found to be significantly associated with loneliness.\nMost studies only assessed and controlled for a small number of covariates such as demographic variables including age and sex. However, the complex psychosocial nature of loneliness extends beyond these basic demographic factors. Objective health status, environmental characteristics, stress, mental health, and personality traits are important confounders that were not included in many of the analyses. Only two studies had samples that could example the relationship of age (across the adult lifespan) with the loneliness-neurobiology associations 62,63 59. Several, but not all, studies have examined depression as a confounder 38,58,59, and three case-control studies specifically examined the effect of loneliness for the neurobiological differences between people with depression and healthy controls 45,51,57. However, despite their potential impact, other constructs including grief, prolonged grief disorder, mild cognitive impairment, substance use disorders, and various stress-related conditions were not assessed and analyzed in most studies of loneliness.",

    "Future directions": {
      "text": "This systemic review of neurobiology of loneliness identified how loneliness is linked to specific brain regions and networks, including PFC, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, attentional networks, and DMN, and a strong relationship with AD. However, researchers will need to replicate and expand the quantity and quality of these studies to understand the brain processes underlying loneliness. Moving forward, task-based neurocircuitry fMRI studies and multi-modal imaging studies have promise, due to the complexity of social cognition and functioning. These approaches would be well-suited to loneliness interventions to identify associated changes in connectivity. Future studies should also include large and diverse samples of well-characterized subjects followed longitudinally, with hypothesis-based approaches and appropriate multivariate statistical analyses, to examine the role of age and other relevant factors.\nStudies should examine how the neurobiological findings are linked to other behaviors associated with loneliness-including sleep disturbances, sedentary behaviors, and limited life space. Assessments should include multi-modal assessments of social functioning-including use of social media, GPS-derived life space data, speech data, sleep, and ecological momentary assessments that examine loneliness as a state rather than a trait 87. Neurobiological assessments that examine structural and functional integrity or harness neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation can also provide novel insights into brain alterations associated with loneliness. Furthermore, RCTs of novel loneliness interventions and associated neurobiological changes are warranted. Such research will pave the way for the development of therapeutic and preventive interventions to manage the behavioral pandemic of loneliness.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) research has largely concentrated on the study of cognitive decline, but the associated behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are of equal importance in the clinical profile of the disease. Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation in AD. Clinical, multimodal neuroimaging studies and pathologic studies of apathy in AD have suggested an association with frontal dysfunction but without a definitive localization. In this study, we examined the association between apathy and white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Twenty-one AD patients underwent DTI and neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments. All fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were normalized to the standard space, and the association between the apathy scale and DTI metrics were evaluated voxel basically. Results: Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed that there were statistically negative correlations between the apathy scale and FA values in the right anterior cingulate, right thalamus, and bilateral parietal regions using age, Mini-Mental State Examination score and sex as nuisance variables. Conclusions: Apathy in AD is associated with impaired white matter integrity in the anterior cingulate and medial thalamus. These results reinforce the confluence of evidence from other investigational modalities in implicating limbic dysfunction and related neuronal circuits in the neurobiology of apathy in AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) research has largely concentrated on the study of cognitive decline, but neuropsychiatric symptoms also occur frequently and are very distressing to the caregiver. Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation in AD, reported to occur in 29-72 of patients (Lyketsos et al., 2000;Mega et al., 1996). Apathy has been defined as the absence or lack of feeling, emotion, interest, concern, or motivation not attributable to a decreased level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress (Marin, 1991). Given the large overlap of apathy and depression, the apathy is sometimes regarded as at least subsyndromal depression. However, the previous study showed the validity of apathy as a behavioral syndrome independent from depression (Starkstein et al., 2001). Previous gray matter volume studies and cerebral blood flow studies of apathy in AD have suggested an association with dysfunction of the frontal cortices (Craig et al., 1996;Bruen et al., 2008), orbitofrontal cortices (Benoit et al., 2004), anterior cingulate (Migneco et al., 2001;Bruen et al., 2008), thalamus (Marshall et al., 2007), and temporoparietal cortices (Ott et al., 1996). A pathologic study has pointed out an association between apathy and anterior cingulate neurofibrillary tangle counts (Marshall et al., 2006).\nAlthough the pathology of AD mainly involves the cerebral gray matter volume state, evidence of white matter abnormalities in AD has been revealed by the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. One study investigated whether the white matter damage is related to gray matter atrophy in AD patients and suggested that the observed patterns of white matter abnormalities might reflect the advanced phase of a secondary degenerative process, and an association, especially in the early phase of the disease, with primary white matter tract damage over and above gray matter abnormalities (Agosta et al., 2011). However, there has been no DTI study that has concentrated on the association between apathy and structural brain changes. This study was designed to establish more specific focal anatomical correlations between regional change and apathy using the method of voxel-based correlation analysis on DTI scans.",

The evaluation included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a global measure of cognitive deficits, and the apathy scale, a 14-item scale for rating the severity of symptoms of apathy (Starkstein et al., 1995).

      "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 1.0 T Magnetom Harmony system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a head coil. High-spatial resolution, 3-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images were used for morphometric study. The 3D T1-weighted images were acquired in the sagittal plane (repetition time (TR)echo time (TE), 20803.93; flip angle, 15; effective section thickness, 1.23 mm; slab thickness, 177 mm; matrix, 208 Â 256; field of view (FOV), 256 Â 315 mm; number of signals acquired, 1), yielding 144 contiguous slices through the brain. In addition to 3D T1-weighted images, to exclude cerebrovascular disease, we acquired conventional axial T2-weighted turbo spin echo images (TRTE, 400095; slice thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 1.8 mm; matrix, 512 Â 432; FOV, 230 Â 194 mm; number of signals acquired, 1) and coronal FLAIR images (TRTEinversion time msec, 90001042500; slice thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 1.5 mm; matrix, 512 Â 448; FOV, 230 Â 202 mm; number of signals acquired, 1). DTI was performed in the axial plane (TRTE, 10100113; FOV, 230 Â 230 mm; matrix, 128 Â 128; 40 continuous transverse slices; slice thickness, 3 mm with no intersection gap). To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, the acquisition was repeated five times. Diffusion was measured along 12 noncollinear directions with the use of a diffusion-weighted factor b in each direction for 700 smm 2 , and one image was acquired without the use of a diffusion gradient. To reduce eddy-current-induced distortion, the twicerefocused spin echo sequence was used (Reese et al., 2003). The signal-to-noise ratio in the b  0 image was roughly 30 in the central semi-ovale. This was large enough to accurately estimate the parameters (Hunsche et al., 2001). The DTI examination took approximately 11 min, the 3D T1-weighted images 7 min, the T2-weighted turbo spin echo images 2 min, and the coronal FLAIR images 3 min. Raw diffusion tensor data were transferred to a workstation, and DTI data sets were analyzed using DtiStudio software (H. Jiang, S. Mori; Johns Hopkins University). The diffusion tensor elements were obtained from b  0 and 12 diffusion weighted images. The diffusion tensor was then diagonalized, yielding eigenvalues l 1 , l 2 , and l 3 as well as eigenvectors that define the predominant diffusion orientation. We calculated the b  0 image and FA based on the eigenvalues.",

    "Data post-processing": {
      "text": "To estimate the relationships between brain morphology and the apathy scale, FA images were analyzed voxel basically. Data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (SPM5) software (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) running on MATLAB 7.0 (Math Works, Natick, MA). First, each individual 3D-T1 image was coregistered and resliced to its own b  0 image. Next, the coregistered 3D-T1 image was normalized to the avg152T1 image regarded as the anatomically standard image in SPM5. Finally, the transformation matrix was applied to the FA map. Each map was then spatially smoothed with a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel in order to decrease spatial noise and compensate for the inexactitude of normalization following the rule of thumb developed for functional MRI and positron emission tomography studies (Snook et al., 2007).",

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows 11.0.1 J software (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Correlations between regional gray matter volume, FA value, and apathy score were assessed using age, MMSE score, and sex as nuisance variables because apathy correlates with lower cognitive functions as measured by the MMSE (Levy et al., 1998). Only correlations that met these criteria were deemed statistically significant. In this case, a seed level of p  0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster level of p  0.05 (uncorrected) were selected.\nPrevious studies showed the efficacy of donepezil on apathy in AD (Riepe et al., 2007;Waldemar et al., 2011).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the association between apathy and regional brain change revealed by DTI. This study found significant negative correlations between the apathy scale and FA values of the anterior cingulate, right thalamus, and bilateral parietal regions. The atrophy of elements of the limbic circuit, including the cingulate gyrus, has been observed in Alzheimers disease. Previous studies using dynamic measures of brain function in Alzheimers disease patients with apathy have predominantly reported dysfunction in the anterior cingulatemedial frontal areas (Lanctot et al., 2007;Migneco et al., 2001), although one study showed involvement of the medial thalamus (Marshall et al., 2007). Neuropathological and structural studies showed the involvement of similar cortical regions in apathetic Alzheimers disease patients (Apostolova et al., 2007;Marshall et al., 2006;Rosen et al., 2005;Tekin et al., 2001). A crucial function of the anterior cingulate cortex is related to the initiation and motivational drivers for goaldirected activities, particularly when these are effortful, and damage to this cortical structure would likely, therefore, lead to a degree of behavioral and cognitive inertia (Allman et al., 2001;Devinsky et al., 1995).\nThe medial dorsal nucleus of the thalami may be important in assigning internal relevance to external stimuli that a person encounters. The nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain has cholinergic projections to the frontal limbic cortical regions, medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and midline thalamus. Dysfunction of neural systems in these projection fields may be related to the development of apathy in AD (Mega et al., 1997). The thalamus is also known to be related to cognitive function (Ota et al., 2009).\nA previous study showed that the severity of apathy correlates with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE (Levy et al., 1998). Our results showed a negative correlation between the apathy scale and the FA value in AD only when we included the MMSE score as a covariate. These factors may affect our analysis.\nThe medial orbitofrontal region has reciprocal connections with the anterior cingulate. Previous positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies showed the association between apathy and the orbitofrontal cortices (Benoit et al., 2004;Marshall et al., 2007). However, we could not detect this correlation in this study. We took the DTI scan using echo-planar imaging, and it has been found that the local susceptibility gradients may cause image distortions near the airtissue interface, such as the orbitofrontal region (Deichmann et al., 2003). Such distortions may have affected our results.\nWe showed a certain level of relationship between the FA value and apathy scale when we considered the efficacy of donepezil. In this study, a few of our participants took donepezil, and durations of medication were not aligned. It is known that prolonged use reduce the donepezil efficacy (Winblad et al., 2006). Further works that aligned medication status will be necessary to confirm this point.\nIn this study, we detected a correlation between the apathy scale and FA values in the parietal regions. However, the previous studies did not show such a relationship. One study showed that AD patients with depression had a et al., 2009), and another study suggest that parietal region were potentially critical to the negative mood (Mayberg et al., 1999). Some neuropsychiatric studies that have focused on apathy and depression showed that these symptoms may co-occur or appear independently and that in 24 of the AD sample, apathy co-existed with mood disorder (Starkstein et al., 2001). Meanwhile, another study showed that there was no correlation between apathy and depression in AD patients (Levy et al., 1998). In the present study, we found a relationship between the severity of apathy and the FA value in the parietal region. This may result from the fact that many of the participants of our study developed the symptoms of apathy and depression, and this may have influenced the neuroimaging analysis. Further neuroimaging work in conjunction with sufficient neuropsychological tests will be necessary to confirm this point.",

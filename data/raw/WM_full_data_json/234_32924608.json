    "abstract": "Objective:  18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain in ALS patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia (ALS-FTD) reveal hypometabolism and hypermetabolism, as well as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) abnormalities in different brain regions, respectively. Hypometabolism arising from neuronal dysfunction or loss is the most recognized pathophysiologic change in neurodegeneration, whereas mechanisms underlying hypermetabolism remain unclear. We hypothesize that hypometabolic and hypermetabolic brain regions in ALS-FTD represent differential degeneration of GM and WM structures, as revealed by co-registered MRI in a two time-point longitudinal multimodal study. Methods: A 69-year-old female with ALS-FTD underwent 18 F-FDG PET, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and T1-weighted MRI at baseline (15 months after symptom onset), and 20.4 months later. Cerebral glucose metabolism rate, cortical thickness, cortical area, and WM network changes were measured longitudinally. Results and conclusion: The patient had symptoms and signs of bulbar-onset upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant ALS with language and behavioral dysfunction. Evaluation at baseline showed bulbar dysfunction, and impaired language and executive function. At follow-up, worsened bulbar and other motor functions, and prominent FTD both reflected significant progression. Cortical thickness and surface area showed differential involvement in the hypometabolic and hypermetabolic regions. WM connections from frontal regions to other brain regions were completely absent by graph theory-based network analysis when compared to temporal regions indicating prominent frontal lobe degeneration. Structural neuroimaging reveals different patterns of GM and WM involvement in the hypometabolic and hypermetabolic brain regions in a patient with ALS-FTD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of white matter (WM) consistently reveals corticospinal tract (CST) degeneration in ALS patients (1)(2)(3)(4). Recent novel quantitative approaches such as graph theory-based WM network analysis (5) have demonstrated impairment of WM tracts underlying motor and extramotor brain regions in ALS. Significant gray matter (GM) atrophy is also found in ALS patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia (ALS-FTD) (6)(7)(8). Multimodal studies combining functional  18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET) with structural MRI (8-10) reveal a deeper understanding of ALS pathophysiology. Early 18 F-FDG PET studies in ALS showed only hypometabolism in motor and extramotor brain regions (11,12), while subsequent studies have demonstrated hypermetabolic changes as well (13)(14)(15). Dysfunction or loss of cortical neurons results in hypometabolism, which is the commonest pathophysiologic change in ALS, while mechanisms causing hypermetabolism remain unclear.\nIn addition to neurons, astrocytes and microglia utilize glucose, so changes in 18 F-FDG PET activity also reflect neuroglial metabolism (16,17).\nHypermetabolism has been associated with colonization of pyramidal tract by active astrocytes and or microglia in ALS (18), and has been observed in ALS spinal cord, even when the same patients brain showed hypometabolism (15). Another suggested cause of glucose hypermetabolism in ALS is functional reorganization of brain regions and compensatory activation (recruitment) of adjacent (motor or extramotor) regions (19).\nOur recent multimodal longitudinal study of a patient with ALS-FTD revealed both hypometabolism and hypermetabolism by 18 F-FDG PET, as well as decrease andor increase in cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA) of GM by MRI in frontal, temporal and other extramotor regions (10). We were intrigued by the co-occurrence of such contrasting metabolic and structural changes in similar left hemisphere brain areas. In the present study, our aim is to determine whether such brain regions with hypometabolism and hypermetabolism possess divergent structural GM and WM changes of degeneration. Therefore, here we use quantitative MRI GM (CT, CSA) and graph theory-based WM network measures on specific regions of interest (ROIs) displaying both hypometabolism and hypermetabolism, specifically: left middle and inferior frontal gyri (orbital part), as well as left middle and superior temporal gyri (including temporal pole). We hypothesize that GM and WM structures are more severely damaged in hypermetabolic areas compared to hypometabolic areas of ALS-FTD brain.",

Between baseline (first) and follow-up (second) time-points, neurologic, and psychometric evaluations revealed marked decline in executive functions, language (both expressive and receptive), speech, and limb strength with predominant UMN dysfunction of especially the right body. This pattern of progressive cognitive decline was consistent with worsening FTD that produced aphasia (in addition to anarthria), which along with worsening motor dysfunction was most consistent with the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variant of ALS-FTD. C9orf72 gene test was negative for expansion mutation. More clinical details are available in Ref. (10).",

      "text": "At each time point, CT and CSA from MRI, and cerebral glucose metabolism rate from FDG-PET were obtained. Longitudinal MRI data processing was performed using openware Freesurfer 5.1 (20). The pipeline consists of creating a base template to which images from two time points were registered. Other steps included: placing graywhite matter and gray matter-CSF boundaries, deforming of cortex for surface inflation, registration to atlas, and calculation of CT and CSA. 18 F-FDG PET images were processed using openware SPM 8 (21). First, images at each time point were registered to Dementia-Specific 18F-FDG-PET template from 100 subjects in MNI space (22). Registered images were then smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm and a symmetrized percent change (SPC) map for the whole brain was calculated. Hypometabolic and hypermetabolic brain regions were identified from the SPC maps, as detailed in Ref. (10). Brain regions showing significant metabolic, CT and CSA changes were identified with the automated anatomic label (AAL) MNI atlas.\nWhite matter network analysis using DTI DTI data were processed using openware ExploreDTI (23). After eddy current and motion correction, data were fitted to diffusion tensor model using robust diffusion tensor estimation approach, with subsequent whole brain tractography using deterministic streamline approach. Connectivity matrices were then obtained using the AAL atlas ROIs (24) after 116 ROIs from this atlas template were registered to the subjects space for each time point.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The main findings in this longitudinal study of a right hand-dominant patient with the PPA variant of ALS-FTD include: (1) differential abnormalities of GM CT and CSA measures exist between hypometabolic and hypermetabolic left brain areas within the same ROIs and demonstrate a distinct pattern of atrophy between frontal and temporal lobes; (2) no WM connections are revealed by graph theory network analysis between left frontal lobe and other brain regions at both time-points;\n(3) all WM connections from the left temporal lobe to other brain regions are lost between first and second time-points; (4) fewer WM connections arise from hypermetabolic areas than hypometabolic ones, and are completely absent at both time-points from hypermetabolic areas in the left superior temporal gyrus (including temporal pole). This suggests that hypermetabolic cortical areas are associated with more severely affected underlying WM connections than are hypometabolic areas.\nIn general, hypometabolic areas revealed both increased and decreased CT and CSA, whereas hypermetabolic areas showed only decreased CT and increased CSA. Although, this study does not answer whether metabolic ( 18 F-FDG PET) or structural (MRI) changes occur first, hypometabolism is more intuitive in the setting of neuronal degeneration, and has been recognized more frequently than hypermetabolism in previous studies of ALS and ALS-FTD brain. Hypermetabolic areas analyzed in our ALS-FTD patient contained cortical thinning, increased CSA, and subcortical degeneration represented by reduced WM connectivity, which was more marked than in hypometabolic areas. These regions of neuronal degeneration undoubtedly contain proliferating astrocytes and microglia (gliosis), which themselves consume glucose (16,25), and contribute to the hypermetabolic signal.\nCT is attributed to the number of cells in a cortical column whereas CSA represents the number of such cortical columns (26). In addition to cell number, CT is also influenced by variations in myelination within GM or WM (27). CSA, which is also influenced by WM myelination (28) will be altered by degeneration of WM or GM. Because CT and CSA are genetically unrelated and behave independently (27), they can change in opposing directions (29), as seen in our study. Although, neuroinflammation and gliosis follow neurodegeneration, they may be primary (preceding) events in certain cases or stages of ALS. Activation of astrocytes and microglia during early stages of inflammation may contribute to cortical thickening as they hypertrophy, proliferate, extend and interdigitate their processes (30). This could explain the cortical thickening and decreased CSA we observed in the superior and middle temporal gyri of the hypometabolic areas. We propose that the stage of underlying neurodegeneration determines the type and extent of structural (CT, CSA) and metabolic changes in frontal and temporal brain regions.\nAbsence of WM connections from left frontal gyri to the insula, anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus already at baseline likely contributed to deficits in emotion, attention, working memory, and cognition observed in this ALS-FTD patient. In comparison, hypometabolic areas in temporal lobe regions showed connectivity at baseline and even at the second time point in middle temporal gyrus regions, suggesting earlier or greater degeneration in the left frontal lobe. Most middle temporal gyrus regions losing WM connectivity from hypometabolic areas at the second time point play important roles in language, memory, visual, spatial, and other cognitive functions.\nWe found the nodal degree to be significantly lower in hypermetabolic areas than in hypometabolic ones, suggesting that hypermetabolism represents regions with more severe neurodegeneration. This was especially true for the left superior temporal gyrus (including temporal pole), which is involved in auditory processing and comprehension of language.",

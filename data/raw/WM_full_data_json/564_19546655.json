    "abstract": "Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a predementia state, but its definition is inconsistent and only 20-30 develop dementia after 2 years. Biomarkers may help identify individuals at greatest risk of progressive decline. The authors examine a novel neuroimaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a potential biomarker of MCI. Design: Cross-sectional prospective study. Setting: Subjects were recruited randomly using the electoral roll from two electorates in East Sydney, Australia. Participants: A community-dwelling sample (N ϭ 249) and age 70 -90 years. Measurements: Screening to exclude dementia, comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment, cognitive test battery, structural magnetic resonance imaging and DTI to obtain measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). MCI was diagnosed by standard criteria. Results: After controlling for age, sex, and years of education, the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group demonstrated microstructural pathology in the parahippocampal white matter, frontal white matter, splenium of corpus callosum, and posterior cingulate region. The nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) group demonstrated microstructural pathology in the frontal white matter, internal capsule, occipital white matter, and the posterior cingulate region. A binary logistic regression model showed that DTI of the left posterior cingulate was significant in identifying persons with aMCI to an accuracy of 85.1. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis yielded a sensitivity of 80 and specificity of 60.3 in distinguishing aMCI from naMCI and the normal comparison group. Conclusion: DTI of the posterior cingulate region discriminates MCI from cognitively",

(Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2009; 17:602-613) Key Words: Diffusion tensor imaging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease D ementia has a global prevalence of about 24 million, with this figure set to double every 20 years. 1 If the hope of preventing or delaying the onset of dementia is to be realized, early identification of individuals at risk of dementia will be necessary. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed in recent years to be a distinct clinical entity that represents this predementia state. 2 However, longitudinal reports of subjects with MCI have revealed that this clinical syndrome displays vast heterogeneity. 3 For it to become a useful clinical entity, biomarkers that reliably distinguish individuals with MCI from those with normal cognition (NC) and predict the progression of MCI to dementia would be necessary. This area presents a need that is currently not being met. 4 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to examine the integrity of white matter, and offers the advantage of identifying pathology not always visible on structural MRI. DTI captures the diffusion characteristics of water in vivo to allow visualization and quantification of fiber tracts using measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). 5 FA is a measure of white matter integrity and MD is a measure of free water diffusion. FA decreases when there is decreased coherence due to microstructural pathology such as myelination defects in the fiber tract. MD increases when there is an increase in extracellular space as a result of fiber loss. Collectively, these measures reflect microstructural alterations and neurodegenerative processes in the brains, and are potentially of value in the assessment of dementia patients. This imaging technique may therefore be potentially useful in providing information about the microstructural connectivity within the brain that might inform us about the structures, which are involved at different time points of the ageing process.\nA recent review by us suggests that MCI individuals have abnormalities demonstrable using DTI in structures involved in memory and cognition (chiefly frontal white matter, hippocampus, the posterior cingulate, and the temporal white matter). 6 However, the studies reviewed were limited by their small sample sizes (Ͻ80 total subjects), use of convenient samples recruited from memorydementia clinics, and nonstandard diagnostic criteria for MCI. These studies have also shown that microstructural abnormalities detectable by DTI is potentially useful as a diagnostic tool for MCI. 7,8 This report details a comparative study of DTI in a large randomly acquired community sample, comprising MCI and comparison of NC subjects to further elucidate microstructural changes in the ageing brain that may characterize these clinical syndromes. We subcategorized MCI into amnestic MCI (aMCI) and nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) to examine the specificity of any abnormalities and their possible pathogenetic relationships.",

A gradient table was constructed for each subject to take into account every individuals unique acquisition parameters, such as different slice angulations, by using the software DTI gradient table creator. 20 Subsequently, FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool was used to align all the images of a subject before estimating diffusion-related measures (i.e., diffusion tensor, principal diffusion direction and FA). 21 Using the FM-RIBs Diffusion Toolbox, the tensor eigenvalues were calculated and FA and MD maps were produced. 22 A regions of interest (ROI) approach was taken to study FA and MD measures using Analyze (v7) (Mayo Clinic Ventures, Rochester, MI) by placing objects individually and manually on images acquired without diffusion gradient (b ϭ 0 smm 2 ) simultaneously with FA and MD maps. The size of the objects in each ROI was fixed among the subjects and placement was performed carefully to avoid partial volume effects. A standardized approach for object placement in the ROI was adopted by using a protocol, which was established from referencing the fiber tract-based atlas of human white matter anatomy. 23 ROIs examined included the frontal and occipital white matter, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus and white matter, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, hippocampus and parahippocampal subgyrus white matter, putamen, caudate, superior longitudinal fasiculus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and internal capsule. A sample of how the ROIs were traced on the FA and MD maps is shown in Fig 2 . The average size of each ROI was 140 mm 3 . Reliability analysis was performed by comparing FA values in the ROIs traced by the primary author (TCC) and a coauthor (XC) in 10 subjects on two instances, once before commencement and again after the first 200 subjects to avoid a consistency drift.

We formed two groups for the regression analysis: aMCI and combined NC and naMCI groups. This permitted the distinction of aMCI from a variously defined second group in our logistic regression model. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic classification us-ing FA and MD values from the region that best predicted aMCI from our regression model, we computed the sensitivity and specificity of the measures using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Further calculations were then performed to obtain the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the measures.

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "The aims of our study were to use DTI to examine microstructural abnormality in MCI and its subtypes and to evaluate its utility as a diagnostic tool in the predementia work-up. We found that microstructural abnormalities occurring in aMCI tend to occur in the regions receiving efferent outputs from the entorhinal-hippocampal system and in naMCI tend to occur in more diverse regions. We also observed fair overall diagnostic utility of DTI measures of the posterior cingulate region in aMCI.\nThe findings of FA reduction and increase in MD are thought to reflect microscopic pathology such as demyelination or axonal losses that lead to a loss of microstructural integrity. 24 Such changes in the brain may not be identifiable on structural MRI and knowledge of this underlying pathology provides us with further understanding of the pathological processes of dementia. The added value of the study, in distinguishing the different subtypes of MCI, provides further understanding into the heterogeneity of the syndrome of MCI. As sufferers eventually reach different endpoints, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 2 it can be argued that early AD is most likely to present as aMCI. 2 Our results parallel the findings of DTI studies in MCI, which have recently been reviewed. 6 The lower FA and higher MD in the posterior cingulate gray and white matter in aMCI and naMCI are consistent with previous reports. 25,26 This is not surprising as the posterior cingulate region is connected to the entorhinal cortex which has reciprocal connections to the hippocampus and thus forms an integral component of the medial temporal lobe memory system. This brain region has been demonstrated to show abnormality in other neuroimaging and neu-ropathological studies of MCI. Positron emission tomography studies, which used a ligand that binds to amyloid plaque to demonstrate in vivo plaque distribution, showed a significant increase in binding of the ligand in the posterior cingulate region in MCI, 27 in particular aMCI. 28 Neurometabolite abnormalities detected using magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed greater myoinositolcreatine ratios in the posterior cingulate of MCI subjects. 29,30 The increased myoinositol levels have been correlated with disease progression and neurofibrillary tangles in ageing and AD. 31 The presence of abnormality in the posterior cingulate region has also been verified by autopsy studies. 32,33 In the aMCI group, other significant findings include DTI changes in the parahippocampal subgyrus white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum. Both these regions form the posterior circuitry, which is implicated in AD. There were also lower FA and higher MD values in the left hippocampus of the aMCI group, which was not significant after controlling for the covariates. These findings support the hypothesis that the posterior circuitry comprising structures involved in memory processes-hippocampus, parahippocampal subgyrus white matter, posterior cingulate, and splenium of corpus callosum-are greatly affected in aMCI. Assuming that this is due to neurodegeneration, the findings support the suggestion that aMCI represents an early stage of AD. 34,35 We also found changes in the anterior compartment of the brain, most notably in the frontal white matter and genu of the corpus callosum in the aMCI group. Such changes could be associated with microvascular diseases, which has been increasingly recognized to contribute to AD pathology to form a picture of mixed Alzheimer and vascular dementia. 36,37 Another explanation of this finding may be that microstructural pathology in the frontal white matter could be a result of neurodegeneration occurring in the entorhinal-hippocampal system that consequentially affects the structures it connects with in the frontal lobes. Furthermore, the frontal lobes demonstrate pathology early in the course of disease in many patients with AD. 38 DTI changes in the naMCI group seem to occur in quite diverse regions. We found the frontal white matter, occipital white matter, internal capsule, and the posterior cingulate to be affected in naMCI. Microstructural pathology in these regions could be a result of microvascular diseases or neocortical pathology due to AD and DLB. The clinical implications of these abnormalities in the frontal white matter and internal capsule may possibly reflect the cognitive deficits and motor impairment seen in MCI participants. Interestingly, changes occurring in the occipital white matter lead us to speculate on the relationship of our findings with the reported visuoperceptual impairment in DLB. 39 The posterior cingulate is less affected in naMCI than aMCI. We suggest that naMCI suffers might be the ones who go on to develop non-Alzheimer or a mixed form of dementia with the pathological burden in the brain being attributable to microvascular diseases and neurodegeneration due to diverse causes. However, without longitudinal follow-up toward a definitive diagnosis of dementia, this remains entirely speculative.\nWhen the aMCI and naMCI groups were compared, the distinguishing regions were the splenium of corpus callosum and the parahippocampal subgyrus white matter. The regions that differentiate between these two MCI subtypes parallel the different clinical symptoms that are seen in these two MCI subtype. With the emphasis on early involvement of medial temporal and parietal regions in aMCI, as a prelude to AD, the paraphippocampal white matter and splenium are more likely to be involved in aMCI.\nCurrent MCI diagnosis relies mainly on neuropsychological tests. There are several limitations to this approach. First, as no one specific neuropsychological test can diagnose cognitive status, a large battery of tests must be applied. This is time consuming, needs experienced clinicians for its administration and interpretations, and is often not well tolerated by elderly patients. Second, there are factors such as ethnic, cultural, and education attainment that confound performance on these tests. This study is a step toward sufficiently demonstrating the usefulness of a biomarker such as DTI of the posterior cingulate region in being able to detect aMCI with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. The low PPV (36.3) indicates that if used alone, FA measurement leads to many false-positive cases. Importantly, the NPV is high (91.4), indicating that false-negative rates are low. These findings must be interpreted in the context of a somewhat arbitrary categorization of our sample into MCI and NC based on a neuropsychological test criterion that was statistically derived and applied crosssectionally. The true test of the DTI measures will come from longitudinal data when their ability to predict progression of disease can be examined. Such data will answer the question whether DTI is a more discriminating measure than other biomarkers (positron emission tomography, MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, ApoE genotyping, proteomics) and whether it should be used alone or in combination with other predictor variables.\nThe major limitation of our study is that it is crosssectional, and the true value of a biomarker is in its prediction of long-term outcome. Longitudinal follow-up of this cohort is in progress to ascertain the prognostic ability of DTI. This limitation is partially offset by the large sample size and the systematic assessment of participants with detailed neuropsychological assessments and standardized diagnostic procedures. Although our ROIs did not specifically include white matter hyperintensities, the extent of these lesions could contribute to the overall clinical status and this was not accounted for. In addition, tractography could supersede ROI studies in studying fiber tracts as it provides information about the whole tract per se rather than just a point on the tract. Although the ROIs were placed strategically to assessment white matter, especially for FA measurement, it was not possible to completely exclude gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid from ROIs. Some partial volume effect must therefore be accepted. As only six directions DTI was performed, the consequences of inherent signal to noise ratio effects and tensor computation limitations are not negligible. Further work using a more robust DTI acquisition will minimize these effects. We used a ROI method of analysis which incorporates a priori hypotheses about the likely regions affected. Other methods of analysis, such as voxel-by-voxel comparisons can be performed without a priori assumptions and will be useful exploratory analyses of such data. Finally, although our sampling strategy was to randomly recruit individuals from the community using the electoral roll, only a proportion of subjects initially approached agreed to participate, thereby potentially introducing a bias in the sample. However, the effect of this bias would be minimal given the size of our study. Moreover, the prevalence rate of MCI in our study (38) is similar to reports from other community-based studies (3-36). 35,40 -42 Although it is at the higher end, it is logical given the older mean age of our participants.\nIn summary, this is the largest study to examine the potential of DTI as a biomarker of MCI and, despite its limitations, demonstrates that DTI, especially of the posterior cingulate region is a useful marker of aMCI in distinguishing it from individuals with NC for age. DTI may also be useful to distinguish aMCI from naMCI. Other regions that were found to be different between the groups may also be potentially useful as a biomarker. However, in our cohort, these regions did not perform well statistically. Therefore, DTI findings are important biomarkers of predementia syndromes, which awaits vali-dation in a longitudinal study before its general acceptance.",

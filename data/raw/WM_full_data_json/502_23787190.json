    "abstract": "To evaluate whether cerebral white matter integrity is related to cognitive function, and whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could differentiate amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from Alzheimers disease (AD), 12 patients with AD, 12 with aMCI, and 12 controls were recruited for this study. Cognitive functions of all subjects were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). DTI studies were acquired, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple brain regions were obtained. Results showed that MMSE and ADAS-Cog subscores were significantly associated with white matter integrity of the temporal-parietal lobes. A decrease in FA values and an increase in MD values in multiple cortical regions were confirmed in patients with AD compared to controls. MD values in the posterior region of the corpus callosum in aMCI differed from those of early AD. Significant reductions of FA values in the NAWM of the parietal lobe was observed in aMCI compared to controls. Our data indicate that the microstructural white matter integrity in the temporal-parietal lobes is gradually impaired in the progressive process of AD, and that splenium MD values could be used as a biomarker differentiating aMCI from AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterised by significant cognitive impairment, widespread cerebral atrophy of the medial temporal lobes and the temporoparietal association cortices, as well as substantial involvement of the frontal lobes. 1,2 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been regarded as an intermediate state between normal aging and Alzheimers disease (AD), 3,4 and the majority of patients with amnestic subtype MCI (aMCI) will eventually develop AD. 5 Recent neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have shown that cortical grey matter and the white matter underlying these cortical regions are also affected in patients with AD. 2,6,7 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recently developed MRI technique with the capability to detect water molecule diffusion direction and magnitude, a reflection of brain structure, morphology, and white matter abnormality, in vivo. DTI has been used to exam-ine the integrity of white matter fibre bundles in aging 8910 and aging-related nervous system disorders by measuring directional diffusion (fractional anisotrophy FA) and translational diffusion (mean diffusivity MD). 11,12 Several DTI studies have shown reduced FA andor increased MD in the regions of the bilateral hippocampi and parahippocampal, amygdala, frontal, and parieto-occipital lobes, 111213 the splenium of the corpus callosum, 13,14 bilateral subventricular zone, 15 late-myelinating pathways, 16 and anterior and posterior cingulate fibre tracts 17181920 in patients with AD compared to normal controls. In AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores measuring clinical cognitive performance have been related to FA values in the splenium of the corpus callosum 212223 and MD values in the posterior cingulate tracts. 24,25 Executive and memory dysfunction has been related to frontal and temporal white matter abnormality, respectively. 23,26 Moreover, a recent study showed that regardless of white matter atrophy and lesion volume, the microstructural integrity of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) was associated with cognitive function at the cerebral global level. 27 However, it is not known whether this association also occurs at the cerebral regional level, or which brain regions predominate in the progressive cognitive decline in the devastating process of AD.\nTo investigate cognitive decline in the progression of AD, we included patients with aMCI for this study, as aMCI probably represents a part of the continuum that spans from normal ageing to AD. Based on the recent finding that deterioration of NAWM integrity is related to cognitive dysfunction, regardless of overall macrostructural white matter changes, 27 this study aimed to elucidate the region-specific sequential progression of brain tissue involvement in the progression of AD and identify potential differentiation imaging markers for aMCI and AD.",

      "text": "Participants with cognitive complaints were recruited for this study from patients evaluated at the Department of Neurology of HeBei General Hospital, and from the local community. Age-and gender-matched controls, without neurological disorders, were recruited from the local community. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of HeiBei General Hospital, and all participants gave informed consent.\nChinese versions of the MMSE, Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Hachinski Ischemic Scale were administered to all subjects enrolled in this study. National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) 28 and Petersens diagnostic criteria 29,30 were adapted for probable diagnosis of AD and aMCI. Briefly, the classification diagnosis was established by consensus between two senior neurologists, who examined each participant independently. Individuals were classified as MCI if they demonstrated a deficit of at least 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the expected age-and-education corrected mean in at least one cognitive domain of composite scores of ADAS-Cog. 29 Patients were also classified as aMCI or non-aMCI, and further classified as being single domain amnestic, multiple domain amnestic, single domain non-amnestic, or multiple domain non-amnestic MCI. aMCI was defined on the basis of either learning or delayed recall decrements. Subjects with cerebral white matter hyperintensity, more than two lacunar lesions revealed by MRI T2weighted imaging, or with major systemic (folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, for instance), psychiatric and other neurological illnesses (patients with an Hachinski Ischemic Scale score more than 4, for instance) were excluded from this study. Furthermore, AD patients with CDR-3, who often had cerebral vascular abnormalities, were excluded in this study.\nA total of 12 AD patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive decline (six male and six female, 63-85 years old at recruitment, CDR 1-2, MMSE scores of 11-22), and 12 patients with aMCI (five male and seven female, 61-82 years old at recruitment, CDR-0.5, MMSE scores ranging of 21-26) were included in the study (Table 1). In addition, 12 normal subjects (five male and seven female, 63-83 years old at recruitment, MMSE score of 26 or more, and similar educational background history to participants in the other groups) were recruited as controls. There was a 21 overlap in MMSE scores between members of the AD and aMCI groups, 29 between members of the aMCI group and controls, and no MMSE score overlap between participants with AD and controls (Table 1).",

      "text": "Conventional axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and DTI sequences were acquired with a 3.0-Tesla MRI machine (SIGNA EXCITE II, GE HealthCare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Before scanning, a homogeneous magnetic field was established to reduce image distortion. Axial DTI images with 25 diffusion encoding directions were obtained using a single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging protocol (SS-SE-EPI, TETR  79.3 8000 ms; matrix 128 Â 128; field of view FOV 240 mm Â 240 mm; slice thickness 5 mm; slice gap 0 mm; with 20 orientations for the diffusion sensitising gradients at b-values of 0 smm 2 and 1000 smm 2 ). After scanning, the original DTI data were transferred to a workstation and processed using Functool2 software (GE HealthCare, Buc, France), with eddy current correction by affine registration to a reference scan, without diffusion weighting, brain skull extraction, and diffusion tensor calculation.\nNAWM was defined by normal signal intensity on standard T1weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images. Small oval ROI were drawn manually by an experienced neurologist (WJH) on axial slices acquired without diffusion gradients (b  0 smm 2 ) on NAWM, bilaterally, in the middle frontal lobes, the angular gyri of the parietal lobes, the superior temporal lobes, the occipital poles, the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Specific locations were selected according to both color maps and anatomic landmarks (Supplementary Fig. 1). ROI of NAWM in the parietal lobe were positioned on three contiguous slices of the angular gyri (Supplementary Fig. 1, column 1). The ROI of the splenium of the corpus callosum was positioned in two adjacent axial slices using the ventral midbrain and the splenium of the corpus callosum as anatomic landmarks (Supplementary Fig. 1, column 2). ROI in the frontal lobes were sampled on three contiguous slices of the middle frontal gyri starting from the most inferior section in which the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles in both hemispheres were visible (Supplementary Fig. 1, column 3). ROI of the occipital lobes were placed on three contiguous slices of the occipital apex starting from the most inferior section on which the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle was visible (Supplementary Fig. 1,column 3). ROI in the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule were selected on three contiguous slices indexed as the regions bounded by the corner between the head of the caudate nucleus and the pallidum, and by the pallidum and the thalamus (Supplementary Fig. 1,column 3). ROI in the temporal lobes were positioned posterolaterally to the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle on three contiguous sections starting from the most inferior section in which the body of the hippocampus was visible (Supplementary Fig. 1, column 4). Care was taken to avoid partial volume averaging due to inclusion of pixels depicting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or cortical gray matter. To validate the application of the manual ROI approach, the same rater repeated ROI drawings on 10 randomly selected subjects, blinded to the previous evaluation. The intraclass correlation coefficient between previous and repeated measures was 0.95. MD and FA maps, and axial diffusion tensor tractography of 13 ROI were constructed (Supplementary Fig. 1), and an average of the bilateral FA and MD values of each ROI was calculated.",

A sequential trend of FA reduction was observed in the NAWM of multiple cortices moving from control to aMCI and AD. A significant reductions of FA values in the parietal cortex of aMCI compared to controls was observed (Fig. 1), suggesting limited white matter integrity disturbance in aMCI. In contrast, MD values were more sensitive than FA values in distinguishing aMCI from AD, in that MD values were significantly increased in AD compared to aMCI in the NAWM of the frontal (p 6 0.05) and parietal lobes (p 6 0.01), and most significantly in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p 6 0.001) (Fig. 1).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We found that microstructural abnormalities in the temporal and parietal lobes as detected on DTI are strongly associated with disease progression. Microstructural abnormalities in the splenium of the corpus callosum were related to cognitive impairments in different domains (Table 2). Furthermore, MD values of the splenium of the corpus callosum could distinguish aMCI from AD (Figs. 1 and2). Our findings were based on strict subject recruitment criteria (that is, normal signal intensity on standard MRI T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images of all subjects, and patients with AD with CDR 6 2).\nEven at early stages of AD, the function-critical neural network is disturbed, with reduced FA values in multiple cortical regions. 21222326,31,32 This study confirms that FA values in parietal NAWM are the major correlates with general cognitive function (Table 2). 21222324252633,34 Parietal NAWM is widely recognised as a key parietal node of the default mode network, 35 having a strong structural connection with the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. 36,37 It plays an important role in language and semantic processing, spatial attention, orientation, and verbally-mediated fact retrieval during mathematical cognition tasks. 37 As a result, white matter impairment in the parietal NAWM leads to general overall cognitive dysfunction. Impaired white matter integrity in the posterior corpus callosum is related to word recall and word recognition (Table 2), possibly due to disconnection between the splenium and the occipital, temporal, and parietal cortices. 38,39 A gradual sequential decrease in FA values from aged controls compared to aMCI, and a further decrease for AD was found in NAWM of multiple cortical regions (Fig. 1). This decrease was predictive of eventual conversion from aMCI to AD, as shown in previous studies using a different ROI selection scheme. 2,13,18,40 In AD, FA values were decreased and MD values were increased in comparison to values in NAWM of multiple regions in aMCI (Fig. 1). 1112131441 These changes have been attributed to altered water diffusion properties due to extracellular senile plaque accumulation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation in cortical regions, 40 Wallerian degeneration, 42,43 and an inflammatory process. 44 MD values at the splenium significantly discriminate aMCI from AD (Figs. 1 and2). The splenium of the corpus callosum is located immediately inferior to the cingulate gyrus, and it continues as the parahippocampal gyrus of the temporal lobe. Thus, the splenium of corpus callosum is a part of the neocortical commissural nerve fibers, and is destroyed primarily due to Wallerian degeneration, resulting in a myelin breakdown process in AD. 42,43,45 The differences in MD values between aMCI and AD may reflect irreversible Wallerian and axonal degeneration in the prodromal stage of AD, and support the notion of prodromal intervention for AD treatment.\nCurrent differentiation of aMCI from AD relies on several neuropsychological tests conducted by experienced clinicians, as well as clinical history gathering. This is time consuming and often not well tolerated by the elderly. In addition, other factors, such as ethnic, cultural, and education attainment, may confound performance on these tests. This study demonstrated the usefulness of MD values at the splenium of the corpus callosum as a biomarker differentiating aMCI from AD (Fig. 2). The microstructural changes of the splenium detected by DTI have previously been proposed as a biomarker to discriminate aMCI from non-aMCI. 46,47 DTI measures on the splenium would provide prognostic information for patients with cognitive complaints, and appropriate prevention approaches developed for individuals with aMCI to prevent conversion to AD. Furthermore, DTI measures could be used for prodromal AD case selection during clinical trial.\nThe limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design, since longitudinal follow-up is required to fully ascertain the ability of DTI to predict disease progression. Although this study has a small sample size, similar conclusions have been drawn from studies based on larger cohorts, but without the strict subject recruitment criteria employed in this study. 46,47 In addition, since most Chinese words are composed of phono-semantic compound characters, additional research will be required to determine whether MD values in the splenium of the corpus callosum are associated with word recognition and word recall in a cohort speaking a phonetic language. Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates regional involvement in the disease process, demonstrates that the most predictable region for assessment of general cognitive function is parietal NAWM, and shows that MD values at the splenium of the corpus callosum are a useful biomarker for discriminating aMCI from AD. This work suggests that DTI measures may be important for monitoring the progression and the therapeutic effects of AD; however, validation in longitudinal and large cohort studies is warranted before our findings can achieve general acceptance.",

However, little is known about whether normal variation in vascular indicators may be related to changes in neural tissue integrity. Even less is known about how the brain is affected by cholesterol levels in the normal to moderate risk range, leading up to overt disease pathology. This study examined associations between serum lipid levels and DTI indicators of white matter (WM) structural integrity in a sample of 125 generally healthy older adults aged 43-87 years. Whole-brain voxelwise analysis, controlling for age and gender, revealed low density lipoprotein levels (LDL) as the most robust correlate of regional WM structural integrity of the measured lipids. Higher LDL was associated with decreased WM integrity in right frontal and temporal regions, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and internalexternal capsules. Increasing LDL was associated with increased radial and axial diffusivity; however, more widespread statistical effects were found for radial diffusivity. These findings suggest that normal interindividual variation in lipid levels is associated with compromised regional WM integrity, even in individuals below clinical thresholds for hyperlipidemia. Given the prevalence of cholesterol-associated sequelae in older adults, and mounting evidence suggesting a vascular role in the etiology of dementia, the current data suggest that",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Elevated serum cholesterol is a well-established risk factor for the development of cerebrovascular disease, and hypercholesteremia comprises one of the most common health concerns in our society affecting nearly 101 million Americans (Center for Disease Control). Understanding how variation in systemic lipids impacts the brain and ultimately quality of life in the elderly is therefore of high priority. It is estimated that 45 of the adult population has total cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mgdL, and that one third of the population maintains low-density lipoproteins (LDL) above 130 mgdL, demonstrating the high prevalence of individuals with increased risk for developing vascular related pathologies Lloyd-Jones et al., 2009.\nAlthough much research has aimed to understand how lipids contribute to the more major vascular pathologies, much less is known about how these lipids may contribute to neural health in the absence of high risk and overt damage.\nElevated cholesterol and conditions such as hypercholesteremia not only heightens the risk for stroke and cerebrovascular disease, but it is also associated with increased incidence of cognitive decline Breteler et al., 1994a;Solomon et al., 2009a;van Vliet et al., 2009, dementia Dufouil et al., 2005;Stewart et al., 2007, and Alzheimers disease (AD) Anstey et al., 2008;Kivipelto et al., 2002;Solomon et al., 2009b. In a recent epidemiological study, participants with moderately elevated total cholesterol (greater than 220 mgdL) were shown to have a significantly increased risk of developing AD three decades later Solomon et al., 2009b, suggesting that even mild to moderately high serum cholesterol may be predisposing individuals to disease pathology and that these effects may begin substantially earlier than the manifestation of clinical symptoms. It is therefore critical that a better understanding be gained of how even normal interindividual variation in lipid levels may affect brain tissue. It is possible that in addition to vascular effects, cholesterol may influence neural health via alternate mechanisms. For example, animal studies have supported this relationship between dietary cholesterol and neurodegenerative disease by linking consumption of a cholesterol rich diet to accumulation of beta-amyloid in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex, a pathological characteristic of AD Sparks et al., 1994. In humans, positron emission tomography findings of decreased glucose metabolism (indicating a reduction in neuronal activity) also correlate strongly with increasing levels of serum cholesterol in brain regions preferentially susceptible to AD pathology such as frontal and temporal areas Reiman et al., 2010.\nThere is mounting evidence implicating poor cerebrovascular health as a contributor to brain aging, and as risk factor for the development of dementias, including Alzheimers disease. For example, recent studies have demonstrated associations between brain tissue integrity and parameters associated with vascular health, such as blood pressure Kennedy and Raz, 2009;Leritz et al., 2010Leritz et al., , 2011. Understanding how cholesterol, another parameter known to influence vascular and neural health, impacts brain structure is also of primary interest. An early study that looked specifically at serum cholesterol utilized xenonenhanced computed tomography to demonstrate a longitudinal association between elevated levels of serum cholesterol and increasing volume of leuko-araiosis (white matter with altered signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging) in cognitively healthy older adults Meyer et al., 1999. Most recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become a valuable in vivo neuroimaging technique for examining subtle alterations in white matter tissue structure due to a range of developmental and degenerative conditions. Recent work utilizing DTI has demonstrated that interindividual variation in blood pressure is associated with white matter tissue structure, even in individuals within the low risk range Kennedy and Raz, 2009;Lee et al., 2009;Leritz et al., 2011Leritz et al., , 2010;;Segura et al., 2009. However, no known studies have specifically examined how serum cholesterol may influence white matter, particularly in populations below the threshold of significant clinical risk.\nAlthough concrete links between vascular health and dementia have been uncovered in epidemiological work, much less is known about the direct influence of risk parameters on brain tissue structure. The current study aimed to examine the association between interindividual variation in serum lipids and WM tissue structure as indexed by DTI, in a sample of neurologically healthy older adults. We examined the influence of total cholesterol (TOT), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides (TRIGLY) on brain structure with the prediction that there would be regional associations between cholesterol levels and tissue integrity in frontal brain regions most affected by aging Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2005 or alternatively, in regions affected by AD such as temporal and parietal areas Qiu et al., 2010;Salat et al., 2010. These predictions were based on prior literature suggesting that vascular risk factors primarily impact anterior brain regions Kennedy and Raz, 2009;Leritz et al., 2010;Raz et al., 2003;Salat et al., 2012, and on literature suggesting that high cholesterol may be associated with the development of AD Anstey et al., 2008;Kivipelto et al., 2002;Solomon et al., 2009b.",

Thirty-nine participants were obtained through a newsletter for the Harvard Cooperative Program on Aging (HCPA) Claude Pepper Older American Independence Center (OAIC) inviting participation from healthy, community-dwelling older African Americans. The remaining 86 participants were recruited through the Understanding Cerebrovascular and Alzheimers Risk in the Elderly (UCARE) program, an endeavor examining the relationship between cerebrovascular risk, brain structure, cognition, and risk of dementia. These subjects were recruited through the Boston University Alzheimers Disease Center (BUADC), dependent upon meeting the criteria of having at least one first-degree familial relative with a diagnosis of dementia. Exclusion criteria consisted of: a history of head trauma of mild severity or greater (e.g., loss of consciousness for greater than 10 minutes) according to the criteria of Fortuny and colleagues Fortuny et al., 1980, diagnosis of any form of dementia (i.e., Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia), any severe psychiatric illness, or any history of brain surgery. All participants were literate with at least a 6th grade education. One hundred-four participants claimed dominant right-handedness. They reported no impairments in cognitive or memory skills, and had Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Folstein et al., 1975 scores in the range of 23 to 30. Although three subjects were below the standard MMSE cutoff of 24, these scores are in a range outside of a dementia diagnosis, according to normative data based on the racial distribution of our sample Bohnstedt et al., 1994.

Next, the mean FA image was created by averaging all participants aligned FA volumes, and thinned to generate a mean FA skeleton, which represents the centers of all tracts common to the group. The mean skeleton image was masked to only display voxels with FA values greater than 0.2 to minimize the influence of partial voxel contamination. Each subjects aligned, common space FA data was then projected onto this skeleton to create a 4D skeletonized volume (3D skeletal volume by number of subjects), which was then utilized in voxelwise group statistics. Data along the skeleton were smoothed with an anatomical constraint to limit the smoothing to neighboring data within adjacent voxels along the skeleton.

Nearly all resulting clusters lateralized to the right hemisphere and were in the negative direction such that increasing LDL predicted lower FA values. The most robust associations occurred in frontal and temporal regions including portions of the anteriorsuperior corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and subcortical white matter subjacent to rostralcaudal middle frontal, precentral, middlesuperior temporal, and fusiform regions. Deeper subcortical pathways in the right hemisphere also evidenced significant associations including sections of the cerebral peduncle, fornix, external capsule, anteriorposterior limbs of the internal capsule, fornix, ventral diencephalon, and the posterior thalamic radiation. Few positive associations were evidenced, and these were isolated to the left hemisphere within the body of the corpus collosum, anterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule and white matter subjacent to lateralmedial orbitofrontal regions.\nIn addition, the contribution of LDL within the total cholesterol formula seemed to drive the relationship between FA and total cholesterol, such that 78 of voxels observed in the total cholesterol significance map overlapped with significant voxels in the LDL analysis. Significant regions that emerged in the total cholesterol analysis closely mimicked regions reported in the LDL analysis, although associations between total cholesterol and FA extended further along the right hemisphere anterior corona radiata, external capsule, and ventral diencephalon. Additional regions showing decreased FA as a function of increasing total cholesterol included white matter subjacent to the right hemisphere parahippocampal and fusiform cortices.\nNegative associations between HDL and FA were also mainly lateralized to the right hemisphere and included sections of the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the external capsule, thalamic pathways, frontal regions such as the anterior corona radiata, mediallateral orbitofrontal WM, and middlesuperior temporal WM. Bilateral significant effects were observed within the external capsule, and superior temporal WM, with additional left hemisphere regions of significance including the retrolenticular portion of the internal capsule and superior frontal WM. Small regions of HDL positively predicting increased FA emerged in isolated sections of the right posterior limb of the internal capsule and in white matter subjacent to the right hemisphere superior parietal cortex.\nOf the lipid measures, triglyceride levels revealed the fewest number of voxels showing significant associations with FA. Increasing triglyceride levels were correlated with decreased FA in portions of the middle cerebellar peduncle, genu of the corpus collosum, the brainstem and ventral diencephalon regions, along with bilateral effects in pre post central WM. Significant negative associations lateralized to the left hemisphere included small portions of the cerebral peduncle, posterior limb of the internal capsule, precuneus, and middle temporal WM. Triglyceride levels were positively associated with increased FA in portions of the left anterior corona radiata and superior parietal WM.\nTo compare the regional distribution of significant negative associations between FA and each of the individual lipid measures (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides), corrected significance maps from each lipid analyses were combined into a color-coded overlay displayed on a template T1 brain in Figure 3. Overall, LDL demonstrated the greatest volume of tissue showing statistically significant correlations with FA at the corrected P  0.05 threshold of the four lipid measures.\nAs LDL emerged as the most robust predictor of white matter tissue integrity as indexed by FA, Figure 4 demonstrates significant associations of LDL with each of the diffusion metrics (FA, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity). As previously indicated in Figure 2, increasing levels of LDL were most substantially correlated with reduced FA in right hemisphere temporal white matter, regions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the external capsule, as well as right hemisphere frontalcorticospinal areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and portions of the anterior cingulate (Fig. 4).

In general however, it appears that radial diffusivity qualitatively held greater associations with LDL in more anterior white matter regions, and axial diffusivity exhibited larger associations with LDL in posterior regions.\nSignificant clusters that remained after correcting for multiple comparisons on the linear model examining LDL and FA regressing the effects of age and gender (see FA results in Fig. 4) were assigned anatomical reference labels and deprojected into each subjects native diffusion space to extract mean FA values for each ROI. To assess whether potential confounding variables were influencing the relationship between LDL and FA, the original model (age, gender, and LDL as predictors of FA) was run with MABP, and lipid medication each independently added as predictors to determine if their inclusion significantly contributed to the model. We specifically examined the significance of the change in R 2 (Table III).\nResults of these statistical analyses indicate no significant group differences in mean FA between medication groups for all significant clusters and that adding lipid medication status into the model did not significantly account for variance already explained by the original predictive model comprised of LDL, age and gender. When MABP was added to the model, 4 of the 25 clusters showed a significant increase in model fit: Cluster1-RH Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus, R 2 Change ¼ 0.064, F Change(1,120) ¼ 9.663, P  0.01; Cluster7-RH Precentral WM, R 2 Change ¼ 0.052, F Change(1,120) ¼ 6.779, P ¼0.01); Cluster10-RH Caudal Middle Frontal WM, R 2 Change ¼ 0.036, F Change(1,120) ¼ 4.834, P  0.05; Clus-ter24-Precuneus WM, R 2 Change ¼ 0.055, F Change(1,120) ¼ 7.988, P  0.01. In our sample, MABP and LDL levels were not significantly correlated with one another r(123) ¼ À0.031, P ¼ 0.733. In addition, separate linear regression analyses were performed on each cluster to test for an interaction between LDL and lipid lowering medication status groups. These regressions did not reveal any significant interactions between medication groups for all clusters indicating that the slope of LDL and FA correlations were not statistically discernable between those on and off lipid lowering medication. Scatterplots showing the linear association between LDL and extracted mean FA and mean radial diffusivity values, labeled by lipid lowering medication status are presented in Figure 5 (mean FA was extracted from clusters of corrected significant voxels resulting from the linear regression model predicting FA from LDL, age, and gender).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The present study demonstrated a relationship between serum lipids, particularly LDL, and white matter tissue integrity. The significant linear fit between LDL and diffusion metrics in various brain regions suggests that correlated decrements in white matter structural integrity as a function of LDL can be evidenced across a range of lipid levels and such associations extend beyond those maintaining only severely elevated lipid levels. These results have two major implications. First, they demonstrate that peripheral markers of factors contributing to vascular health may provide information about neural health outside of the more obvious outcomes of CVD, such as stroke. Second, the results demonstrate that this relationship exists even in individuals within the normal range of serum lipid variation and that these effects remain unaffected by medication use, age or gender. The fact that these associations were observed even within ranges of LDL cholesterol levels that would be considered normal or mild is a unique finding and potentially suggests that subclinical risk may result in alterations to microstructure that possibly contribute to an increased vulnerability for developing further white matter degeneration and potentially cognitive decline later in life. Overall, these findings suggest that optimal management of lipids may need to be reconsidered with regard to neural health and provide clues about physiologic parameters that contribute to what has been a broad category of the effects of aging.",

    "Relationship of Serum Cholesterol to White Matter Microstructure": {
      "text": "Statistical maps of the relationship between LDL and FA showed the strongest associations out of the examined serum lipids, while TRIGLY and HDL revealed fewer significant correlations with diffusion metrics. In addition, LDL appeared to drive the relationship between TOT cholesterol and FA, with 78 of significant voxels in the TOT map directionally converging with the LDL map. As LDL represents about 60-70 of circulating serum cholesterol and is considered the major artherogenic lipoprotein (ATP III, 2002), the robust effects of LDL above other lipids measured in our analysis highlights the importance of monitoring all components of serum cholesterol and not relying solely on total cholesterol as indicative of health status. The predictive strength of LDL as a risk factor for vascular-based disease has been well documented in literature concerning coronary heart disease (CHD) and strategies aimed at decreasing levels of this specific lipoprotein in the population have been the primary initiative towards lowering CHD incidence for decades (ATP III, 2002). What is not well documented or understood is how serum lipid levels may be influencing brain structure up to the point of being considered at risk for health related insults. Our results indicating an association between decreasing white matter tissue integrity within a range of LDL variation further extends the potential benefit of reducing the number of individuals maintaining elevated levels of this modifiable risk factor in our society.\nIncreasing LDL levels were significantly associated with reduced FA in anterior and posterior regions (including frontal and temporal areas), as well as several deeper subcortical pathways. Regional effects of our findings somewhat coincide with recent work by Reiman and colleagues who demonstrated that glucose hypometabolism was associated with increasing serum cholesterol in frontal and temporal lobes within a sample of older adults maintaining lipid profiles comparable to our sample Reiman et al., 2010. Although our results revealed correlations between LDL and reduced FA in temporal and frontal regions, results were predominately lateralized to the right hemisphere. It may be the case that the normative range of lipids considered in this study can explain the lack of bilateral findings as perhaps regions become bilaterally involved only as serum cholesterol levels become more severe. Therefore, the range of lipid profiles examined in this study is possibly capturing only a snapshot along a more global trajectory of white matter damage associated with more severely elevated serum lipid levels. Alternatively, hemispheric differences in cerebral blood flow perfusion measures have been observed to show lateralized hypoperfusion within right middlesuperior frontal regions in clinical conditions such as AD and frontotemporal dementia, and our lateralized findings suggest the possibility that right hemisphere regions carry an increased vulnerability to microstructural damage that may be related to blood flow perfusion properties Du et al., 2006. However, this explanation of our lateralized findings is highly speculative as blood flow profusion properties were not assessed. Finally, it must also be considered that certain regions of significant associations between lipids and diffusion metrics observed in this study may possibly be consequential to voxels containing crossing fibers, or to changes of the shape of the tensors, both of which are an ongoing challenge in DTI research that hopefully will resolve as imaging methodology continues to improve. Recently, the mode of anisotropy has been introduced as a useful DTI parameter in determining voxels containing crossing fibers Douaud et al., 2011, and we plan to further investigate this measure in an upcoming manuscript focusing on multispectral signatures of white matter pathology related to cerebrovascular risk factors.\nThe associations between LDL and FA remained intact after controlling for age and gender, and did not exhibit a significant interaction based on lipid-lowering medication usage. Although some research has supported lipid-lowering agents (LLA) as protective against the development of dementia and AD Sabbagh et al., 2009;Solomon et al., 2009a, it has also been demonstrated that within individuals taking LLAs, only those who maintain lipid levels within the normal range show decreased odds for developing dementia Dufouil et al., 2005. Our findings did not reveal LLA usage to moderate the relationship between LDL and FA. A similar report examining a sample of healthy older adults within a range of lipids comparable to our study, found correlated decreases in cerebral glucose metabolism with elevating serum cholesterol, and these findings were also not moderated by LLA usage Reiman et al., 2010. However, the data presented may not be of sufficient design to determine effects of medication on brain tissue structure and more direct intervention would be of great interest for examining this question.\nOverall, regions showing reduced FA as a function of serum lipids were most strongly related to increases in radial (DR) compared to axial (DA) diffusivity. Increased radial diffusivity is believed to result from compromised myelin integrity, as opposed to increased axial diffusivity, which is thought to be indicative of axonal damage Figure 5. Scatterplots demonstrating the association between low density lipoprotein levels (LDL) and both mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean radial diffusivity (DR) within corrected significant clusters (P  0.05) resulting from the voxelwise analysis of FA by LDL (see Table III), labeled by lipid lowering medication status. Those currently taking lipid lowering agents are shown as red circles, and those not on any lipid modifying agents are shown as blue triangles. The mean fit regression line is shown in black, along with corresponding regression lines for each lipid medication group. The green vertical reference line depicts the cutoff between normal and moderately elevated LDL levels, and the orange vertical reference line depicts the cutoff between moderate and severe LDL levels.\nSong et al., 2002. However, this interpretation of radial and axial diffusivity has only been supported in singlefiber tracts, which can adequately be measured by diffusion tensor imaging. Regions comprised of more complicated underlying microstructure, such as voxels containing crossing fibers, make interpreting changes in DR and DA to anatomical correlates difficult Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani, 2009. DR has been previously proposed as a more sensitive measure than anisotropy for examining changes in white matter tissue structure in AD Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Salat et al., 2010;Stricker et al., 2009, and we found DR to be especially related to LDL cholesterol in temporal brain regions. Increasing indices of radial diffusivity suggesting compromised myelin integrity is an interesting finding, as cholesterol plays such a critical role in the molecular composition of myelin itself. Along this line, Bartzokis and colleagues have suggested a myelin model of AD pathology that draws upon genetic, molecular and cognitive evidence to argue myelination as the upstream variable leading to physiological changes observed in neurodegenerative disease Bartzokis, 2011. Our regional findings overlap with regions showing decreased tissue integrity in AD Salat et al., 2010, and taken together with the fact that cholesterol has been implicated in AD, it may be that associations between serum cholesterol levels and indices of WM microstructure are in part reflective of a similar process and pattern to how WM is affected in AD. Our findings are limited to a generally healthy population with no overt signs of dementia and any links to the degenerative patterns in AD would therefore be speculative.\nWhite matter regions demonstrating altered tissue integrity as a function of cholesterol are unique compared to previous work examining other components of vascular risk such as hypertension, which is perhaps the most studied vascular risk factor. Several prior studies have reported an association between hypertension and white matter lesions which typically occur in the periventricular regions Breteler et al., 1994b;Firbank et al., 2007;Raz et al., 2003 and our lab has previously found normal variation in blood pressure to be associated with decreased FA in the anterior but not posterior regions of the corpus collosum in a subset of the current sample of older adults, free from diagnosable cognitive deficits and overt CVD Leritz et al., 2010. More recently, our lab reported negative associations between MABP and white matter structural integrity within frontal, lateral parietal and precuneus white matter utilizing the sample reported in the current study. These effects remained after controlling for the presence of white matter lesions, and were observable in subsets limited to prehypertensive individuals, and those with controlled MABP due to medication usage Salat et al., 2012. Findings by Kennedy and Raz suggest that as the range of examined blood pressure becomes more severe, clinically diagnosed hypertension extends the deteriorative white matter effects of normal aging along an anterior to posterior gradient Kennedy and Raz, 2009.\nGiven the preferential impact of hypertension on anterior brain regions, the mechanism by which elevated blood pressure enhances the risk for developing neurodegenerative disease may be different than those associated with serum cholesterol. The differentiation of regional influences between MABP and serum lipids on white matter microstructure was supported by our results. MABP was a significant predictor of underlying white matter integrity in only 4 of 25 regions that showed a significant association between FA and LDL and were generally isolated to right hemisphere frontal areas (superior longitudinal fasciculus, caudal middle frontal, and precentral WM). Therefore, the majority of significant regional associations between LDL and FA existed outside of the influence of MABP, and extend posteriorly, and into deeper subcortical and temporal regions than may be expected from prior research capturing the effects of MABP on microstructure alone, thus supporting the idea that cholesterol may have unique effects on brain structure.",

    "Mechanisms Relating Serum Cholesterol to Brain Structure": {
      "text": "Although levels of circulating LDL appear to correlate with underlying WM tissue integrity, the mechanism relating serum cholesterol in the blood stream to structural alterations within the brain is uncertain. As serum lipids are too large to transverse the blood brain barrier, serum cholesterol is isolated from endogenously synthesized cerebral cholesterol by a selectively permeable membrane. Despite no direct transport of serum cholesterol across the blood brain barrier, cholesterol may undergo an oxidative process allowing the resultant serum-derived 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) and brain-derived 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), to freely diffuse into the brain driven by concentration gradients Babiker et al., 2005;Harik-Khan and Holmes, 1990. The proportional relationship between levels of these oxysterols, both in the serum and the brain, have previously been utilized as biomarkers for certain neurodegenerative disease including AD Bretillon et al., 2000b;Heverin et al., 2004, as well as possible indicators of cholesterol synthesis and metabolism in the brain, a processes critical for myelin maintenance and repair Bjorkhem, 2006;Bretillon et al., 2000a. Furthermore, oxysterols have been linked to structural alterations in the brain such as increased volume of T2-weighted brain lesions in multiple sclerosis Karrenbauer et al., 2006, and has been evidenced to influence the formation of amyloid B-peptides Brown et al., 2004, a pathological finding common in AD. Thus, the conversion of cholesterol to oxysterols provides a plausible mechanism linking serum cholesterol to brain structural integrity.\nMore directly, cholesterol potentially influences white matter integrity by promoting changes in vascular health via artherogenic properties, consequently restricting the flow of oxygenated arterial blood over time. Data available r Serum Cholesterol and DTI in Older Adults r r 1837 r as part of the Rotterdam study reveals that the risk of developing AD or vascular dementia is tripled in those who exhibit atherosclerosis Hofman et al., 1997. As atherosclerosis is considered a gradually developing condition in which plaque is accumulated over years leading to stenosis of arterial walls, it is possible that silent, underlying changes may be manifesting in brain structures long before the development of overt cognitive deficits de la Torre, 2004;Hofman et al., 1997. This buildup of plaque not only establishes LDL as the main risk factor for heart disease and stroke (American Heart Association), but excessive plaque accumulation in arteries supplying the brain could possibly initiate a cascade of effects detrimental to neuronal health such as cerebral hypoperfusion, damage to the blood brain barrier, and the occurrence of thrombosis leading to blockages of smaller capillaries. As microvasculature that supplies subcortical white matter regions are small in nature, they have been found especially vulnerable to ischemic insults Schmahmann et al., 2008.",

    "Limitations to the Study and Future Directions": {
      "text": "The results of the current study should be interpreted within the framework of its limitations. This is a cross-sectional study in a population in the generally healthy range without any diagnosable degenerative conditions, limiting the ability to make any definitive statements regarding causality. Longitudinal and interventional studies will help to clarify this issue, as well as to determine how LDL levels relate to the potential onset of overt cerebrovascular or cognitive symptoms such as dementia. It is important to comment on the potential generalizability of our results, given our sample. Individuals with a first-degree family history of dementia are at a slightly higher risk of developing dementia Huang et al., 2004, and higher levels of CVD risk factors are known to exist comorbidly in dementia and dementia risk Rosano et al., 2007. In addition, CVD risk factors are more widespread in African American communities Singh et al., 1998. Thus, our sample is somewhat biased in that it could contain higher prevalence of associations between CVD risk factors and brain structure. We conceptualize this as a strength, as it has allowed us to examine these relationships in the context of a potentially enriched sample. However, the degree to which we can generalize our findings to the overall population is uncertain. Despite potential limitations, this study shows that alterations to white matter are associated with serum lipid levels, even below the threshold of what is considered at risk for health related insults. Further research in this topic stands to heighten our present understanding of how modifiable physiological factors such as serum cholesterol influences neuronal health, and may provide new consideration to how we approach normative aging.",

    "CONCLUSIONS": {
      "text": "This investigation reveals that within a sample of cognitively healthy older adults, serum cholesterol levels are associated with reduced WM structural integrity and that these results are independent of age or gender, and not moderated by lipid-lowering medication usage. Of the serum cholesterols, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) exhibited the most robust associations with white matter integrity, while high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides revealed minimal correlations with tissue structure. Observed regions showing a decline in WM tissue integrity as a function of LDL, such as right hemisphere temporal and frontal regions, coincide with previous findings assessing correlations with cerebrovascular and AD risk. Recent work has begun to delineate the potential role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD Martins et al., 2009, and our findings support the plausibility of LDL contributing to a mechanism leading to alterations in brain tissue structure, particularly white matter integrity. Based on the normative range of lipid profiles in this study, observed declines in WM integrity may be seen even in subclinical ranges, highlighting the fact that as serum cholesterol is a modifiable risk factor, promoting healthy nutritional habits in an effort to dampen the observed effects on neuronal tissue structure may be a worthwhile strategy in preventing the onset and decreasing the prevalence of neurodegenerative disease in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the distribution of white matter (WM) disease in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and to evaluate the relative usefulness of WM and gray matter (GM) for distinguishing these conditions in vivo. Methods: Patients were classified as having FTLD (n ϭ 50) or AD (n ϭ 42) using autopsy-validated CSF values of total-tau:-amyloid (t-tau:A 1-42 ) ratios. Patients underwent WM diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric MRI of GM. We employed tract-specific analyses of WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and whole-brain GM density analyses. Individual patient classification was performed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with FA, GM, and a combination of the 2 modalities. Results: Regional FA and GM were significantly reduced in FTLD and AD relative to healthy seniors. Direct comparisons revealed significantly reduced FA in the corpus callosum in FTLD relative to AD. GM analyses revealed reductions in anterior temporal cortex for FTLD relative to AD, and in posterior cingulate and precuneus for AD relative to FTLD. ROC curves revealed that a multimodal combination of WM and GM provide optimal classification (area under the curve ϭ 0.938), with 87 sensitivity and 83 specificity. Conclusions: FTLD and AD have significant WM and GM defects. A combination of DTI and volumetric MRI modalities provides a quantitative method for distinguishing FTLD and AD in vivo.",

      "text": "Several biomarkers have been proposed to distinguish between frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) as entry criteria for disease-modifying treatment trials. Total-tau (t-tau), -amyloid (A 1-42 ), and other CSF analytes support in vivo diagnosis, with t-tau:A 1-42 ratio showing superior discriminating power in autopsy-confirmed studies. 123 However, CSF collection is invasive, costly, and limited in availability.\nStructural MRI of gray matter (GM) 456 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white matter (WM) 4 are less invasive and widely available candidate biomarkers. Autopsy-confirmed or CSFdefined investigations of FTLD and AD have demonstrated that GM MRI may be a useful biomarker. 4,7 FTLD is generally associated with anterior GM changes and AD with more posterior GM disease. Recent approaches extend these findings to classify individual patients. 4 -6,8 Few investigations have used DTI to evaluate WM disease in AD and FTLD. 4,9 -13 Group studies of DTI in clinically diagnosed FTLD have demonstrated significant WM disease in several tracts relative to healthy seniors, 12,13 although the distribution of disease may vary across clinical phenotypes. 9,10 In a comparative study of CSF-defined groups, reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in corpus callosum and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus was found in FTLD relative to AD. 4 The role of WM disease in the classification of FTLD and AD remains to be assessed.\nIn this article, we evaluate the distribution of WM and GM disease in CSF-defined cohorts of FTLD and AD. We then evaluate the relative contribution of WM and GM for the classification of individual patients.\nMETHODS Protocol approval, registration, and patient consent. All patients were recruited from the University of Pennsylvania Department of Neurology. Written informed consent was obtained for all patients and healthy seniors using a University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board-approved protocol.\nPatients. We analyzed scans from 130 participants. This included 92 patients who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture and also had volumetric T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) structural MRI and DTI scans. These patients were clinically diagnosed with AD (N ϭ 34) or an FTLD spectrum syndrome such as primary progressive aphasia (n ϭ 21), behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (n ϭ 27), or corticobasal syndrome (n ϭ 10). Clinical diagnosis was performed by a board-certified neurologist (M.G.) using published criteria. 14 -17 We additionally included healthy seniors (n ϭ 38) with volumetric T1 MPRAGE structural MRI and DTI scans. Table 1 summarizes demographic characteristics. Groups were matched across demographic characteristics, including age, education, and gender (all p Ͼ 0.10). Additionally, AD and FTLD groups were matched for disease duration ( p Ͼ 0.10).",

      "text": "A subset of patients (n ϭ 67; 38 FTLD, 29 AD) underwent neuropsychological examination using the Philadelphia Brief Assessment of Cognition (PBAC). 18 The PBAC is a brief, comprehensive, and validated dementia screening instrument that provides a subscale measure for 5 domains of cognition affected by dementia, including memory, visuospatial operations, language, executive control, and behavioralsocial comportment. The PBAC total score quantifies the presence and severity of dementia and is highly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). 18 The subset of patients who completed the PBAC were matched across AD and FTLD patient groups for demographic characteristics and were matched to the larger cohort of patients who underwent neuroimaging (all p Ͼ 0.10; table 1). Neuropsychological assessment was conducted within approximately 4 months of neuroimaging data collection and this duration did not differ between AD (mean Ϯ SEM ϭ 4.01 Ϯ 0.83 months) and FTLD mean Ϯ SEM ϭ 3.27 Ϯ 0.74 months; t(65) Ͻ1.",

      "text": "MRI evaluation for all patients with AD and FTLD, and analyzed in duplicate using either a sandwich ELISA or LUMINEX t-tau and A 1-42 levels, as described previously. 1,19 Patients were classified as AD or FTLD using an autopsy-validated t-tau: A 1-42 ratio cutoff of 0.34 (table 1). This cutoff revealed 100 sensitivity and 91 specificity for discriminating between AD and non-AD, 3 where t-tau:A 1-42 Ն0.34 was associated with AD and where t-tau:A 1-42 Ͻ0.34 was associated with non-AD. Throughout this article we assume that non-AD is consistent with FTLD pathology because of the phenotype diagnosis, consistent with our autopsy-validated CSF series.\nNeuroimaging acquisition. All participants underwent a structural T1-weighted MPRAGE MRI acquired from a SIEMENS 3.0 T Trio scanner with an 8-channel coil using the following parameters: repetition time ϭ 1,620 msec, echo time ϭ 3 msec, slice thickness ϭ 1.0 mm, flip angle ϭ 15, matrix ϭ 192 ϫ 256, and in-plane resolution ϭ 0.9 ϫ 0.9 mm. Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were acquired using a 30direction, single shot, spin-echo EPI sequence, with field of view ϭ 22 cm, matrix ϭ 96 ϫ 112, repetition time ϭ 6.5 s, echo time ϭ 99 msec, b value ϭ 0, 1,000 smm 2 ; 3 averages with total scan time ϭ 8 minutes for 72 ϫ 2-mm-thick slices with in-plane resolution ϭ 2 mm 2 .\nTract-specific analysis of diffusion tensor imaging. Diffusion tensor images (DTIs) were reconstructed from the DWIs using DTI-TK (http:dti-tk.sourceforge.net) and then analyzed using a previously reported tract-specific analysis (TSA) framework. 20 TSA involves 4 processing steps: segmentation of specific tracts on a template, modeling of each tract, normalization of the subjects DTs to the template space, and statistical analysis. We used a DTI template created from a population of aging adults (age 60 -80 years), using the publicly available IXI dataset (http:biomedic.doc.ic.ac.ukbrain-developmentindex. php?nϭMain.Datasets). Specific tracts were then segmented on this template by an expert, after whole-brain fiber tractography. 21 This approach takes advantage of prior knowledge of WM topology to separate tracts and minimizes interpretive confounds due to crossing fibers within a voxel. One central and 5 lateralized tracts were generated: a single corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral corticospinal (CST), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and uncinate fasciculus (UNC) tracts. The skeleton of each tract was approximated by a parametric surface using the continuous medial representation framework (cm-rep). 22 DTI images from all subjects were coregistered to the DTI template using a state-of-the-art tensor-based normalization technique. 23 Spatially normalized tensor fields were sampled for each subject along directions emanating from the tract skeleton to the tract boundary, and averaged, producing a single average tensor for each point on the parametric skeleton for each subject. FA values were derived from the average tensors, yielding scalar FA maps over 2-dimensional skeleton surfaces. Pointwise hypothesis testing with correction for multiple tests was performed on these maps using a nonparametric permutationbased cluster inference technique adapted to curved manifolds, with 1,000 permutations. We evaluated FA differences between each patient group relative to healthy seniors ( p Ͻ 0.001 cluster threshold). We also performed direct comparisons of FA differences between FTLD and AD and for these comparisons we used a more liberal threshold ( p Ͻ 0.01 cluster threshold) since there is reduced statistical power when comparing 2 disease groups relative to comparing a disease group and healthy group.",

    "GM density analysis.": {
      "text": "Whole-brain MRI volumes were preprocessed using PipeDream (https:sourceforge.netprojects neuropipedream) and Advanced Normalization Tools (http: www.picsl.upenn.eduANTS) using a previously reported procedure. 4 Briefly, PipeDream deforms each individual dataset into a standard local template space in a canonical stereotactic coordinate system. A diffeomorphic deformation was used for registration that is symmetric to minimize bias toward the reference space for computing the mappings, and topologypreserving to capture the large deformation necessary to aggregate images in a common space. These algorithms allow template-based priors to guide cortical segmentation and compute GM probability, which we use as a measure of GM density. Images were smoothed using a 4-mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.\nAnalyses were performed using FSLs randomize module (www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslrandomise). Group differences were evaluated using permutation-based methods with 1,000 permutationstest. For each patient group compared to healthy seniors, we report clusters that survive a q Ͻ 0.005 (false discovery rate FDR-corrected) threshold and contain a minimum of 400 adjacent voxels. For our direct comparison of AD and FTLD we report clusters that survive a q Ͻ 0.05 (FDR-corrected) threshold and contain a minimum of 400 adjacent voxels. The latter analysis corrected for multiple comparisons but used a more liberal threshold since there is reduced statistical power when comparing 2 disease groups relative to a disease group compared to a healthy group.\nClassification. We used ROC curves to classify each participant who had GM, DTI, and a neuropsychological evaluation as having FTLD or AD with 3 approaches. First, we used the mean FA of the anterior CC region that significantly differed in our DTI comparison of FTLD relative to AD (see below). Second, we used the mean GM density for the 3 cortical regions that differed in comparisons of FTLD and AD (see below). For each of these modalities we computed a logistic regression that generated a probabilistic likelihood of AD or FTLD diagnosis in each patient for each region. In each logistic regression we included a nuisance covariate for total PBAC score, a measure of disease severity, since we observed a group difference in this measure (see below). Third, we computed a backward stepwise logistic regression using all classifiers (1 DTI region, 3 GM regions, and 1 nuisance covariate for total PBAC) from the prior analyses to determine the optimal model for classifying AD and FTLD. Diffusion tensor imaging results. Patients with FTLD have significantly reduced FA relative to healthy seniors in all analyzed white matter tracts, including bilateral CST, IFO, ILF, SLF, and UNC as well as in CC (figure 1A, top). This is most prominent in anterior portions of these tracts. Patients with AD compared to healthy seniors have significantly reduced FA in bilateral CST, IFO, ILF, SLF, and right UNC and CC (figure 1B, top). A direct comparison between AD and FTLD revealed significantly reduced FA in anterior CC in FTLD relative to AD (figure 2A). Patients with AD did not show any areas of significantly reduced FA relative to FTLD. The location and size of significant clusters in each tract for each comparison are reported in table e-1 on the Neurology  Web site at www.neurology.org.",

      "text": "Patients with FTLD have significantly reduced GM throughout frontal and anterior temporal cortex relative to healthy seniors (figure 1A, bottom). Patients with AD have widespread GM atrophy relative to healthy seniors throughout parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex (figure 1B, bottom). A direct comparison of groups revealed significantly reduced GM in left anterior temporal cortex in FTLD relative to AD, and significantly reduced GM in the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus in AD relative to FTLD (figure 2B). Table e-2 summarizes the location and size of significant clusters for each group comparison.\nFTLD and AD patient classification. Table 2 shows that DTI provides a significant classifier (AUC ϭ 0.795; p Ͻ 0.001), with 79 sensitivity and 59 specificity for discriminating between AD and FTLD. The ROC curves are provided in figure 3. All 3 regions identified in the GM analyses achieved a significant AUC, ranging from 0.792 to 0.890. The posterior cingulate provided the highest GM-based classification accuracy, with 87 sensitivity and 66 specificity and the precuneus achieved modest specificity (82) and sensitivity (79). A backward stepwise regression revealed that a combination of GM and WM, with the addition of a nuisance covariate for total PBAC to control for disease severity, provides the best overall fit for predicting diagnosis DISCUSSION FTLD and AD can be difficult to discriminate in vivo due to often overlapping clinical features. Clinicopathologic correlation studies confirm that overlapping clinical phenotypes are associated with AD and FTLD spectrum pathology in multiple domains of cognition. 17,24,25 Corticobasal syndrome often due to FTLD spectrum pathology and posterior cortical atrophy often due to AD have overlapping visuospatial features; nonfluentagrammatic primary progressive aphasia associated with FTLD spectrum pathology and logopenic primary progressive aphasia associated with AD may have overlapping language difficulties; patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and patients with AD may present with behavioral difficulty, an executive disorder, or an episodic memory deficit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to im- prove diagnostic accuracy in a quantitative manner that does not rely on clinical features in order to screen patients for clinical trials involving diseasemodifying agents. While rare studies have described DTI in FTLD, 4,9 -12,26 we are unaware of previous work attempting to classify individuals with FTLD and AD on the basis of WM disease. Our findings suggest that both FTLD and AD have significantly reduced FA. Previous group studies have demonstrated WM changes in anterior brain regions in clinically diagnosed patients with FTLD. 9,111213 Our observation of reduced FA anteriorly is consistent with this body of work. Moreover, direct contrasts revealed that patients with FTLD have reduced FA relative to patients with AD in anterior CC, consistent with a previous comparative, whole-brain DTI analysis demonstrating reduced FA in this region in CSFdefined cohorts. 4 A few previous DTI studies have investigated the distribution of WM changes in patients with known disease defined by autopsy, CSF, or Pittsburgh compound B. 4,10 In the present study, all patients had CSF t-tau:A 1-42 that classified individuals as having AD or FTLD based on an autopsyvalidated sample. Thus, our findings are likely to reflect WM changes in patients with distinct underlying pathology.\nIt is noteworthy that all previous investigations, like ours, failed to observe reduced FA in AD relative to FTLD. 4,11,27 This includes a TSA study of CSFdefined FTLD and AD, 27 though this previous TSA report was limited by reduced DTI resolution (12 directions) and a smaller cohort of patients. FTLD may exhibit greater WM changes than AD due to prominent underlying neuropathology in FTLD that specifically involves microglia in FTLD-tau 28 and glial lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP. 29 WM pathology is much more modest in AD. This difference emphasizes the potentially important role that WM imaging may play in comparative studies distinguishing FTLD from AD. Indeed, our backward stepwise regression demonstrated that FA contributes significantly to the classification of FTLD and AD.\nOur classification results based solely on DTI may provide a sensitive (79) biomarker for distinguishing FTLD from AD, but DTI itself has modest specificity (59). One possibility is that separate assessments of axial and radial diffusivities that contribute to FA may improve specificity, as suggested in a previous study of primary progressive aphasia, 10 though the interpretation of these indices is highly controversial. 30 Previous work may have been somewhat limited in its ability to perform studies classifying individual patients in part because of the imaging analysis techniques. Prior studies thus relied on user-dependent techniques for defining a region or tract of interest, and potential variability in the definition of a tract inherent in user-dependent approaches, even among experts, limits the power of classification studies. We circumvented this problem while managing interpretive confounds associated with the directionality of crossing fibers by using a TSA approach. This userindependent analysis is based on a local WM ana- tomic atlas that automatically defines all tracts in a manner analogous to defining GM structures with voxel-based morphometry. Additional work is needed with this analytic technique in autopsydefined cases to validate tract definition. It is well-established that AD and FTLD have distinct patterns of GM defects 4,7 and our results are consistent with previous reports. However, few investigations have evaluated the relative usefulness of GM and WM for in vivo diagnosis of these 2 patient groups. We observed that GM regions compromised in AD provided better classification accuracy than WM, but that GM in the anterior temporal cortex for FTLD was a significant but weaker classifier. More advanced algorithms involving support vector machines have demonstrated higher classification accuracy for GM alone than our approach. 5,6 Other studies have used machine learning techniques to combine GM imaging with other neuroimaging modalities in order to distinguish AD from controls 31,32 and FTLD from AD, 4,8 and our results are consistent with their claims a multimodal approach yields higher classification accuracy compared to GM imaging alone. However, an advantage of the simpler approach in the present study is that it can easily be adapted for clinical evaluation of individual patients rather than a group-level machine learning analysis involving expert technical judgments.\nCritically, a multimodal approach that incorporates WM and GM provides an optimal classification method that is both sensitive and specific for discriminating between AD and FTLD. Classification measures with high sensitivity allow the clinician to detect the presence or absence of disease. However, specificity is also required to discriminate between diseases with distinct histopathologic characteristics. With the emergence of potential disease-modifying agents, comparative studies of this sort are important to establish specificity so that patients may be appropriately entered into etiologically specific clinical trials.\nThere is growing evidence that there are at least 3 subtypes of underlying pathology associated with FTLD, including tau-positive inclusions (FTLDtau), TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP), and less commonly associated with the fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). 33 The multimodal approach in this article measured classification accuracy using CSF t-tau:A 1-42 , which has been reported as sensitive and specific for discriminating between AD and non-AD 3 and we assume that phenotypes associated with the latter are related to FTLD pathology. T-tau: A 1-42 is not, however, sensitive for discriminating between pathologic subtypes of FTLD, and future work is required to identify candidate CSF biomark-ers for further discriminating between these subgroups of FTLD. 34 We conclude that individuals with AD and FTLD have significant changes in WM and GM that appear to reflect distinct underlying neuropathologic processes with reasonably high accuracy. This multimodal approach supports noninvasive classification of individual patients with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in a clinical setting.",

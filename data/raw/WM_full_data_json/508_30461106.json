    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ventricular enlargement in elderly raises a challenging differential diagnosis to physicians. While Alzheimers disease is the most common form of dementia, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) constitutes a potentially reversible syndrome. iNPH has a unique pathophysiology pertaining to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and periventricular white matter. We aimed to determine the effects of iNPH on periventricular white matter bundles and to further characterize its ventricular and sulcal CSF distribution by using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) and CSF volumetrics on high resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data. METHODS: Deterministic DTT and validated volumetric parcellation were performed on 20 healthy elderly, 13 Alzheimers disease (AD), and 9 iNPH patients. The superior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, and dentatorubrothalamic tract were traced and quantified using DTI studio software. Cloud-based volumetric parcellation was also performed on 138 healthy subjects across the lifespan, 13 AD, and 9 iNPH-patients. Ventricular and sulcal CSF volumes in the three groups were compared. RESULTS: Combining increased mean diffusivity of the superior thalamic radiation with ventricular volume resulted in clear separation of iNPH from the AD and age-matched healthy subject groups. Additionally, ventricular to sulcal CSF ratio, utilizing fully automated methods, was significantly greater in the iNPH patients compared to AD and healthy age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Combined microstructural (DTT) and macrostructural (ventricular volume) changes is a promising radiological approach in studying ventriculomegaly. Automated estimation of the disproportionate ventricular and sulcal CSF ratio in patients presenting with ventriculomegaly may be important as radiologic markers in differentiating iNPH from other causes of ventriculomegaly.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Ventriculomegaly is a challenging neuroimaging finding neurologists frequently face in the aging population. 1 Hydrocephalus is a general term that indicates accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system due to imbalance in the production, drainage, or reabsorption of CSF resulting in dilation of the cerebral ventricles. 2 It is classified into obstructive versus nonobstructive and communicating versus noncommunicating hydrocephalus based on the presence or absence of an identifiable near blockage of the CSF flow and at the location of this near blockage when present, respectively. 2 If the increase in the ventricular volume (VV) is due to cerebral atrophy secondary to gray or white matter (WM) volume loss, it is called hydrocephalus ex vacuo. 1 Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus that results in a treatable syndrome characterized by the triad of gait impairment, progressive dementia, and urinary incontinence. 3,4 iNPH prevalence is estimated to be 21.9 of 100,000 and increases with age, with an incidence of approximately 5.5 of 100,000 per year. 5 Other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers, vascular dementia, and Parkinsons diseases, are also common in the same age population. Studies have shown coexistence of increased rate of Alzheimers disease (AD) histopathology in patients with iNPH beyond what can be accounted for by chance alone. 6,7 Studies have shown decrease CSF production and turnover in both\nC 2018 by the American Society of Neuroimaging 1 AD and NPH. 8 It was postulated by Silverberg that failure of CSF production or increased CSF flow resistance might lead to either AD, iNPH, or AD-NPH depending on which pathological process predominates. 9 More recent data showed delayed clearance of the CSF from the entorhinal cortex in iNPH patients suggesting involvement of the glymphatic system in the pathophysiology of iNPH. 101112 Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of iNPH carries an importance beyond iNPH itself, as it relates to the brain CSF hydrodynamics relationship and pertains to questions regarding aging and Alzheimers disease pathophysiology.\nAccording to both the International and the Japanese iNPH guidelines, 2,4 the diagnosis of iNPH is suspected based on the combination of clinical evaluation and neuroimaging and is confirmed based on the response to an invasive procedure such as CSF tap test or external CSF drain. 5 Therefore, the complexity of ventriculomegaly and particularly iNPH diagnosis and management appears to be multifactorial. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has shown to offer a useful in vivo surrogate biomarkers of WM changes in AD, 13,14 ventriculomegaly, 15 and iNPH. 16,17 Previous studies using deterministic and probabilistic DTI techniques revealed various profiles of DTI changes in different regions of the periventricular WM when compared to normal and disease controls. 16,17 A consensus is still not established for the most sensitive and specific DTI measurements in distinguishing ventriculomegaly in iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases.\nNeuroimaging noninvasive markers for iNPH are a critical need, we propose a new technique to differentiate NPH from healthy and disease controls using novel MRI-DTI targets. In this study, we provide quantitative DTI mapping of main WM pathways neighboring the lateral ventricular system. We analyzed the effect of iNPH on the superior thalamic radiation (STR) as it courses adjacent to the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle. The corticospinal tract (CST) and the dentatorubro thalamic tract (DRTT). Moreover, we investigated the volumetric changes of the ventricular and sulcal CSF in AD, iNPH, and healthy aging subjects across lifespan.",

      "text": "We included 13 single-center Alzheimers patients (7 females and 6 males, age range  65-87 years, mean  73 years, standard deviation  6.9 years), 9 iNPH patients (5 females and 4 males, age range  61-91 years, mean  77.2 years, standard deviation  8.6 years), and 20 normal healthy adults (11 females and 9 males, age range  62-85 years, mean  75 years, standard deviation  7.1 years) in our analysis. Twenty healthy patients were the elderly subset of 138 patients subjects imaged across lifespan (57 males and 81 males, age range  5-85 years, mean  35.5 years, standard deviation  20.4 years). The AD patient data were collected by the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org, full eligibility criteria for the ADNI are described in the ADNI2 procedures manual (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2008). The healthy group DTI was acquired from the International Neuroimaging Data Sharing Initiative (INDI) online database (https:fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.orgindipronki.html). Additional variables included subjects age. This sample was provided by the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI, NY) as part of the original NKI-Rockland sample. All necessary approvals and procedures for human subject studies were followed as required by ADNI and NKI. The iNPH patients were enrolled in the study following University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Institutional Review Board approval and diagnosed with probable iNPH per the International iNPH guidelines. 4 The iNPH patients were followed by a dementia specialist over time and iNPH diagnoses confirmed with serial lumbar puncture tap test. All iNPH patients had Evans index .3, calculated on the axial view by dividing the largest width of the frontal horns by the largest width of the skull. 16 Patients were medically stable at the time of the assessments. Three out of the nine patients had positive Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoidspace Hydrocephalus (DESH) sign on coronal cuts of their initial MRI. 5 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was done on the initial evaluation as a cognitive screen (see Table 1 for clinical characteristics and demographics of the iNPH patients).",

The MRI protocol included (1) 3dimensional (3D) fluid attenuated inversion recovery and 3D T2-weighted and 3D spoiled gradient echo (T1-weighed) data, field of view  256  256 mm (isotropic voxel size  1 mm); and (2). Diffusion-weighted data using a single-shot, spin-echo diffusion sensitized echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the balanced Icosa21-encoding scheme, 18,19 a diffusion sensitization of b  1,000 smm 2 , and repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs) of 7,900 ms and 70 ms, respectively. EPI distortion artifacts and scan time were reduced by using a SENSE acceleration factor (R) or k-space under sampling equals to 2 (ie, R  2). 192021 The slice thickness was 3 mm with 48 axial slices covering the entire brain, foramen magnum to vertex, a square field of view (FOV)  256  256 mm 2 , and an image matrix of 256  256. The average number of nondiffusion-weighted or b ß 0 magnitude image was 8. The total DTI acquisition time was approximately 7 min and resulted in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-independent DTI metric estimation. 22 The healthy NKI group DTI images were acquired using a 3.0 T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) with a spin echo-EPI factor  128, TETR  9110,000 ms, FOV  256 mm, spatial resolution  2.0  2.0  2.0 mm, 64 diffusion encoding gradients, b value  1,000 smm 2 , and 12 nondiffusion volumes. Further details about the study image acquisition protocol are available on the INDI website as provided above. These data have been made available to all researchers around the world for the purpose of discovery science and potentially for replication of results in different laboratories. The ADNI cohort MRI, standard MRI, dMRI, and clinical data were downloaded from the publicly available ADNI database (www.loni.usc.eduADNI). Whole-brain MRI data were acquired using a Siemens Verio 3T system-gradient coils capable of 45 mTm and 200 Tms slew rate-with a 32channel phased-array head-coil. Diffusion volumes were acquired using a standard twice-refocused, single-shot EPI pulse sequence: TRTE  567,200 ms; matrix  116  116; 80 contiguous slices; voxel size: 2  2 2 mm 3 ; number of b ß 0 volumes  7; b factor  1,000 at 48 uniformly distributed diffusion encoding orientations, bandwidth of Hzpixel, and echo spacing of .68 ms. In order to assure the quality of DTI data, regional and global gray matter, white matter and CSF fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) histograms were evaluated. Voxel size, b factor calibration and signal-tonoise ratio on b0, and diffusion-weighted images were deemed acceptable on all protocols to enable DTI-based tissue segmentation using FA and MD (see Fig 1). In an attempt to prevent type I error, we computed false discovery rate (FDR) by using the Benjamini-Hochberg method as described in detail elsewhere to adjust for multiple comparisons. 23 We calculated adjusted P values derived from P values of all the correlation analyses between diffusion tensor parameters correlation and lateral ventricles in subjects with iNPH, AD, and healthy subjects, and comparison analyses of ventricular and sulcal subarachnoid CSF among the aforementioned subject groups to determine which values from the data remain significant at an FDR of .10.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of deterministic fiber tractography analysis of the periventricular WM disease in iNPH. The STR, for the first time in iNPH patients, was traced and evaluated using the methods and protocols discussed above. The STR forms the most medial part of the superior corona radiata and runs medial to the CST. 26 We hypothesized that the STR will be affected by iNPH ventriculomegaly given its anatomical proximity to and its pattern of spread around the lateral ventricle wall (see STR tracking in Fig 2). In this study, we attempt to combine the dynamic interplay between the microstructural changes in the periventricular WM with the macrostructural characteristics of ventriculomegaly in iNPH. By combining these two measures we demonstrate the feasibility of differentiating the groups of interest based on two-dimension vector representation of pathology (see Fig 4). Combining both the VV and STR MD led to group separation of iNPH, AD, and HE. This demonstrates that while the separation of AD from healthy elderly was driven solely by the increased VV, the separation of iNPH group from the other two groups was driven not only by the ventricular size but also by the accompanying increase in the tracts MD. The increase in VV was associated with increase in the MD, driven mainly by changes in the axial diffusivity. The relationship between MD and VV describes a 2-dimensional marker of iNPH that separates it clearly from the AD and age-matched healthy controls. This radiographic marker may reflect the in vivo interaction between ventriculomegaly and WM changes. Combining volumetric and DTI led to an increase in the difference between the groups capturing the changes in iNPH by addressing both the increased ventricular size, as well as the increased diffusivity in the periventricular WM.\nSeveral quantitative and volumetric techniques have been proposed and used in the diagnoses of iNPH. Evans index and DESH are already being used as a part of the diagnostic criteria of iNPH. 4,5 More automatic techniques have been studied; Tsunoda and coauthors measured the VV over the ICV ratio in iNPH, cerebrovascular disease patient, and HE and found that most iNPH had a VVICV ratio above 30 while none of the control subjects had a ratio above 30. 19 VV reported as 49.9  25.3 mL in AD using semiautomatic segmentation software. 14 One of the radiological signs of iNPH is hydrocephalus out of proportion to the cortical atrophy. 20 We adopted a novel validated and fully automated quantitative volumetric approach to calculate the ventricular and sulcal CSF components. By analyzing the total sulcal and the sylvian sulcal CSF, we found that the mean sulcal CSF was greater in the AD cohort than the iNPH, however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. This might be driven by the sylvian sulcal CSF volume as it was statistically significantly higher in the iNPH group compared to the AD group. This finding is in line with the previous observation of the DESH sign, enlarged sylvian fissure, and tight high convexities. 5 Follow-up quantitative sulcal CSF distribution studies on a larger scale might prove this technique to be promising in quantifying and detecting subtle changes in early stages of iNPH, particularly with the rising evidence of MRI changes years before the onset of iNPH symptoms. 21 While the total sCSFV of iNPH was comparable and not significantly different from the sCSFV in Alzheimers and age-matched HE across lifespan. The vCSFVs of iNPH were significantly greater than AD and age-matched control. If the ventriculomegaly was due to a neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia, we would expect cortical atrophy and, therefore, increase in the sulcal CSF volume to be proportionate to the ventriculomegaly. Interestingly, however, the sulcal CSF volume of the iNPH patients was comparable to the AD and the HE. This provides a noninvasive radiological method to evaluate ventriculomegaly, an increase VV that is disproportionate to the cerebral cortical atrophy. In this study, we found the vCSFsCSF ratio to be significantly higher in the iNPH patients when compared to AD and HE. In our study, the colossal angle less than or equal to 90 ࢪ and effacement of the sulci at the brain vertex along with disproportionate ventriculomegaly in respect to the brain parenchymal volume loss were predictive of the NPH in more than 70 of the time when blinded reviewers were exposed to the mix of the AD, NPH, and HE subjects. Adding the described noninvasive imaging biomarkers will increase the PPV to above 95. However, this needs to be further evaluated by larger number of subjects in the future studies.\nThe effect of iNPH on many WM tracts have been previously explored using variety of DTI techniques. Increased MDs in the periventricular WM have been reported using voxel-based analysis, 27 tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), 28,29 and ROI analysis. 30,31 This increase in the MDs may increased diffusion of extracellular water molecules in the major projection bundles near the ventricular system in with iNPH. 32 iNPH effect on FA value of surrounding WM pathways is more heterogeneous across the studies. Reduced FA in the centrum semiovale and increased in the internal capsule was reported in one study using TBSS. 28 ROI-based analyses showed that FA values of the CST were increased in iNPH patients compared to healthy controls in one study 30 and decreased in another compared to normal controls and Parkinsons disease patients. 31,33 It was proposed that the increased FA value of the CST is mainly due to increase in axial diffusivity and hypothesized that the stretching and compression effect of the enlarging ventricles leads to reduced tortuosity and increased coherence of the WM tracts leads to increased diffusivity of water parallel to these fibers. 28 Additionally, axonal damage and degeneration of the crossing fibers were thought to be playing an additional role in the increased FA values in the CST. Recently, Kamiya and coauthors studied postsurgical shunting axonal stretching and recovery of the CST using multishell and higher b factor DWI using the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model and WM tract integrity, and found that the orientational coherence within the CST was higher in patients compared to controls, and some normalization happened after the shunt surgery in patients. 34 It is unclear why there is asymmetry between the right and left sides in our iNPH cohort. On visual inspections of ventriculomegaly on axial imaging (see Fig 3), 3 patients had larger left lateral ventricles. This could be due to our small sample size and will need testing in larger studies. Additionally, our data does not explain why patients were present with different phenotypes. But, one could speculate that from the clinical standpoint, patients who have cognitive and gait abnormalities might have slightly different disease process than the ones who have urinary incontinence and gait abnormalities.",

We did not compare the differences in DTI-derived scalar measures of the periventricular WM tracts among the three groups as DTI data were acquired using different protocols and more studies are needed under unified MRI protocols. No quantitative assessment of test-retest reliability for the fiber tracking of WM tracts was performed, DTI quality assurance was evaluated by inspecting regional FA and MD histograms as discussed in the Methods section. We avoided FA interpretation as differences might reflect nonspecific multidirectional changes in water diffusivity secondary to the different MRI protocols. The unidirectional measures of axial, radial, and the MD are considered to be more comparable across different MRI protocols. 35 Further larger scale studies using larger sample size and unified MRI protocols are needed.",

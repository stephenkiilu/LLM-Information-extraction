    "BACKGROUND": {
      "text": "Emerging data have shown that cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)\nwas the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). 123 VCID is estimated to be the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimers disease (AD), with major deficits in executive function (EF), attention, memory, language, and information processing, that can seriously affect the activities of daily living of patients. 4 As with AD, the incident and severity of VCID are recognized as an urgent public health crisis. 1 Several mechanisms have been proposed to link cSVD to cognitive impairment, including bloodbrain barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral blood flow decreases, vascular gray matter and white matter (WM) injuries, oxidative stress, and inflammation. 3 The glymphatic system (GS) is a discovered putative clearance pathway within the central nervous system (CNS), which facilitates the clearance of the waste solute from the brain via the interstitial fluid (ISF)-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exchange, maintaining cerebral homeostasis. 5 GS dysfunction was thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and probable etiology of cSVD as well as VCID. 678 However, how changes in GS affect the cognitive function in cSVD is still poorly understood.\nThe diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) is an approach to calculate the differences of the water diffusivity in the WM fiber tracts (projection and association fibers) between that in the direction of parallel and perpendicular to the perivascular space (PVS) around the medullary veins at the level of lateral ventricle body. 9 This approach hypothesizes that histological changes in the projection and association fibers may be attributable to pathology involving the PVS. 9 Due to its noninvasive and rather simple nature, DTI-ALPS approach is currently gaining growing attention and has expanded its application in a variety of diseases and conditions. 9 It has shown favorable cross-vendor test-retest repeatability in a number of large sample cohorts. 101112 Lower DTI-ALPS index indicates that free water (FW) movement in the PVS direction is not dominant, which has been reported to be associated with impairment of glymphatic clearance function in cSVD patients 13,14 and shown to be independently related to VCID. 7,15,16 Another DTI-based FW index was recently proposed to enable the extraction of the extracellular water content from the tissue compartment using post-processing techniques. 17 FW measured in the WM tissue (WM-FW) has been found to be strongly associated with cognitive status. Specifically, high WM-FW is associated with vascular risk factors (VRFs) and has been linked to a decline in episodic memory (EM) and EF in older individuals. 18,19 In the present study, we hypothesized that lower ALPS index indicated the dysfunction of glymphatic clearance that would result in the accumulation of FW content in the extracellular space, leading to cognitive decline in EF. Using four cohorts including middle-aged to older individuals with racial and ethnic diversities, we first examined the associations between the ALPS index and EF performance, and then investigated the role of WM-FW as a potential mediator of the relationship between ALPS index and EF performance.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Our study provides strong evidence that the ALPS index is independently associated with UDS3-EF scores, after adjusting for demographics, VRFs, and classical cSVD markers, and that WM-FW mediates this association in four independent middle-to-aged cohorts with racial and ethnic diversities. In addition, because WM microstructural integrity (MD, FA) and WM radial asymmetry pattern (λ2λ3) have been reported to bias the ALPS index and be associated with cognitive impairment, 303132 we added these two confounders to the regression models and found the association between ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores and the mediation effects of WM-FW remained significant in the MarkVCID cohort, suggesting that microstructural integrity and radial asymmetry pattern of WM fibers did not have much impact on the results. All the above findings extend our previous results showing the Animal and human studies have demonstrated that glymphatic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology and etiology of cSVD and VCID. 2,7,8,33,34 GS has been proposed as a fluid clearance pathway in CNS. When GS is impaired, waste substances, such as amyloidbeta (Aβ) and tau will be accumulated, leading to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. 35 In addition, GS carries immune cells and inflammatory factors. Dysfunction of GS might result in neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. 36,37 Furthermore, cSVD contributed to arterial pulsation alterations and AQP4 water channel dislocation, which influences CSF influx of GS that could exacerbate Aβ deposition and cognitive decline. 8,33,38 DTI-ALPS approach is based on the assumption that the glymphatic efflux pathway (perivenous space) runs in the same direction as the medullary veins at the lateral ventricle body level. 9 ALPS index measures the water diffusion capacity along the PVS surrounding the medullary veins, which could reflect part of the glymphatic clearance function (ISF drainage from the WM area) to some extent. A previous study compared the DTI-ALPS method with the gold standard of glymphatic MRI with intrathecal administration of gadolinium and provided the evidence that ALPS index has a good consistency with the glymphatic clearance function. 13 Several studies have demonstrated that a lower ALPS index was related to radiological features and cognitive decline in cSVD patients. 7,13,15,16,39 In this study, we focused on EF, which manifests as the impaired capacity to use complex information, formulate strategies, and exercise self-control.\nEF is among the first cognitive domains to decline with aging 40 and is a prominent cognitive phenotype of cSVD in which less pronounced EM deficits are present compared to AD patients. 41 Our results showed that the reduced ALPS index was independently associated with the poorer EF in four cohorts of adult and older individuals, suggesting a close relationship between the impairment of ISF drainage and cognitive decline in individuals at risk for cSVD, which is in line with previous studies.\nPrevious human studies have evidenced that larger DTI-derived metrics of WM integrity were independently associated with lower EF in cSVD patients. 424344 However, DTI-derived metrics were currently thought to be likely contaminated by extracellular water. 17 The FW model, which consists of a FW compartment and a tissue compartment, was proposed to study diffusion changes in WM more accurately. 17,45 The FW compartment represents water molecules that are not restricted or oriented, which can be used as an imaging marker for an ISF fraction. 19 Of importance, numerous recent studies demonstrated that higher WM-FW was strongly associated with cognitive decline in older adults as well as individuals with MCI and AD. 19,464748 A recent study reported a significant negative association between WM-FW and EF with a processing speed component, specifically in the fornix and the corpus callosum in a cohort of community-dwelling subjects. 46 This study underlined the dominant role of WM-FW as a determinant of EF with a processing speed component, as compared to the WM fiber microstructure integrity. 46 Our previous work has reported a negative relationship between WM-FW and UDS3-EF scores in six independent cohorts, including MarkVCID, UCD_ADRC, UCSF_MAC, and FHS cohorts. 18 In the present study, we further detected that WM-FW significantly mediated the relationship between ALPS index and UDS3-EF scores in the same cohorts. Our observations on the association between the ALPS index and WM-FW suggest a plausible underlying biological mechanism that might involve GS. Lower ALPS index, which indicates the impediment of ISF drainage along the PVS, thus leading to an increase in ISF fraction and WM-FW. It is worth noting that, we utilized single-shell acquisition of DTI data for FW reconstruction in the present study, which requires model simplifications and regularization and, therefore, is sensitive to the initialization parameters and may not distinguish between FW and MD alterations. 49,50 The Multishell approach requires nonlinear minimization techniques with a high computational burden, but can lead to a more robust fit, which can be considered to enhance the accuracy of FW calculation in our future studies.\nIn this study, we noticed that theres a direct effect of ALPS index on UDS3-EF scores in UCSF_MAC and FHS cohorts in addition to the mediation effect of WM-FW. This variation of mediation effect between UCSF_MAC and FHS cohorts and other cohorts might be due to (1) Difference in racialethnicity: compared to other cohorts, UCSF_MAC and FHS cohorts have a higher percentage of NHW subjects and FHS cohorts showed better EF performance. Previous studies have reported the influence of racial and ethnic disparity on cognition in older adults and AD patients and demonstrated NHW subjects presented less cognitive decline than Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) subjects. 51,52 (2) Difference in DTI acquisition parameters and scanner: the voxel size of DTI images in the FHS cohort was different from that in other cohorts (non-isotropic) and part of the DTI data was acquired by the 1.5T MR scanner, which might affect the ALPS index calculation.\n(3) Difference in baseline cSVD burden: although WMH burden has been considered in this study, other cSVD markers, for example, lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), were not collected and included in the analysis. Further studies should take it into account.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the mediation role of WM-FW on the relationship between ALPS index and EF in a large sample of middle to aged subjects at risk for cSVD.\nAlthough ALPS index was regarded as a surrogate marker of glymphatic clearance function in a couple of previous clinical studies, 53545556 DTI-ALPS method itself has some limitations when interpreting the relationship between ALPS index and the glymphatic function, including (1) ALPS index indicates the capacity of water diffusivity along the direction of PVS, not within the PVS. 57 (2) Placed ROIs for calculating the ALPS index, which may also be affected by partial volume effects of other sources of directional water motion, for example, other fiber tracts, or confounding factors, for example, patients motion, blood flow. 57,58 (3) DTI-ALPS method only evaluates the area outside the lateral ventricle body and cannot evaluate perivascular diffusivity in other regions where the PVS does not run in the x-, y-, z-axis directions. 57 While GS has been confirmed to involve various brain regions, 33 to what extent the ALPS index indicates the whole brain glymphatic function is a subject of active debate. 59 In this study, we further investigated the PVS volume fraction in normal-appearing WM and basal ganglia (nawmPVSVF and bgPVSVF, respectively), which is one of the key surrogate markers of ISF drainage and glymphatic function, but we did not detect similar mediation effect of PVSVF on the associations between ALPS index and EF scores to that of WM-FW In conclusion, our findings suggest that, in middle-aged to aged individuals, a lower ALPS index, which may be a surrogate marker of glymphatic dysfunction, is strongly associated with EF and that this association is mediated by the ISF drainage in WM. The findings provide a strong clinical rationale for the use of ALPS index as a marker of cognitive function in multi-site observational studies and clinical trials to monitor and prevent VCID.",

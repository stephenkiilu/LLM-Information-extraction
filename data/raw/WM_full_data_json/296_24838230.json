    "abstract": "Background -Previous studies have shown that white matter lesions (WMLs) is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. Objective -We tested the hypothesis that the cognitive impairments associated with periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be mediated by the cortical thinning of corresponding area. Method -Sixteen stroke-and dementia-free subjects with PWMHs and 16 healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent an examination of cognition, MRI-based cortical thickness measurement and a MRI-DTI scan. Then, the possible relationships among cognitive impairments, PWMHs and the topography of cortical thinning were analyzed. Results -Comparing with the controls, the cognitive tests of the subjects with PWMHs showed significant decline in the domains of verbal fluency and executive function. After accounting for age, gender, years of education, and treatable vascular risk factors related to cognitive performance, cortical thickness had an independent influence on the cognitive impairments, especially in the frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, superior and middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyrus, insula, and cuneus. Conclusions -Our results suggest that the association between PWMHs and cognitive impairments is mediated by cortical thinning.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are commonly observed on MRI scans of elderly people, have been found to increase in prevalence and severity with age (1). They are associated with cognitive dysfunction in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and have recently been identified as a risk factor for dementia (2).\nAlthough WMHs may tend to be associated with cognition decline, the independent associations of periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMHs) with cognition are inconsistent among studies. In a longitudinal cohort study of normal elderly subjects, PWMHs were associated with the level of cognitive impairment (3), whereas some other studies indicated that PWMHs are not associated with levels of cognitive decline when cortical volume loss is accounted for (4). Therefore, some researchers presumed that the correlation between cognitive impairment and PWMHs is mediated by cortical atrophy.\nHowever, the previous analyses regarding the association of PWMHs or cortical thickness with cognitive function have not excluded the possible impacts of other types of WMHs. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the association of PWMHs and cortical volume loss with cognitive impairments in the subjects with pure PWMHs.\nConventional structural MRI techniques, such as T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, provide little information about the severity of the underlying pathological changes in (5). Diffusion tension image (DTI) is a quantitative MRI technique that measures the directionality and mobility of water diffusion in tissue and provides increased sensitivity to detect the structural integrity of white matter fibers (6). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a measurement of the diffusion consistency in all direction (7).\nThe present study evaluated PWMHS with magnetic resonance DTI, the topography of cortical thickness with surface-based morphometry, and cognitive impairments with neuropsychological tests in the stroke-and dementia-free subjects. The relationships among these variables are evaluated to further clarify the association of PWMHs and cortical thinning with cognitive impairments.",

All of them were clients who accepted regular health checks in the health examination center in Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University and voluntarily participated into this study. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital, and all participants gave their informed consent. All participants were required to be within the age range of 50-75 years and underwent a comprehensive clinical examination by two experienced neurologists, including medical history, physical, and neurological assessments. Subjects PWMHS were evaluated with conventional structural MRI techniques, including T1-weighted, T2weighted, and FLAIR images. Periventricular regions were defined as regions between 3 and 13 mm from the ventricular surface (7). No participants had the disorders that might have confounded their current cognitive state, such as metabolic encephalopathy, thyroid disease, or syphilis, No participants had current or past somatic, psychiatric, or neurological disorders that might have caused the cognitive impairment, such as stroke, schizophrenia, epilepsy, severe head trauma, encephalitis, brain tumors, alcohol abuse, severe depression, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease. Control subjects, matched with the PWMHS subjects for age, gender, degree of education, and vascular risk factors, showed no WMH on MRI imaging, no neurological disorders, and no any deficits on the neuropsychological test battery.",

First, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and color-coded directionality maps of diffusion were created in individual images. The color-coded directional maps provided easy visualization of the white matter fiber tracts. Brickshaped regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn based on the identification of white matter tracts on the color-coded maps. Then FA maps were overlaid on these color-coded directional maps. We placed 12 ovoid ROIs in the white matter regions on two slices, which included the temporal deep white matter adjacent to the temporal horns, the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the anterior deep white matter, the anterior periventricular white matter, and the posterior deep white matter and the posterior periventricular white matter (see Fig. 1). The non-midline regions were measured on both sides. For most regions, we used the ROI designations described by Fellgiebel et al. (8). The size of the ROIs was 8-12 voxels, measuring 1.878 mm 9 1.875 mm 9 5 mm each (9).",

    "Cortical thickness analysis": {
      "text": "The automatic cortical thickness analysis of the MRI was conducted using the pipelining method developed at Montreal Neurological Institute (10). First, intensity-based inuniformities, which resulted from the inhomogeneities in the magnetic field, were corrected with the N3 algorithm and the brain tissue was classified into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, using a 3D stereotaxic brain mask and the intensity-normalized stereotaxic environment for classification of tissues algorithm (11). Next, the brain was automatically divided into two separate hemispheres and the inner and outer surfaces of the cortex were automatically extracted, using the Constrained Laplacian-Based Automated Segmentation With proximities (CLASP) algorithm. The CLASP algorithm extracts the boundaries of the cortex by using a dense polygon mesh that is first expanded inside the white matter and fitted into the surface between the white matter and the inner surface of cortex. The outer surface of the cortex is detected by expanding the polygon mesh further into the surface between the gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Cortical thickness was defined as the Euclidean distance between the linked vertices of the outer and inner surfaces. Finally, the cortical thickness maps were smoothened using a surface-based 20 mm WHM diffusion kernel that has been demonstrated to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and the statistical power (12). The cortical thickness was calculated in the native space through applying an inverse transformation matrix to cortical surfaces and reconstructing in the native space (13). (14,15). Attention abilities were examined with Digit Span Forward from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III) (16,17). Verbal memory was assessed with Huashan Auditory Verbal Learning Test (HAVLT) in Chinese (18), which was modified from Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (19) and California Verbal Learning Test (20) to be suited to Chinese characters. The total learning score for each subject, that is, the mean score of three learning-free recall trials of 12 words, was collected and statistcally analyzed in this study. Visuospatial skills were evaluated with Clock Drawing Test (0-5 clock drawing test rating scale) (19). In the verbal fluency task, participants were instructed to name as many vegetables, animals, and fruits as possible in 1 min for each category (20). Besides, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was adopted in this study to investigate other aspects of cognitive functions and evaluate the global cognitive abilities (21).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Three major findings were noted in the present study. First, the subjects with PWMHS had lower scores for verbal fluency and executive function, which were mainly similar with the performance in the global cognitive function test. Next, decreased FA values of PWMHS were significantly associated with cortical thinning in the frontal pole, the superior and middle frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal gyrus, the superior and middle temporal gyrus, the insula and the lingual and cuneus gyrus. Finally, our study results support the hypothesis that PWMHs were associated with cortical thinning, which accounts for the disorders of verbal fluency and executive function in these subjects. We focused on five cognitive domains, including executive function, attention, verbal memory, visuospatial skills and verbal fluency, in the participants in this study. There is no consensus on which test should be sorted for assessing each domain of cognitive functions. We adopted Digit Span Forward for attention abilities, Auditory Verbal Learning Test for verbal memory, and Clock Drawing Test for visuospatial skills, which are commonly used in the assessment of corresponding cognitive function. We cannot fully evaluate executive function with a single test, because it is so complex and involves several elements in the process. Previous researches have shown the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity in the brief executive assessment obtained with Trail-Making Test (score difference of Part B subtracting Part A with 88 of sensitivity and 76 of specificity) (22). The verbal fluency task was also shown to provide good sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of executive function in the subjects with ischemic leukoaraiosis (88 for both sensitivity and specificity) (23). Hence, we adopted these tests for the assessment of executive and language abilities in this study. In addition, MoCA, which was recommended as a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for patients with vascular cognitive impairments (21), was also used to assess the global cognitive functions and more importantly to estimate the cognitive impairment severity in the subjects with PWMHS in this study.\nWe found that the decreased FA values of the frontal and parietal periventricular white matter were associated with executive dysfunction and verbal fluency impairments after adjusting for age, gender, years of education, and treatable vascular risk factors. This result is consistent with previous researches by using conventional MRI (22) or MRI-DTI, which also showed that the disorders of executive function and verbal fluency performance were associated with PWMHS in frontal and parietal lobes (24).\nIn the present study, the typical finding for the subjects with PWMHS compared to the controls was extensive cortical thinning located bilaterally in the lateral and medial frontal lobes, temporal lobes and occipital lobes. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that PWMHS is negatively correlated with cortical (25,26). The cortical thinning associated with WMLs may be through several mechanisms: first, denervation due to white matter lesions may result in secondary changes in the cortex (27); second, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion that induces WMLs may lead to cortical thinning simultaneously; finally, cortical neuronal loss due to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion may result in downstream axonal loss and demyelination in white matters (28).\nMore importantly, we showed that the associations between PWMHS and cognitive performance were lost when cortical thickness was added into the models. This finding suggests that the correlation between cognitive impairment and PWMHS is mediated by cortical atrophy, which is consistent with previous research showing that WMHs do not correlate significantly with levels of cognitive impairment when gray matter loss is accounted for (27). Recent studies examining subjects with age-related confluent WMLs also showed that cognitive impairment with confluent WMLs was directly related to frontal atrophy and that such atrophy was in turn related to WML severity (29). In contrast, several previous studies found that both PWMHS and frontal thinning were independently associated with executive dysfunction (30). There may be several explanations for this discrepancy. First, our study used samples with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls, while the previous study compared subjects with Alzheimers disease and subcortical vascular dementia. Second, the samples were limited to subjects with pure PWMHS on MRI in our study, while the previous studies included diffuse WMLs. Third, SBM was used for analyzing cortical thickness in our study, while the previous studies used VBM.\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, the number of participants is low, possibly giving rise to Type II errors. Future work with larger numbers of subjects with PWMHS and controls will provide more information. Second, we used brief cognitive measures, which could not fully evaluate cognitive functions in all aspects. For example, we assessed executive function by Trail-Making Test and the verbal fluency task which are not an integrated evaluation of this function, in spite of their high sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, one single measure of the AVLT only covers the learning aspect of verbal memory, thus excluding visual memory and delayed recall and recognition. Future studies should employ more extensive cognitive performance batteries. Finally, although we performed the ROI-based approach extremely carefully, the problems of manual ROI methods (which included limitations to circumscribing tissue and structural boundaries) could not be absolutely excluded.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that the impairments of executive function and verbal fluency in the subjects with PWMHS are mediated by cortical atrophy.",

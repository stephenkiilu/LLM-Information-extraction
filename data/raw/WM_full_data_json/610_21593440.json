    "abstract": "Objective: To determine the patterns of diffusivity associated with cognitive domain functions in older adults without dementia. Methods: We studied older adults without dementia (n ϭ 220) who underwent neuropsychometric testing and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination at 3 T in a cross-sectional study. Memory, language, attentionexecutive function, and visual-spatial processing domains were assessed within 4 months of the MRI examination. A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-based DTI sequence that enabled uncontaminated cortical diffusion measurements was performed. Associations between cortical mean diffusivity (MD) and cognitive function were tested using voxel-based regression analysis. Association between tract diffusivity and cognitive function was tested with regions of interest drawn on color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Results: Memory function was associated with the medial temporal lobe cortical MD on voxelbased analysis (p Ͻ 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus and posterior and anterior cingulum FA on tract-based analysis (p Ͻ 0.001). Language function was associated with the left temporal lobe cortical MD (p Ͻ 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, and posterior cingulum FA (p Ͻ 0.05). Attention and executive function was associated with the posterior and anterior cingulum FA, and visual-spatial function was associated with posterior cingulum FA (p Ͻ 0.01). Conclusion: Specific cognitive domain functions are associated with distinct patterns of cortical and white matter diffusivity in elderly with no dementia. Posterior cingulum tract FA was associated with all 4 cognitive domain functions, in agreement with the hypothesis that the posterior cingulate cortex is the main connectivity hub for cognitive brain networks.

Mean diffusivity (MD) increases with the degeneration of microstructural barriers such as myelin and cell membranes, and the directionality of diffusion measured with fractional anisotropy (FA) decreases with degeneration of the white matter (WM) tracts. 3 We investigated correlations between diffusivity measurements and specific cognitive domain functions in older adults without dementia who were either cognitively normal or diagnosed with MCI. Our objective was to determine whether regional alterations in tissue microstructure detected with DTI would be a valuable imaging marker for memory, language, attentionexecutive function, and visual-spatial processing domain functions. The rationale for including both cognitively normal and MCI cases was to identify the microstructural changes associated with cognitive function in a group that represents the widest range of cognitive functioning from normal to MCI, who are the focus of preventive and early therapeutic interventions in dementia.\nMETHODS Recruitment of subjects. Subjects were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimers Disease Research Center (ADRC), a dementia clinic-based cohort, and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a population-based cohort. 4 A total of 220 older subjects without dementia (149 MCI and 71 cognitively normal subjects) participated in the MRIDTI study during the period June 2007 through 2009. Characteristics of the study subjects are listed in table 1. Individuals participating in the ADRC and MCSA studies undergo approximately annual clinical examinations, MRI, routine laboratory tests, and neuropsychological tests. At the completion of the evaluation, a consensus committee meeting is held involving the behavioral neurologists, neuropsychologists, and nurses who evaluated the subjects to assign a clinical diagnosis to the participant.\nThe operational definition of MCI was based on clinical judgment through a careful history from the patient and preferably a collateral source without reference to MRI using the criteria for the broad definition of MCI. 5 The distribution of MCI subtypes was as follows: 67149 amnestic MCI single domain, 49149 amnestic MCI multiple domain, 23149 nonamnestic MCI single domain, 10149 nonamnestic MCI multiple domain. Patients with structural abnormalities, psychiatric diseases, or treatments that would have an effect on cognitive function were excluded. The cognitively normal group did not have any neurologic or psychiatric conditions, did not have a cognitive complaint, had normal neurologic and neurocognitive examination results, and were not taking psychoactive medications in doses that would affect cognition.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and informed consent for participation was obtained from every subject or an appropriate surrogate.",

Visual-spatial processing was examined by the WAIS-R Picture Completion and Block Design subtests. All tests were administered by experienced psychometrists and supervised by clinical neuropsychologists (R.J.I. and G.E.S.).

Maps of MD, FA, and color-coded FA were generated using the DTIStudio software. T1-weighted MRI volume of each subject was warped to his or her own FLAIR b0 image using an in-house modified version of the high dimensional warping toolbox in SPM5. Each subjects MRI scan was then spatially normalized to the custom template generated from 200 subjects with AD and 200 normal elderly subjects 11 using the unified segmentation model of SPM5 and segmented into gray matter (GM), WM, and CSF. The resulting deformation was applied to the FLAIR b0 images in native space in order to warp the segmented native FLAIR b0 images to the customized template. Voxel-based association between GM MD and cognitive function was assessed in SPM5. Statistical maps were displayed at a significance value of p Ͻ 0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) with a cluster size threshold of 20 voxels including age, gender, and education as covariables. WM tract-based analysis of MD and FA was performed by manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) on the color-coded FA maps using Analyze software (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) by a radiologist (B.Z.) who was blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Anatomic landmarks were used when placing the ROIs, which were transferred to the FLAIR b0 images to ensure CSF spaces and WM hyperintensities were avoided. We analyzed the FA of the major WM tracts including the corticopontine tracts, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, anterior and posterior cingulum tracts, and corpus callosum. The locations of many of these ROIs have been illustrated 12 (figure e-1 on the Neurology  Web site at www.neurology.org). Intrarater reliability for the manual ROI measurements was excellent with a within-subject coefficient of variation ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 across different ROIs.

Hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala are the key structures for memory function, typically involved with the pathology of AD earlier than other regions of the brain. Cortical MD increases with the loss of normal tissue microstructure such as disruption of neuronal cell membranes that restrict random motion of water molecules. DTI studies have consistently found elevated MD in the hippocampus and decreased FA in the main limbic pathways connecting to the hippocampus in MCI, 131415161718192021222324 and recently hippocampal MD predicted cognitive decline in healthy elderly people. 25 Early neurodegenerative changes, most commonly associated with AD in older adults without dementia, may be responsible for the elevated diffusivity in cortical regions that is associated with memory function.\nTract-based FA is a measure of directionality of diffusion, which decreases with the loss of myelin Abbreviations: FA ϭ fractional anisotropy; ROI ϭ region of interest; WM ϭ white matter. a Partial correlations control for age, sex, and education. b Significant.",

In the current study, decreased FA in tracts connecting to MTL, such as the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the cingulum tracts, significantly correlated with decreased memory function, indicating that memory function in older adults without dementia depends on both the integrity of MTL structures and their connectivity with other temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe regions. Although WM diffusion properties depend on aging throughout the adult lifespan, 26,27 the associations we found were independent of age effects on WM diffusivity, suggesting that loss of WM integrity may be an early feature of neurodegenerative dementia pathology. 28 Language domain function was assessed using confrontation naming and category fluency tests that focus on word retrieval and visual naming functions. fMRI and lesion studies have long indicated that semantic processing and word retrieval is localized to left temporal pole, fusiform, middle temporal, and posterior inferior temporal gyri. 29 -31 In the current study, language function was associated with the left temporal pole, anterior fusiform, posterior middle, and inferior temporal gyri MD, which is in agreement with the typical localization of word retrieval and visual naming functions. This pattern matched well with the pattern of association between language domain function and cortical atrophy except in the left posterior temporal lobe, where no association was identified between language domain function and cortical atrophy. Moreover, FA of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which connects these cortical regions, significantly correlated with the language domain function. Correlations with inferior longitudinal fasciculus, however, was not lateralized to the left temporal lobe, but involved the inferior longitudinal fasciculi in both hemispheres. There was also a weaker but significant correlation between language function and posterior cingulum tract FA. Overall, these data demonstrated that the connectivity within the temporal lobes as well as the connectivity between the temporal lobe and parietal association areas are critical for language function, a finding in agreement with a previous DTI study in early AD. 32 Attentionexecutive domain function is typically localized to the frontal lobes in fMRI and lesion studies. 33 In the current study, we did not identify a relationship between cortical MD, atrophy, and attentionexecutive domain function. However, significant associations were present between attention executive domain function and anterior and posterior cingulum tract FA.

In addition, there was a weaker association between the fornix and superior longitudinal fasciculus FA and visual-spatial processing domain function. We measured the FA from the dorsal component of superior longitudinal fasciculus which constitutes the thickest portion of the tract that connects the caudal parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Lesion studies in monkeys and humans suggest that this tract provides information concerning the perception of the visual space from the parietal lobe to the prefrontal cortex. 35 The posterior parietal association cortex is a component of the spatial-attention network through the dorsal visual stream, which may be responsible for the association between the visual-spatial processing domain function and the posterior cingulum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus tract FA. 36 Structural integrity of the posterior cingulum tract on DTI was associated with all 4 cognitive domain functions, in agreement with the resting state fMRI findings indicating that posterior cingulate cortex is the main connectivity hub for the major cortical networks. 37,38 AD is the most common dementia pathology encountered in older adults without dementia, and the frequency and severity of AD pathology is associated with impaired cognitive function, even in people who do not have dementia. 39 Other neurodegenerative pathologies that are associated with cognitive impairment in older adults without dementia include dementia with Lewy bodies, which is usually mixed with the AD pathology, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which is relatively infrequent compared to AD. 39 Because loss of cingulum tract integrity on DTI is typically seen in early AD, we hypothesize that the presence of early AD pathology in some of our elderly adults without dementia may be driving the association between cognitive function and posterior cingulum tract integrity. We are planning to test this hypothesis with future longitudinal studies.\nMemory and language domain functions were associated with both MD in temporal lobe cortex regions and FA in WM tracts that connect to these temporal lobe cortices. On the contrary, attention executive and visual-spatial processing domain functions were associated only with WM tract FA in the parietal and frontal lobe regions but not the cortical MD. One explanation for this dissociation among the individual cognitive domains is that the temporal course of the WM tract degeneration may be different from the temporal course cortical degeneration that is most commonly associated with early AD pathology in patients with MCI and cognitively normal elderly. Because the pathology of AD involves temporal lobes earlier than other regions of the brain, cognitive domains that are impaired early in the disease course of AD such as memory and language domains would be associated with the altered integrity of the temporal lobe cortices as demonstrated in the current study. Conversely, visual-spatial processing and attentionexecutive function may be associated with cortical integrity outside of the temporal lobe that has not yet been involved with the neurodegenerative pathology in the subjects without dementia we studied. The finding that these domain functions were only associated with WM tract FA in the parietal and frontal lobe regions suggests that the disruption of WM tract integrity may be preceding or promoting the changes in cortical microstructure associated with impairment in the visual-spatial processing and attentionexecutive function domains that occur later. 40 A second explanation for this dissociation among the cognitive domains may be the more focal representation of memory and language in contrast to the anatomically widespread representation of the visual-spatial processing and attention executive function domains in the cortex, thereby identifying a regional association between cortical MD and visual-spatial processing and attentionexecutive function domains was not possible due to insufficient effect size on voxel-based analysis.\nThe current study demonstrates that specific cognitive domain functions are associated with distinct patterns of cortical and WM diffusivity in elderly without dementia. We studied a cohort of older adults without dementia who represent a wide range of cognitive functioning from normal to MCI in order to include the complete range of cognitive functioning in subjects without dementia. Although each cognitive domain was associated with a characteristic pattern of diffusion abnormalities, abnormal FA in the posterior cingulum tract was a unifying feature that spanned all cognitive domains.",

    "abstract": "Purpose-In diffusion MRI (dMRI), fractional anisotropy derived from the single-tensor model (FA DTI ) is the most widely used metric to characterize white matter (WM) micro-architecture, despite known limitations in regions with crossing fibers. Due to time constraints when scanning patients in clinical settings, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) acquisition protocols, often used to overcome these limitations, are still rare in clinical population studies. However, the tensor distribution function (TDF) may be used to model multiple underlying fibers by representing the diffusion profile as a probabilistic mixture of tensors. Methods-We compared the ability of standard FA DTI and TDF-derived FA (FA TDF ), calculated from a range of dMRI angular resolutions (41, 30, 15, and 7 gradient directions), to profile WM deficits in 251 individuals from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and to detect associations with (1) AD diagnosis, (2) Clinical Dementia Rating scores, and (3) average hippocampal volume. Results-Across angular resolutions and statistical tests, FA TDF showed larger effect sizes than FA DTI , particularly in regions preferentially affected by AD, and was less susceptible to crossing fiber anomalies. Conclusion- The TDF corrected form of FA may be a more sensitive and accurate alternative to the commonly-used FA DTI , even in clinical quality dMRI data.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a variant of standard MRI that can measure the diffusion of water molecules in biological tissues, such as the brain. By characterizing the diffusion process at the voxel level, we can make tentative inferences about the underlying white matter (WM) microstructure and factors that affect it (1). Since dMRI was developed, acquisition protocols have improved to increase angular, spatial, and spectral resolution. Multiple mathematical models have been developed to describe the diffusion process. One of the first -and still most popular -methods to summarize diffusion properties in a specific voxel is the single tensor model (2) commonly referred to as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (3). This model is limited as it assumes diffusion is purely Gaussian; it can only model a single fiber population, with a single dominant orientation, at every voxel. It cannot resolve complex WM architecture, such as dispersing, crossing or kissing fibers. Yet, at the current resolution of dMRI, between one-third and two-thirds of WM voxels contain fiber crossings (4,5). dMRI can also be used to evaluate disease-related gray matter (GM) abnormalities, where the micro-architecture is even more complex (6). Nevertheless, the tensor-derived fractional anisotropy (FA DTI ) metric is still the most widely used scalar measure to characterize tissue micro-architecture. It is widely used in research studies of schizophrenia, depression, autism, HIVAIDS, and other developmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (7,8).\nIn recent years, many new models have been proposed to overcome limitations of the tensor model, including q-ball imaging and diffusion orientation distribution functions (ODF) (9), constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) (10), multicompartment models such as the ball and stick model (4), diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) (11), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) (12). Due to the numerous types of biological, neuropsychiatric and imaging data often acquired for clinical populations, time constraints are often placed on imaging protocols to reduce patient attrition or motion, and ensure adequate sample sizes. This precludes state of the art models like DSI and NODDI, which require extremely dense or multi-shell acquisitions, and may prevent the reliable reconstruction of many other higher-order diffusion models. However, the tensor distribution function (TDF), as proposed by (13), may still be feasible. The TDF is a probabilistic extension of a multi-tensor model that describes crossing fibers mathematically as an ensemble of Gaussian tensors. However, unlike other multicompartment models (4,12,(14)(15)(16) where one needs to specify in advance the total number of compartments in the tissue, the authors propose a continuous distribution of tensors, with a profile of weights or relative contributions estimated for tensors with a continuously varying range of shapes and sizes, in the tensor space. The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a large longitudinal multisite study of healthy elderly controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimers disease (AD). The goal is to identify sensitive imaging biomarkers that can be used to track or predict changes in the brain, which is vital for drug trials to identify candidates for treatment and monitor effectiveness. In addition to the battery of cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests, ADNI collects several functional and structural MRI modalities including T1 and T2-weighted anatomical MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and resting state functional MRI, and dMRI. In such longitudinal studies, there is a real concern about patient attrition, especially in elderly individuals who may not be able to tolerate being confined to a scanner for long periods. In an effort to collect such a wide range of data-types and maintain patient enrollment, there are time constraints placed on possible dMRI protocols, including debates as to whether or not to continue acquiring dMRI in the next phase of ADNI. Clearly it is of great interest to maximize the power of the available scans and show that even clinical quality diffusion scans can be powerful tools for uncovering disease related abnormalities in tissue microstructure and WM neurocircuitry.\nHere we aimed to find whether FA metrics derived using the TDF model (FA TDF ) may be more sensitive to disease-related differences than the corresponding FA DTI measure that is now widely used. Building upon preliminary findings in (17), our goal was to understand how the imaging protocol may influence the sensitivity of the metrics, and further compared performance for each metric computed from subsamples of the full ADNI dMRI 41 gradient direction angular resolution, including subsets of 30, 15, and 7 gradient directions. Voxelwise association tests were used to compare FA TDF and FA DTI metrics computed from a range of angular resolutions, and their ability to detect microstructural differences between AD patients and healthy elderly controls (CN). We also evaluated associations between the two FA metrics and common AD biomarkers-hippocampal volume and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Finally, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of each models fit and the resulting scalar FA maps. In comparing models, there is interest in detecting clinical associations with maximal sensitivity and power, ideally using improved metrics, which measure standard properties more accurately.",

      "text": "Standard MRI, dMRI, and clinical data were downloaded from the publicly available Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.usc.eduADNI). We analyzed baseline data from 251 participants: 53 healthy controls (CN; mean age: 72.6 -6.1 yrs; 24M29F), 28 with significant memory concern (SMC; mean age: 72.4-4.5 yrs; 10M18F), 121 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean age: 72.6-7.3 yrs; 75M46F and 49 with AD (mean age: 75.0-8.6 yrs; 29M20F). Of the 53 CN participants, 33 returned for follow-up evaluations after 3 months and their scans were used for test-retest analyses (mean age: 72.8-6.5 yrs; 16M17F). All procedures were reviewed and approved by institutional review boards. All participants gave written informed consent.\nAll subjects underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on 3T GE Medical Systems scanners at 17 acquisition sites across North America. Anatomical T1-weighted SPGR (spoiled gradient echo) sequences (256256 matrix; voxel size  1.21.01.0 mm 3 ; TI400 ms; TR  6.98 ms; TE  2.85 ms; flip angle11), and dMRI (128128 matrix; voxel size: 2.72.72.7 mm 3 ; TR9000 ms; dMRI scan time  9 min) were collected. 46 separate images were acquired for each dMRI scan: 5 T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b 0 images) and 41 diffusion-weighted images (DWI; b1000 smm 2 ).\nBaseline hippocampal volume summary metrics, processed using the FreeSurfer package (http:surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), were downloaded from the ADNI database (n243 available), as was the sum-of-boxes Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-sob; n238) (18).",

Gradient subsets were selected by optimizing the spherical angular distribution energy. Briefly, the angular distribution energy, E ij , of a pair of points, i and j, on the unit sphere may be defined as the inverse of the sum of the squares of (1) the least spherical distance between point i and point j, and (2) the least spherical distance between point i and point js antipodal, symmetric point J. As in prior work, we acknowledge that protocols with fewer gradients would be independently optimized for angular distribution rather than subsample directions from an existing protocol, but the subsampling we use is designed to lead to the most equally distributed sampling on the sphere possible. It also helps us to assess effects of gradient count while keeping other factors of the patients scan constant (e.g. motion, artifacts).",

    "dMRI Reconstruction Models and Scalar Maps": {
      "text": "For each angular resolution (41, 30, 15, or 7 gradient directions), three different dMRI reconstruction models were used to generate scalar FA maps. First, a single diffusion tensor (3) -equivalent to a 3D ellipsoid capturing a single fiber orientation -was modeled at each voxel in the brain from the corrected DWI scans. This model assumes that the diffusion is a 3D Gaussian process, fitted using just six independent parameters of a tensor (3 eigenvalues describing its shape, and 3 Euler angles describing its orientation). Scalar fractional anisotropy (FA DTI ) maps were obtained from the resulting diffusion tensor eigenvalues (λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 ):\nIn contrast to the single tensor model, the tensor distribution function (TDF) represents the diffusion profile as a probabilistic mixture of tensors that optimally explain the observed DWI data, allowing for the reconstruction of multiple underlying fibers per voxel, together with a distribution of weights. We applied the framework proposed in (13,21) to the angular diffusion signal, to compute the voxel-wise optimal TDF P  (D(θ, λ))the probability distribution function of all feasible Gaussian tensors D(θ, λ) that best describes the observed signal. As in (13), to reduce the solution space, each tensor D(θ, λ) at spherical angle θ was assumed to be cylindrical such that λ(λ 1 ,λ 2 λ 3 ) and λ 1 λ 2 . However, unlike the gradient descent approach in (13) to solve for this optimal TDF, here we used a quadratic programming approach (see Appendix A for details). The tensor orientation distribution function (TOD), was then calculated by computing the marginal density function of the TDF with the eigenvalues λ (λ 1 , λ 2 ) integrated out.\nFor each θ, the eigenvalues are calculated by computing the expected value of each eigenvalue along θ, from which a corresponding scalar FA metric is calculated:\nAt each voxel, the final scalar FA TDF metric across all θ is then calculated as the sum of all FA(θ) weighted by the probability that θ is the principal fiber direction, TOD(θ).\nA healthy control subjects FA DTI and FA TDF maps, calculated from various angular resolutions, are shown in Figure 1a and 1b for visual comparison. A voxel-wise two-tailed paired T-test was performed to quantitatively compare TDF and DTI FA values in the healthy control group. All resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons  Many investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI andor provided data, but most of them did not participate in this analysis or writing this report. A complete list of ADNI investigators may be found at: https: adni.loni.usc.eduwp-contentuploadshow_to_applyADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf using the standard false discovery rate (FDR) method at q0.05 (22), and thresholded at the FDR critical P-value.\nFor comparison to an established HARDI technique also designed to reconstruct multiple fiber orientations in a given voxel, we fitted orientation distribution functions (ODFs) at each voxel, with a non-parametric q-ball reconstruction technique, using the normalized and dimensionless constant solid angle (CSA) method (9,23). The generalized FA (GFA ODF ) was then calculated from the CSA-ODF. GFA ODF is analogous to FA DTI , but calculated at each diffusion direction of the ODF (9) and is defined as:\nHere, Ψ(u) is the ODF, i is each diffusion direction and is the mean of the ODF.",

Similarly, to spatially normalize each subjects three FA maps we performed a 3-channel linear then non-linear registration to the MDT. In this way all FA maps were used to drive the registration and they were all normalized to the same space. To avoid differences in registration accuracy, the deformations from the full angular resolution registration were applied to the FA maps calculated from the various DWI gradient subsets for each individual.\nTest-retest FA DTI and FA TDF maps generated from baseline and 3-month follow-up dMRI scans were each linearly aligned to an intermediate space half way between each subjects two time points (25). Baseline and follow-up maps were each spatially normalized to the baseline MDT with 2-channel linear then non-linear registrations. The deformations from the full angular resolution registration were applied to the various DWI gradient subsets as well as the respective FA maps",

    "Clinical Associations and Effect Sizes": {
      "text": "As expected, across all of the FA metrics, AD diagnosis, greater cognitive impairment (higher CDR-sob score), and lower average hippocampal volume, were associated with significant WM deficits (lower FA) after correction for multiple comparisons (Figure 2a). However, across statistical tests, larger effect sizes, as denoted by greater β-value magnitude and more widespread differences, were detected with FA TDF voxel maps, as compared to FA DTI and GFA ODF . Moreover, FA TDF findings are highly localized to the temporal lobe and hippocampal regions most vulnerable to early changes in AD. CDF plots further reflect the increased sensitivity of FA TDF for differentiating disease groups, and for detecting clinical associations (Figure 2b).\nAcross maps, some very small regions exhibited significant associations with FA in direction contrary to what would traditionally be accepted as showing impairment (i.e., higher FA with impairment; Figure 2a boxed regions). These regions were largely found at the junction of the corpus callosum commissural fibers and the corona radiata, a region notorious for fiber crossings that may reduce the FA, as computed from the tensor model (32). However, across analyses, FA TDF showed fewer associations that were contrary to the hypothesized effects of the disease (Figure 2c). Relative to the total number of significant voxels, FA DTI showed between 13-15 of these voxels, GFA ODF showed 8-10, while FA TDF showed 0.5 across tests, suggesting that FA TDF may be handling computations better for crossing fibers.\nA comparison of the same three clinical associations on FA DTI and FA TDF computed from a subset of 30, 15 and 7 gradient directions reveals that even at 7 gradient directions, FA TDF is consistently the most sensitive metric across statistical tests (Table 1; Figure 3). In fact FA TDF calculated from 7 gradient directions has larger effect sizes than FA DTI calculated at the full angular resolution. Across statistical tests performed at each angular resolution, FA TDF consistently showed less than 0.5 of significant voxels with a direction of association opposite to that hypothesized, compared to FA DTI which showed 5-15 (Table 1). Finally, the mean Cohens d effect sizes for picking up AD versus CN group differences, calculated from test data from the 10-fold cross validation, once again confirm that across all angular resolutions, FA TDF showed larger effect sizes (Table 2).",

The mean rRMSE maps from DTI and TDF models from 33 healthy control individuals at two time points are shown in Figure 4c and4d. While the rRMSE is high in both the TDF and DTI models in the superior cortical gray matter (mean rRMSE  1), the fit is stable ( 1) in WM and overall temporal lobe regions where most of the AD-related effects were detected. A T-test between the DTI and TDF rRMSE maps (Figure 5b) reveals significantly lower rRMSE with the TDF fit, in not only the temporal lobes, but in the region of the superior WM where commissural fibers and the corona radiata intersect, often leading to depleted FA DTI . The TDF model shows higher error only in CSF. TDF rRMSE is progressively more similar to DTI (i.e. less area of significant differences) with lower angular resolution (FDR critical P-value for 41 gradients  0.024, 30 gradients 0.021, 15 gradients  0.017, and 7 gradients  0.001).\nIn terms of test-retest reliability of the scalar FA maps, we found that across resolutions there was an overall stable and strong ICC between baseline and follow-up FA TDF maps (mean ICC 0.8; Figure 5c), while, as might be expected, there was a degradation in FA DTI ICC at the lowest angular resolutions (Figure 5d).",

    "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS": {
      "text": "Here we show that FA metrics derived from the tensor distribution function (TDF) may be more sensitive to disease related microstructural abnormalities than corresponding single tensor-derived FA metrics that are now widely used to assess clinical data. FA is highly affected by numerous factors including the number of dominant fiber directions and orientation coherence as well as partial volume effects from neighboring gray matter. By using the TDF approach, we can still employ an extension of the tensor model, adapted to identify contributions to FA from separate crossing fiber compartments in tissue with more complex micro-architecture and voxels on tissue boundaries that are susceptible to partial voluming.\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by cortical and hippocampal neuronal loss and widespread gray matter (GM) atrophy driven in part by cortical amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle deposits, and vascular changes. Structural and diffusion MRI studies show white matter (WM) injury -perhaps due to myelin degeneration, and neuronal loss leading to progressive disconnection of cortical and subcortical regions (7,(33)(34)(35)(36). Standard anatomical MRI is still the imaging technique most often used in AD studies and clinical trials, but dMRI is sensitive to microscopic changes in WM integrity not always detectable with standard anatomical MRI (37,38). In addition to WM, dMRI is an emerging tool for the evaluation of disease related gray matter (GM) abnormalities as well (6,(39)(40)(41)(42)(43). A growing number of studies assess cortical and subcortical GM diffusivity changes in AD that may reflect GM cellular microstructure breakdown (6). Several studies report microscopic changes in the hippocampi that may be detectable prior to volumetric changes (43,44). As dMRI changes may be detectable prior to, and predict gross volume loss (45,46), it is important to maximize the power to detect such changes.\nIn this study, we found that compared to both GFA ODF and FA DTI , FA TDF showed increased power to detect subtle or diffuse disease effects, especially in hippocampal and temporal lobe regions. AD pathology targets GM regions especially in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. In these regions, FA DTI might be sub-optimal, as it is best suited to detect differences in cohesive WM fiber bundles such as the corpus callosum. We also found more significant FA TDF associations in voxels at GM or CSF boundaries that may otherwise be susceptible to partial volume effects with FA DTI . Compared to FA DTI , larger FA TDF effect sizes were preserved even when the dMRI angular resolution was subsampled from 41 gradient directions to 30, 15, or even 7 gradient directions. Perhaps surprisingly, FA TDF calculated from 7 gradient directions had larger effect sizes than FA DTI calculated at the full angular resolution. While some higher order models require extremely dense or multi-shell acquisitions, TDF may better extract the information typically available in clinical settings, where time constraints limit scan times. It may also be helpful for studies of valuable but lower-resolution legacy data. The TDF as proposed by (13) makes no assumptions about the number of compartments per voxel and, unlike the tensor distribution function previously proposed by (47), does not impose the same exact anisotropy profile on all fiber compartments. This may lead to better estimates if there are higher levels of uncertainty in the data, such as may arise with low resolution data.\nFurthermore, FA TDF may also help to interpret apparent increases in FA DTI found in disease. In many contexts, lower FA is hypothesized to reflect impairment. However, relative increases in FA have been reported in FA DTI studies of AD, which may reflect a selective sparing or selective degeneration of one of the pathways in a region with crossing fibers (48). However, without histologic data, we cannot be certain whether selective degeneration or increased integrity, or some mix of both, is driving higher FA DTI values in a neuroimaging study. FA TDF , on the other hand, takes into account crossing fiber compartments. A relatively higher FA may more consistently reflect healthier tissue, while lower FA more consistently reflects deficits, making the direction of associations easier to interpret. Across analyses, we found that FA TDF showed fewer contrary to hypothesis regions (i.e., higher FA associated with greater deficits). Across all statistical tests and angular resolutions, compared to FA TDF , FA DTI showed both a higher absolute number of these types of significant voxels, and a higher percentage relative to the total number of significant voxels (5-15 of voxels versus 0.5 with FA TDF ), suggesting that FA TDF may in fact be resolving crossing fibers.\nAnalyses of test-retest reliability and model fit show that the TDF is quite reliable and robust in regions that show disease effects in this analysis. Some instability in test-retest reliability is to be expected when using the ADNI dataset -the scans are 3 months apart, and the healthy control participants are elderly (mean age: 72.8 -6.5 yrs). These individuals may show some biological aging and white matter deterioration, even over the 3-month interscan interval. All registrations were visually evaluated, but age-related changes and minor geometric miscalibration of the scanner may also contribute to minor discrepancies in alignment between 2 scans from the same subject, contributing to both the final ICC and rRMSE measure in both the DTI and TDF models.\nA prior study also showed that FA TDF was a more stable metric with decreasing spatial resolution, where FA DTI values decreased more rapidly due to more fiber incoherence and greater partial voluming in larger voxels (49). However, further analyses of FA TDF limitations on a wider range of diffusion protocols and comparisons of performance to numerous other proposed scalar metrics are necessary. In addition to FA, there is also a growing interest in assessing complementary diffusivity metrics, including mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD). As, FA is an inherently normalized measure and diffusivity metrics are not, future work is necessary to define analogous measures within the TDF framework.\nMulti-shell and other DSI or q-space techniques may ultimately outperform tensor model metrics, but they are often less feasible given the time constraints on dMRI protocols in clinical settings, as well as for recovering information from valuable legacy data. The TDF model may ultimately allow us to take advantage of such available clinical quality diffusion data with more sensitivity and fewer limitations than the classic DTI model. where N is the number of DW scans; -is the matrix of elements,\n. Clearly, we search for a vector x that minimizes the cost function with two constraints:\nWhich lends itself to a classic quadratic programming (QP) problem (50). By definition, the matrix is positive semi-definite, which means that the problem is convex. However, by construction, the rank of the matrix H cannot exceed N (the number of observations). So if the tensor space sampling has more than N points, then the problem has multiple optimal solutions. The original gradient descent approach in (13) used the substitution to meet the constraint . It also used a feasibledirection gradient descent method, projecting the steepest descent direction onto the constraint . Even so, as long as P is sought as a non-parametric distribution based on a sampling at pre-defined grid points, multiple optimal solutions still remain a problem. Instead, we use the primal-dual predictor-corrector interior-point method (51) to solve the optimization problem. The method that we use is one of the interior-point methods family, which converges to a unique solution from the feasible interior region to the optimum, following the central path (52). Generally, interior-point methods solve the problem:\ngiven (in our case) , , and the constraint and as defined above. Starting with large , this functional is being decreased on every step, enforcing the solution to be close to the line , which is a minimizer for the term. A QP solver implemented as compiled C code (http: sigpromu.orgquadprog) was used for solving the minimization problem.",

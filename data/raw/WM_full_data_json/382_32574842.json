The main aim of this study was to assess WM integrity and abnormities in a cohort of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD as well as normal controls (NCs). For this purpose, we first used AFQ to identify 20 major WM tracts and assessed WM integrity and abnormalities in a cohort of 120 subjects (39 NCs, 34 aMCI patients and 47 AD patients) in a discovery dataset and 122 subjects (43 NCs, 37 aMCI patients and 42 AD patients) in a replicated dataset. Pointwise differences along WM tracts were identified in the discovery dataset and simultaneously confirmed in the replicated dataset. Next, we investigated the utility of DTI measures along WM tracts as features to distinguish patients with AD from NCs via",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia in elderly patients, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive function. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a transitional state between healthy aging and dementia characterized by prominent memory impairment and likely progression to AD (Knopman  Petersen, 2014;Petersen et al., 2006). Approximately 50 million people have AD and related forms of dementia, and someone in the world is diagnosed with dementia every 3 sec (Academy of Cognitive Disorders of et al., 2020; World Alzheimer Report -The state of the art of dementia research: new frontiers, 2018). AD causes substantial pain to patients and their families and imposes an extraordinary financial burden, with global estimates for costs attributed to dementia of approximately 2.54 trillion in 2030 and 9.12 trillion in 2050 (Jia et al., 2018). Thus, accurate datadriven methods that can classify and characterize the neural features of AD would be powerful clinical tools that may facilitate optimization of treatment methods to delay disease progression (Ewers, Sperling, Klunk, Weiner,  Hampel, 2011;Jack et al., 2017;Jack  Holtzman, 2013;Perrin, Fagan,  Holtzman, 2009). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures water diffusion in brain tissue. AD is associated with altered water diffusion in the brain and reduced white matter (WM) integrity (Yin et al., 2015). To evaluate the structural integrity of WM based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxelwise metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are generally considered sensitive measures for axonalmyelin damage. Additionally, axial diffusivity (AxD) is a measure of water diffusion along the principal axis of diffusion; radial diffusivity (RD) refers to the two vectors of diffusion perpendicular to the primary direction of diffusion, both of which are preferred for quantitative analyses of brain microstructure (Le Bihan et al., 2001). Many previous studies have investigated structural abnormalities in AD and have performed quantitative comparisons using WM metrics derived from DTI, and the results are well summarized in a number of extensive reviews (Mak et al., 2017;Sexton, Kalu, Filippini, Mackay,  Ebmeier, 2011;Yin et al., 2015). A recent study suggested that the loss of WM integrity reflects tau accumulation in AD (Strain et al., 2018) or APOE-ε4 homozygotes (Operto et al., 2018), shedding light on possible AD-associated structural mechanisms. Moreover, several different analytical methods have been developed based on the diffusion tensor model, including standard region of interest (ROI) analysis (Kantarci et al., 2001), voxel-based analysis, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006), TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRA-CULA) (Yendiki et al., 2011), automated fiber quantification (AFQ) (Yeatman, Dougherty, Myall, Wandell,  Feldman, 2012), fixel-based analysis (FBA) (Raffelt et al., 2017), and 3D tract-specific analysis (Jin et al., 2017). Among these methods, AFQ is a fully automated approach that can rapidly and reliably identify major WM fiber tracts and allow further analysis of diffusion properties at anatomically equivalent locations along the tract trajectory. Accordingly, AFQ is widely used across clinical and basic science, such as in studies of brain development and aging (Teubner-Rhodes et al., 2016) and schizophrenia (Sun et al., 2015). Although remarkable advances have been achieved in the understanding of WM changes in AD, a complete characterization of whole-brain fibers and their potential clinical translation still require further investigation.\nNeuroimaging techniques, which immediately reveal the structural details and functional activity of the brain, are helpful for predicting and monitoring disease progression. In recent years, many studies have investigated the possibility of neuroimaging-based classification and prediction of AD and MCI (For reviews see Basaia et al., 2019;Lian, Liu, Zhang,  Shen, 2020;Rathore, Habes, Iftikhar, Shacklett,  Davatzikos, 2017). Microstructural changes that are not visible with conventional volumetric techniques might be detected earlier than brain atrophy; the diffusion-weighted MRI technique is sensitive to microstructural changes, which is why several ADMCI studies suggest paying more attention to diffusion measures in studying AD (For a review see Weston, Simpson, Ryan, Ourselin,  Fox, 2015). For example, studies based on European DTI Study on Dementia (EDSD) multicenter datasets (Brueggen et al., 2017) serve as reminders to focus on tractography, network connectivity measures, or voxelwise measures when examining brain changes in AD and MCI (Brueggen et al., 2017;Dyrba et al., 2013;Dyrba, Grothe, Kirste,  Teipel, 2015;Nir, Villalon-Reina, et al., 2015). In general, the development of valid biomarkers is crucial for optimizing individualized care in clinical applications for AD. Thus, identifying reproducible and generalizable markers is essential for the research community. Accordingly, we investigated the reproducibility and diagnostic value of microstructural WM integrity based on diffusion-weighted MRI. The first goal of the present study is to evaluate whether the severe damage c o r t e x 1 2 9 ( 2 0 2 0 ) 3 9 0 e4 0 5 reflected by brain WM measures in patients with AD is evident in patients with aMCI but to a lesser degree and whether abnormal microstructural WM integrity measures correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The second goal is to determine whether WM diffusion indicators along fiber tracts reflect disease severity and can be used as early markers to distinguish patients from healthy subjects. The third goal is to evaluate the reproducibility of the findings.",

      "text": "We report how we determined our sample, all data exclusions, all inclusionexclusion criteria, whether inclusionexclusion criteria were established prior to data analysis, all manipulations, and all measures in the study.\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All subjects or their legal guardians (usually a family member) signed written informed consent forms. All of the participants were 55 to 85 years old and were neurological inpatients or outpatients of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All participants met identical methodological stringency criteria; comprehensive clinical details can be found in our previous studies (Feng et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2015;Yao et al., 2013;Zhan et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2012Zhang et al., , 2014;;Zhou et al., 2013). This study was an extension research with indepedent cross-validation of our previus work (Dou et al., 2019). Here, we provide only a very brief introduction of the data inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and acquisition methods to maintain the scientific integrity of the present study.\nClinical, physical and neuropsychological assessments were performed before MRI examination at the Department of Neurology of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All participants were right-handed and underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the MMSE, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage et al., 1982), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (Morris, 1993), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale (Feng et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2015;Yao et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2012Zhang et al., , 2014;;Zhou et al., 2013). In brief, the AVLT consisted of one learning trial in which a list of 10 Chinese double-character words was read, after which the subject was asked to immediately recall as many items as possible (AVLT-Immediate Recall). The immediate recall score was the average of 3 accurate recalls. After a 5-min delay, each subject was asked to recall the words from the initial list (AVLT-Delayed Recall). The subjects were then instructed to identify the 10 studied words in a list containing the studied words mixed with 10 new words (AVLT-Recognition) (Zhou et al., 2013).\nThe recruited patients with AD fulfilled the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for the diagnosis of probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). The inclusion criteria for AD patients were as follows: (1) a diagnosis of AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD; (2) a CDR ¼ 1 or 2; (3) no current treatment with nootropic drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors; and (4) the ability to perform the neuropsychological tests and tolerate MR scanning. Patients with aMCI were required to fulfill the criteria described by Petersen (Petersen, 2004). The diagnostic criteria for MCI were determined as previously described (Petersen et al., 1999) and included the following items: (1) memory complaints for at least 6 months; (2) a CDR ¼ .5; (3) an intact functional status and ADL score  26; and (4) no dementia. Patients with AD and aMCI also met the core clinical criteria of the new diagnostic criteria for probable AD and aMCI due to AD (Albert et al., 2011;McKhann et al., 2011). The criteria for age-and gendermatched normal control (NC) participants included the following items: (1) a normal physical status; (2) a CDR ¼ 0; and (3) no memory complaints.\nThe exclusion criteria for participants in this study included the following items: (1) metabolic conditions such as hypothyroidism or vitamin B12folic acid deficiencies; (2) psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression; (3) a brain infarction or hemorrhage as indicated by MRICT; (4) Parkinsonian syndrome, epilepsy and other nervous system diseases that can influence cognitive function; (5) a history of cerebrovascular attacks or other degenerative disorders; and (6) the presence of a metallic foreign body such as a cochlear implant or heart stent or other relevant MR scanning contraindications (Guo et al., 2014;Zhou et al., 2013).",

Diffusion-weighted images were preprocessed by the open-source VISTASOFT package version 1.0 (https: github.comvistalabvistasoft). For routine DTI processing, eddy current and head motion correction, skull stripping, and tensor model fitting were all performed using the dtilnit preprocessing pipeline wrapper running on MATLAB version 8.4.0 (R2014b) (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Briefly, the DTI data were preprocessed with eddy current correction, head motion correction, skull stripping, and tensor model fitting. Then, several DTI-induced measures (FA, MD, RD, and AxD) were computed. Next, we identified 20 major fiber tracts of the whole brain using the AFQ toolkit (https:github.com yeatmanlabAFQ) (version 1.2) (Yeatman et al., 2012(Yeatman et al., , 2018)). First, whole-brain deterministic fiber tractography was estimated. The tracking algorithm starts within a WM mask defined by voxels with FA values greater than .3; the path integration procedure then traces the fibers in both directions along principal diffusion axes. Tracing is terminated when FA.2 or the minimum angle between the last path segment and next step is greater than 30 . Fiber tract segmentation was performed using the waypoint ROI procedure, and fiber refinement was accomplished by comparing each candidate fiber to fiber tract probability maps (the 20 identified major fiber tracts and their abbreviations are listed in Table S1). After tract identification, the fiber points of each tract were resampled to 100 equidistant points, and then the diffusion measurements of each participant, including the FA, MD, RD and AxD, were extracted along the fiber tracts (Yeatman et al., 2012(Yeatman et al., , 2018)).",

For each identified fiber tract, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of each pointwise diffusion measure (FA, MD, RD and AxD) was performed after regressing out age and gender effects to identify differences among the groups (p  .05, FDR corrected across all 100 points).\nTo verify significant differences between each pair of groups, we further performed post hoc analyses using two-sample two-sided t-tests after controlling for age and gender (p  .05, FDR corrected).",

To assess the multivariate performance of pointwise diffusion metrics, we utilized the nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which was implemented in LIBSVM (https: www.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvm) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, to solve binary classification problems (NC vs aMCI, NC vs AD and aMCI vs AD groups). Four kinds of pointwise diffusion indicators (FA, MD, RD and AxD) were used as raw features, including 7200 features (18 fibers Â 100 points Â 4 types) for each participant. Additionally, to reduce local dramatic variation caused by imaging noise, we smoothed the raw features using a 5-point average; thus, 1440 features (18 fibers Â 20 points Â 4 types) were used for each participant.\nFor cross validation within the discovery and replicated datasets (intraclassification), the performance of the classifier was evaluated via the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method and 10-fold cross validation method. To ensure generalization of performance, we also evaluated the performance of intercenter cross validation (the interclassification, training and testing datasets were completely independent) by first using the discovery data as a training set to train the model and the replicated data as a test set; an inverse procedure was then performed (Abraham et al., 2017;Rozycki et al., 2018). Notably, for the interclassification steps, we first excluded from the training dataset any subjects who were also scanned in the test dataset and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the original features (feature numbers can be reduced from 1440 to 42e44 in the training dataset; the feature numbers can be found in Table S10). To evaluate whether the identified WM features are suitable for the early diagnosis of AD, we also used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to solve binary classification problems (NC vs aMCI, NC vs AD, aMCI vs AD groups).\nThe classification results were evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) based on the three cross validation methods described above. The diagnostic capabilities of the features used were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (Abraham et al., 2017;Feng et al., 2018;Rozycki et al., 2018).",

Furthermore, we selected the points that were significantly different along the entire tract among the NC, aMCI and AD groups. Their mean values and correlations with MMSE scores were analyzed using the same method.\nTo assess the clinical relevance of the diffusion indicatorbased classification, we calculated Pearsons correlations between the classifier output and cognitive ability scores MMSE, AVLT-Immediate Recall, AVLT-Delayed Recall, AVLT-Recognition (primary words) and AVLT-Recognition (new words) scores of individual participants in the test set. Individual pseudoprobabilities were obtained by converting the distances of the test samples from the discrimination hyperplane using sigmoid fits (Rozycki et al., 2018). To evaluate disease severity-associated alterations, we calculated the distance to the discrimination hyperplane, which was used to distinguish AD patients from NCs as the classifier output of each participant with aMCI, for patients with aMCI in the related test datasets.",

More significant group differences were detected for MD profiles in the left and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), left uncinate and left arcuate fasciculus (Fig. 3) than for FA measures. The RD and AxD profiles showed a similar pattern of alterations in the same tracts and regions as MD (Figures S1eS3, Tables S3eS5).\nMore importantly, the present study found moderate positive correlations between cognitive ability scores (MMSE) and the average FA in the aMCI and AD groups for the following tracts: the left cingulum cingulate (r ¼ .54; p  .001) and the right cingulum cingulate (r ¼ .45; p  .001) (Fig. 4 and Table S2).

In addition, we achieved roughly the same correlation results in further correlation analysis of the average of the points showing significant differences among the three groups. More importantly, a similar pattern was identified in the replicated dataset (Tables S2eS9). Correlations between the average WM quantitative measures (FA, MD, AxD, and RD) of tracts and cognitive ability scores AVLT-Immediate Recall, AVLT-Delayed Recall, AVLT-Recognition (primary words) and AVLT-Recognition (new words) were also obtained (Tables S11e14). Briefly, AVLT-delayed recall performance showed significant correlations with FA (MD and RD) in the bilateral cingulum cingulate and callosum forceps minor in the AD and MCI groups in both the discovery and replicated datasets (all p  .05). AVLT-Recognition (new words) performance revealed a significant correlation with the FA (MD and RD) in the callosum forceps minor in the AD and MCI groups in both the discovery and replicated datasets (all p  .05) (Tables S11e14).\nNotably, not all identified regions demonstrated significant correlations between cognitive scores and average WM quantitative measures, and the delayed recall and new word recognition tests were more sensitive than the immediate recall and primary word recognition tests for both the discovery and replicated datasets (Tables S11e14). These findings may reflect impaired microstructure in the brain, which may lead to worse cognitive performance among AD and MCI individuals.",

Interclassification performance was investigated using the discovery and replicated data as an independent training or test set, and we removed the participants included in the two independent datasets from the training set. The intra-(only the LOOCV result) and interclassification results based on different machine learning methods are detailed in Table 2. The SVM provided the best performance among the included methods; hence, we provide results based on the SVM below. As illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table 2, for the discovery dataset, the accuracy was 82.56 (SPE ¼ 79.49, SEN ¼ 85.11, AUC ¼ .89) when we evaluated performance with respect to distinguishing AD patients from The two datasets were acquired from the same department of radiology, and the protocol and parameters used in the MRI examinations were all consistent and differed only in the participants and MR system.

Moreover, the accuracy remained higher than 80 with independent intercenter cross validation of the two datasets (Table 2 and Fig. 5). These ratios were reduced by approximately 5e20 for all metrics using the same features to distinguish aMCI patients from NCs or AD patients from aMCI patients (Fig. 5). In particular, independent cross validation showed that aMCI patients can be distinguished from AD patients with an accuracy of approximately 75, whereas the accuracy was only approximately 59 when distinguishing aMCI patients from NCs based on the SVM method (Table 2, Fig. 5). The additional analyses with the LDA and XGBoost models showed similar but lower performance for distinguishing aMCI patients from AD patients (Table 2). Additional machine learning methods are still needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity.\nTo investigate the relationship between the classification probability and cognitive ability, we performed Pearsons correlation analysis between the classification output and MMSE scores in the aMCI, AD and aMCI plus AD groups in both the discovery and replicated datasets.

      "text": "One of the major aims of clinical neuroimaging is to identify measurements that can facilitate accurate early diagnosis, characterize clinical conditions or predict disease progression. MCI, especially amnestic MCI, is associated with an approximately 20e40 risk of dementia compared to 1e2 in unimpaired elderly individuals (Rami et al., 2007;Ritchie, 2004;Roberts et al., 2014). During the slow progression of the disease, pathophysiological abnormalities, Ab-and tau-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline can develop (Jack et al., 2017;Jack  Holtzman, 2013;Sperling et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2019). Early diagnosis of ADMCI is very important for treatment research and patient care purposes. The development of DTI, which is sensitive to microstructural WM changes that are not visible with conventional volumetric techniques, may contribute to the search for early in vivo biomarkers (Weston et al., 2015).\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate and validate the integrity of whole-brain WM structures using a recently established method called AFQ in participants with AD and aMCI in two independent datasets. In addition, this is the first study to evaluate the possibility of early detection of AD based on whole-brain WM structures using independent cross validation. Impairment-and disease severity-associated patterns provide consistent evidence of widespread patterns of structural deficits in ADaMCI. Application of the most common machine learning SVM method based on imaging features yielded high classification performance, which indicated that microstructural WM signatures have the potential to become a quantitative imaging biomarker for ADaMCI. This comprehensive investigation of whole-brain disruptions offers valuable findings pertaining to AD and broader investigations of WM structural networks. Importantly, these procedures were reproducible and robust, and they thus have translational potential for ADaMCI.",

      "text": "Reproducible impairment-and disease severityassociated patterns in AD and aMCI Over the past decade, converging evidence has suggested that patients with AD exhibit spatial and temporal changes in WM loss, which manifest both microstructurally and macrostructurally; the results of related studies are summarized in several extensive reviews and meta-analyses (Mak et al., 2017;Sexton et al., 2011).\nIn line with previous studies (Jin et al., 2017;Mito et al., 2018), our results revealed reproducible selective degeneration along fiber tract-specific pathways in ADaMCI. In particular, we found degeneration of the fibers of the bilateral cingulum cingulate, ILF, SLF, callosum forceps minor, IFOF, uncinate fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus. As suggested by a number of previous studies, these fiber pathways connect brain regions that have previously been considered functionally impaired and show structural degeneration in AD. For example, the integrity of the cingulum fibers, which connect the medial temporal lobe and the posterior cingulate, is reportedly compromised in the early stage of AD (Catani, Howard, Pajevic,  Jones, 2002;Wakana, Jiang, Nagae-Poetscher, van Zijl,  Mori, 2004). The callosum forceps minor, which is the anterior part of the corpus callosum, connects the homologous regions of the anterior frontal lobes between the two hemispheres (Fame, MacDonald,  Macklis, 2011;Paul et al., 2007). The IFOF connects the occipital lobe and frontal lobe and contains fibers that connect the frontal lobe with the posterior part of the parietal and temporal lobes (Taoka et al., 2006). The IFOF is reportedly associated with emotion, object recognition, cognitive function, and visual processing (Chanraud, Zahr, Sullivan,  Pfefferbaum, 2010), and these daily functional abilities are significantly decreased with diffusion abnormalities in AD (Fellgiebel et al., 2008). Notably, the present study showed that the most severe alterations in AD occur in the middle and posterior parts of this fiber tract, which may explain why information transfer between the visual cortex and frontal and temporal cortices is impaired in AD even in the early stage of MCI (Albers et al., 2015). The uncinate fasciculus connects the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior part of the temporal lobe and plays an important role in memory and cognition (Highley, Walker, Esiri, Crow,  Harrison, 2002). AD-associated abnormalities in the uncinate fasciculus have also been confirmed by previous related studies (Taoka et al., 2006). In AD, WM alterations within the uncinate fasciculus are related to temporal thinning, and disruption of the structural connectivity of mnemonic pathways has been observed (Delli Pizzi et al., 2015). Furthermore, most of these alterations in WM properties correlated significantly with cognitive abilities measured by the MMSE in the AD and aMCI groups. Thus, the present study provides additional evidence for a structural basis of theories of large-scale network disconnection in AD (Liu et al., 2014;Mito et al., 2018;Taylor et al., 2017). In fact, voxel-based analyses have revealed WM degeneration in the cingulum, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculi, temporal lobe, and thalamus in patients with AD (Xie et al., 2006;Yin et al., 2015). Most importantly, the results were reproducible in an independent dataset, which increases confidence in the findings and generalizability to the general population.\nThe exact pathological mechanisms leading to microstructural WM alterations in symptomatic AD patients are not yet fully understood. The present study investigated structural alterations based on the four most commonly used WM quantitative measures (FA, MD, AxD, and RD) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. From a neuroimaging perspective, FA is a scalar value representing anisotropic water diffusion, which can reflect the degree of the directionality of anisotropy of a diffusion process. MD is a scalar value representing the mean water diffusion at each voxel (Le Bihan et al., 2001). AxD describes diffusivity along the principal eigenvector and is thought to be related to axon degeneration. In contrast, RD represents an average of the eigenvectors perpendicular to the principal direction and seems to be modulated by myelin (Song et al., 2002). Compared with NCs, patients with AD exhibited significantly reduced FA and increased axial, radial and mean diffusivities in widespread WM fibers in the discovery and replicate datasets. The lower FA and higher MD, RD and AxD values possibly reflect alterations in axon myelination and fiber organization in WM pathways in AD (Kantarci et al., 2017;Stebbins  Murphy, 2009). In addition, the present results are supported by two recent studies using a similar method (Jin et al., 2017;Mito et al., 2018). Briefly, Jin and colleagues employed an automated clustering algorithm (autoMATE) and found that widespread reduced FA and increased MD on 18 major WM tracts in patient groups may reflect diffuse abnormalities of myelin orand fiber axons in AD (Jin et al., 2017). Based on the FBA method, Mito and colleagues revealed significant WM loss at both microstructural and macrostructural levels in patients with AD, which was evident in specific fiber pathways associated with the default network node (Mito et al., 2018). Consistent with these studies, the present study provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of AD on WM integrity. Taken together, the findings indicate that diffusion measures can be used as early predictors of future cognitive decline and the development of AD, as confirmed by further exploration of the classification.",

      "text": "Neuroimaging has provided promising tools to measure pathological brain changes associated with AD in vivo (Abi-Dargham  Horga, 2016;Ewers et al., 2011;Woo, Chang, Lindquist,  Wager, 2017;Zhao et al., 2020), and several previous studies have suggested that DTI measures may be useful for distinguishing AD patients from NCs (for a review, see Rathore et al., 2017). For example, Mesrob et al. (2012) reported approximately 70 accuracy with the SVM classifier and ROI-based DTI indices for 15 AD and 16 HC subjects. By combining DTI indices with the gray matter volume derived from sMRI, Dyrba and colleagues achieved approximately 85 accuracy in distinguishing 28 AD patients from 25 HCs (Dyrba et al., 2015). An important novel feature of the present study is that we identified and reproduced the impaired WM patterns in ADaMCI in two independent datasets. Biomarker validation, which conventionally entails comparison of a prediction with an actual outcome, is one of the challenges of developing imaging biomarkers for brain diseases (Abi-Dargham  Horga, 2016;Jack  Holtzman, 2013;Smith  Nichols, 2018;Zhao et al., 2020). The ability to reproduce cross validation for independent datasets is a key part of the scientific caliber of the present study with respect to identifying imaging-based biomarkers (Naci  Ioannidis, 2015). These findings provide evidence for WM quantitative measures that generalize across studies, which indicate that the classification model will generalize well to an independent cohort.\nOver the past decades, many studies have integrated a range of MRI measures into signatures of AD using machine learning techniques for individualized diagnosis and prognosis establishment (Jagust, 2018;Rathore et al., 2017;Schouten et al., 2017). The AFQ pipeline provided anatomically precise, tract-specific results and revealed broad increases in FA and decreases in MD, RD and AxD in AD. Further correlation analyses suggest that these alterations are associated with cognitive ability and are reproducible at the group level. However, these alterations cannot serve as imaging biomarkers for individual participants. The multivariate classification and cross-site validation results based on WM structures indicated that fiber markers may be available for widespread use in the future. The central goal of translational neuroimaging is to develop reliable and valid imaging paradigms and establish robust links between brain measures and clinical output (Reddan, Lindquist,  Wager, 2017;Zhao et al., 2020). Importantly, the significant correlations between the classification output and cognitive ability in the present study well support this key, especially the independent intercenter cross validation results demonstrating that microstructural measures are potential imaging biomarkers for AD.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "Nevertheless, several limitations in the present study should be considered. First, the cross-sectional study design without Ab or tau measures may have resulted in misdiagnosis of some participants (Jack et al., 2018) and reduced power to describe WM degenerative changes over the course of the disease. However, replication of the results can partly remedy this flaw. Earlier in vivo signs may provide information that helps to defer the onset, slow the progression, or improve the symptoms of AD. Future studies should evaluate whether multimodal imaging (for example, functional and structural) methods, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) measures and Ab and tau measurements combined with other techniques (such as virtual reality) can further increase the diagnostic accuracy for AD. Second, similar to other whole-brain fiber analysis methods, such as TRACULA (Yendiki et al., 2011) and FBA (Raffelt et al., 2017), AFQ has the following benefits: (1) the method overcomes the limitations related to manual interaction and is thus fully automatic and can be applied to large datasets; and (2) the method measures pointwise diffusion profiles along tracts of interest and can detect subtle changes in WM integrity (Yeatman et al., 2012(Yeatman et al., , 2018)).\nRegardless, the present study based on the AFQ method is limited to major WM tracts, and some small but useful tracts may have been overlooked. Another limitation of AFQ is that fiber tracts may not follow the true brain information transfer pathways due to limitations of tractography parameters (such as turning angles and stopping criteria) (Yeatman et al., 2018). In the future, more advanced algorithms will be incorporated to increase the accuracy of the AFQ method. Third, the present study investigated only WM properties within main fibers; VBA, TBSS, atlas-based measures or 3D tract-specific analysis can provide more features that will be incorporated into our pipeline to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity or predictive power of classification analyses (Maier-Hein et al., 2017). Fourth, the present study adopted deterministic tractography, which is typically available in clinical settings, and we may need to consider probabilistic tractography to develop multishell multitissue imaging methods in the future (Maier-Hein et al., 2017;Sarwar, Ramamohanarao,  Zalesky, 2019).\nFinally, the present study investigated only two available datasets (more than 240 participants). Although the results are robust and exciting, the ability to identify weak diseaseassociated alterations may require further verification due to the relatively small sample size. Thus, establishing valid, reliable cross validation results is crucial (Dyrba et al., 2013;Nir, Jahanshad, et al., 2015;Wee et al., 2011). Notably, the accuracy of the three traditional classification methods (SVM, LDA and XGBoost) was not particularly high, which is consistent with previous related studies, and better classification performance may be achieved via parameter tuning, feature digging steps, or other methods such as deep learning. However, this may lead to overfitting or reduced generalizability of the model to data from a new independent (Davatzikos et al., 2019;Rozycki et al., 2018). It should also be noted that there was relatively low sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing aMCI patients from AD patients or NCs. One potential reason for this is that aMCI patients do not exhibit significant alterations in brain WM structures. Another potential reason is the large variances between samples from independent scanners. More advanced machine learning models, more samples from different sites and better pooling analysis methods may improve the statistical power of the analysis, allowing scientists to explore more information that cannot be evaluated in smaller datasets (Woo et al., 2017).",

    "abstract": "The volume reduction of the gray matter structures in patients with Alzheimers disease is often accompanied by an asymmetric increase in the number of white matter fibers located close to these structures. The present study aims to investigate the white matter structure changes in the motor basal ganglia in Alzheimers disease patients compared to healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging. The amounts of tracts, tract length, tract volume, quantitative anisotropy, and general fractional anisotropy were measured in ten patients with Alzheimers disease and ten healthy controls. A significant decrease in the number of tracts and general fractional anisotropy was found in patients with Alzheimers disease compared to controls in the right caudate nucleus, while an increase was found in the left and the right putamen. Further, a significant decrease in the structural volume of the left and the right putamen was observed. An increase in the white matter diffusion tensor imaging parameters in patients with Alzheimers disease was observed only in the putamen bilaterally. The right caudate showed a decrease in both the diffusion tensor imaging parameters and the volume in Alzheimers disease patients. The right pallidum showed an increase in the diffusion tensor imaging parameters but a decrease in volume in Alzheimers disease patients.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Structural changes of the basal ganglia (BG) are typically the domain of the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Conversely, there are not many studies of the white matter (WM) changes around the principal BG (e.g., putamen, caudate and pallidum) in Alzheimers disease (AD). In a three-year longitudinal study of AD, unilateral atrophy in the right caudate nucleus and bilateral atrophy in the putamen was reported 1. However, after the progression of AD over time this atrophy was also found in the left caudate nucleus 1. Besides the morphological changes, the differences in the BG perfusion were also found in AD. For example, hyperperfusion in the right putamen and in the head of the right caudate nucleus was observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in AD 2. Thus, it is plausible that changes in the perfusion of the BG may lead with time to hypo-or hypertrophy of the WM located nearby 3,4. Even though these changes in the perfusion may be typical for vascular dementia, hyper-perfusion could lead to the opposite effect, such as an increase in the structural and functional parameters. In the carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele with AD, the regional blood supply to many areas of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures was significantly and asymmetrically reduced. 5.\nBoth diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are promising methods that can be used to assess the microstructure of axonal bundles and depict the axonal integrity of both normal and pathological brain tracts based on the diffusion properties of the brain tissue 6.\nIn our previous study 7, we found a significant reduction in the diffusion tensor imaging parameters in the fornix of AD patients compared to controls, likely due to neuronal degeneration and white matter loss. However, we simultaneously observed a surprising increase in values of tractographic parameters in the subcallosal area and the paraterminal gyrus in the patients with AD compared to the control group. Our explanation was that the patients with AD compensate for the loss of the ability to consolidate memory by redirecting and utilizing other structures, such as the subcallosal area and the paraterminal gyrus, especially if the fornix fibers are affected at the same time.\nGiven our previous data on DTI-based tractography demonstrating asymmetrical compensatory changes in the white matter structure of the subcallosal area and the paraterminal gyrus in AD patients, the present research aimed to determine whether there are compensatory changes in the findings related to the white matter diffusion tensor imaging data in the motor basal ganglia of the AD patients compared to the healthy controls. Our hypothesis was that the AD patients would show an increase in the DTI parameters (NT andor QA) in some but not all of the BG compared to the healthy controls.",

    "SubjectsParticipants": {
      "text": "In this study, we recruited 10 patients with a confirmed AD diagnosis and 10 healthy controls (Table 1). MRI and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) tests were performed on all subjects at the Alzheimers Disease Center, Department of Neurology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. For the purpose of the study, we used two groups of participants: (1) patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia caused by AD according to NIA-AA criteria 8,9 and (2) cognitively normal older adults. At the beginning of the study, there was a separate third MCI patient group, which was classified as the AD group later since all the MCI group participants got diagnosed with AD by the end of the study. The AD diagnosis was made by an experienced neurologist through a thorough neurological and neuropsychological examination, functional assessments, blood work-up, brain MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and measurements of the total and phosphorylated tau proteins as well as β-amyloid peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid upon the patients consent to a lumbar puncture 10. Most patients with the diagnosis were followed up for several years before they showed a cognitive and functional decline. Adults (controls) with normal cognitive abilities were recruited for the study at the University of the Third Age (adult education courses) of the Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Czech Republic. These had normal MMSE scores (given recent Czech norms and limits) for mild AD 11. In the control group, only those who were over 70 years of age were selected in order to stay consistent with the age of the AD patients. For a more detailed description, see our previous article 6. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Prague Psychiatric CenterNational Institute of Mental Health and the Human Ethics Committee of the Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, (Protocol No. 20163), and informed consent was obtained for all patients according to the Declaration of Helsinki.",

The two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was applied for the analysis of the two independent groups (the AD patients and controls) and the two dependent variables (the left and the right side). The Wilks lambda test was used to evaluate the differences between the AD and control groups with the left and right sides as variables for both the DTI analysis and the FreeSurfer volumetric analysis (Tables 2 and3). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between the measures taken for the same person at different locations (Figure 1). Subsequently, we tested the differences in these correlations computed in the AD and control groups separately, using the Fisher z-transform 17 and the two-sided test (for which we cite p-values). In particular, we tested the AD versus control difference in correlations for both the number of tracts and the connectivity characteristics, comparing-(i) the laterality (correlating the left and the right value of the same patient) of the putamen, pallidum, and the caudate, (ii) the structure (correlating the putamen, pallidum, and the caudate, separately for the left and right hemisphere), and then (iii) the structure segmentation volume (correlating the brain segmentation volumes in the putamen, pallidum, and the caudate, separately for the left and right hemisphere), plus (iv) the number of tractsconnectivity related to the volume of the putamen, pallidum, and the caudate. We acknowledge that different characteristics (like the number of tracts on the left and on the left) might be, to some extent, correlated. The volume datasets from the FS program were extracted, converted into Excel spreadsheets, and subsequently processed in the STATISTICA software.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "DTI is challenging, and the fiber tract reconstruction depends on the quality of the diffusion data. The theoretical basics and a number of factors influencing the reconstruction results are covered in the literature 18,19.\nFor example, the gradient field inhomogeneity causes artifacts that affect the results of the reconstructed fibers. The gradient field can be efficiently mapped using the b-matrix spatial distribution in DTI (BSD-DTI) technique to correct the magnitude and the direction of the diffusion gradient 20.\nIn our study, the nQA parameter has been used for the fiber tracking (FT) instead of the FA due to the fact that QA-aided tractography has reached a better resolution and is less sensitive to partial volume effects of the crossing fibers than the tractography based on the FA 21. FA is defined for all the fiber populations within a voxel and suffers from the partial volume effect.\nTherefore, the data were reconstructed using the DSI studio with the GQI method. GQI is a free model that can be applied to any diffusion scheme that provides a quantitative anisotropy (QA) parameter, which is based on the spin distribution function (SDF) of diffusing water at different orientations. QA measures the spin density of anisotropy along a fiber pathway for each fiber population and contributes to more reliable tractography. QA can be normalized (nQA), which stabilizes the proton density across subjects 22.\nAn increase in values of the quantitative DTI parameters in the WM of the AD patients was observed only in the left and the right putamen, while their volumes were reduced compared to the controls. The right caudate showed, as expected, a decrease in both the DTI parameters and the volume in the AD patients compared to the controls. The right pallidum showed, similarly to the putamen, an increase in the DTI parameters but a decrease in volume in the AD patients compared to the controls.\nAn increase in the values of the quantitative DTI parameters of the WM observed in AD patients suggests the plasticity of specific tracts. The question is whether the whole process should be labeled as degeneration. Deposition of the amyloid plaques and deposits is typically present at the inferior part of the temporal lobe and the posterior cingulum 10,23. These are also anatomical targets of the projections that undergo the WM hypertrophy or increase in the tract fibers on the DTI.\nWhy is there a decrease in the number of tracts in the caudate nucleus but an increase in the pallidum and the putamen? When considering the loops of the BG circuits, the motor loop skips the caudate nucleus but not the pallidum and the putamen. On the contrary, the executiveassociative loop of the BG skips the putamen but deploys the caudate nucleus 24. Since the motor skills are not affected in the early and mid-stages of AD, while cognition and memory decline, the observed compensatory WM hypertrophy in the putamen and the pallidum does not seem to be effective even though it is present. Since the caudate nucleus inhibits the pallidum, the increase in the WM of the pallidum could be due to its spontaneous activation after the caudate atrophies.\nGiven that the caudate is evolutionarily older compared to the relatively younger putamen 25, we hypothesize that the caudate could be the first to suffer the loss of structure and function. Thus, the putamen may not undergo neurodegeneration so easily; it could stay intact for longer and may, to some extent, substitute for the loss of function of the caudate. However, the observed caudateputamen volume ratio in early caudate dysfunction in PD patients suggests this is not the case 26. Although the WM compensatory changes in AD on the DTI were not described frequently, they were observed in PD 27, Tourettes syndrome 28, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder 29,30. Interestingly, increased connectivity in the right caudate nucleus was observed in cognitively normal PD patients 31.\nRecently, we proposed that an increase in values of the quantitative DTI parameters of the WM in the subcallosal area and the paraterminal gyrus is an aftermath of the hippocampal atrophy 7,32. We now propose another structuralfunctional compensatory mechanism for hippocampal atrophy in AD in terms of the BG white matter volume increase. The reason for this compensatory hypertrophy could be their participation in the association loop of the BG circuit (association cortex-BG-thalamus-cortex). This circuit is responsible not only for motor skills but also for memory formation (emotional memory and positive reward reaction, episodic memory, and association cortices bound to memory formation).\nIn AD, attention has been paid to the brain areas with clinically proven morphological atrophy (the hippocampus, various cortical areas, the brain stem, and others). Recently, there were attempts to include clinical diagnostics and atrophy of neuroanatomical heterogeneous areas, i.e., basal forebrain cholinergic system 33.\nWe suggest another option: what if there are numerous compensatory shifts in motorassociationsensory and other brain structures, including the tracts in AD patients, detectable on the DTI (such as NT, TL, TV, QA, and GFA) that manifests by default when the atrophied primary memory circuits fail to work properly?\nLimitations of the study: A small sample size (10 subjects) of our study represents some limitations; the observed asymmetric changes may be the result of a small sample, and further study with more patients is needed to confirm our conclusions. White matter changes around the basal ganglia were not specifically parcellated into the afferents or the efferents, nor were they classified into any kind of intrinsic or extrinsic projections in regards to the cortex, the brain stem, or the diencephalon. This way, it was compared only to the sum of three-directional projections between the AD patients and the controls. For future research it would be good to compare the DTI-based tractography of separate tracts and pathways of the BG in AD patients and controls, the cortical ones in particular.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "Our data show there is an asymmetrical increase in the DTI parameters in patients with AD, which is consistent with our hypothesis stating that the same pattern may appear in other brain areas as well (which has not been proven yet). More specifically, a decrease in the volume of the left and the right putamen in the AD patients compared to controls was expected when measured by the FS. Interestingly, there was an increase in the NT in their proximity. If this was the effect of the compensatory changes (i.e., reduced volume of the structure and an increase in the amount of the WM fibers around it), then it remains unclear why the pallidum or caudate would not show a similar compensatory effect as well. Moreover, the timing of these changes remains unclear. Do they arrive prior to the decrease in the volume of the putamen and the increase in the white matter NT follows, or is it the other way around? Or rather, do all the changes occur relatively simultaneously?",

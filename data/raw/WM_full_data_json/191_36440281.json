    "abstract": "Background: Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) is a promising diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) marker that shows consistent and strong cognitive associations in the context of different cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD). Purpose: Investigate whether PSMD (1) is higher in patients with Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) than those with arteriolosclerosis; (2) can capture the anteroposterior distribution of CAA-related abnormalities; (3) shows similar neuroimaging and cognitive associations in comparison to other classical DTI markers, such as average mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). Materials and methods: We analyzed cross-sectional neuroimaging and neuropsychological data from 90 non-demented memory-clinic subjects from a single center. Based on MRI findings, we classified them into probable-CAA (those that fulfilled the modified Boston criteria), subjects with MRI markers of cSVD not attributable to CAA (presumed arteriolosclerosis; cSVD), Frontiers in Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org Zanon Zotin et al. 10.3389fnins.2022.1051038 and subjects without evidence of cSVD on MRI (non-cSVD). We compared total and lobe-specific (frontal and occipital) DTI metrics values across the groups. We used linear regression models to investigate how PSMD, MD, and FA correlate with conventional neuroimaging markers of cSVD and cognitive scores in CAA. Results: PSMD was comparable in probable-CAA (median 4.06  10 -4 mm 2 s) and cSVD (4.07  10 -4 mm 2 s) patients, but higher than in non-cSVD (3.30  10 -4 mm 2 s; p  0.001) subjects. Occipital-frontal PSMD gradients were higher in probable-CAA patients, and we observed a significant interaction between diagnosis and region on PSMD values F(2, 87)  3.887, p  0.024. PSMD was mainly associated with white matter hyperintensity volume, whereas MD and FA were also associated with other markers, especially with the burden of perivascular spaces. PSMD correlated with worse executive function (β  -0.581, p  0.001) and processing speed (β  -0.463, p  0.003), explaining more variance than other MRI markers. MD and FA were not associated with performance in any cognitive domain. Conclusion: PSMD is a promising biomarker of cognitive impairment in CAA that outperforms other conventional and DTI-based neuroimaging markers. Although global PSMD is similarly increased in different forms of cSVD, PSMDs spatial variations could potentially provide insights into the predominant type of underlying microvascular pathology.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a form of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) related to the deposition of amyloidbeta around cortical and leptomeningeal vessels (Viswanathan and Greenberg, 2011). CAA is highly prevalent among older individuals and impacts cognition independently from commonly co-occurring Alzheimers disease (AD) (Arvanitakis et al., 2011). CAA has thus emerged as an important vascular contributor to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), even in the absence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (Xiong et al., 2017).\nIn order to facilitate the future development of diseasemodifying therapies for VCID, it has become paramount to validate neuroimaging markers able to quantify the widespread parenchymal injury associated with cSVD (Smith et al., 2019). Among the many MRI markers available, those based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provide more consistent cognitive associations due to their continuous quantitative nature and higher sensitivity to microstructural abnormalities (Smith and Beaudin, 2018).\nA novel DTI marker called peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) is considered particularly promising in the field of VCID (Baykara et al., 2016). PSMD is a fully automated histogram marker that reflects the heterogeneity of the mean diffusivity (MD) values across the main white matter (WM) tracts. It was developed to quantify the WM injury related to VCID and has provided consistent cognitive associations in several populations, especially among cohorts with cSVD (Baykara et al., 2016;Deary et al., 2019;Lam et al., 2019;Wei et al., 2019;Low et al., 2020;McCreary et al., 2020;Raposo et al., 2021). According to previous data, PSMD correlates with processing speed scores in CAA samples and could become a relevant marker for CAA-related cognitive impairment (McCreary et al., 2020;Raposo et al., 2021).\nHowever, several questions concerning the utility of this marker in the field of CAA remain unanswered. In general, PSMD values found in samples with cSVD are higher than those with predominantly neurodegenerative pathology. However, it remains unknown whether PSMD values vary significantly across different forms of sporadic cSVD. Regional analyses with PSMD are thought to be feasible (Beaudet et al., 2020), and lobe-specific PSMD values have been successfully computed in a previous study (Low et al., 2020). However, no studies to date have investigated spatial variations in PSMD values in the context of CAA. Specifically, it is unknown whether PSMD could capture the posterior predominance of CAA pathology, like other diffusion techniques (Reijmer et al., 2015a). Furthermore, only one study in CAA has compared PSMD with other classical DTI markers in terms of cognitive and neuroimaging associations (McCreary et al., 2020), but the extent to which this new marker outperforms MD and fractional anisotropy (FA) remains uncertain.\nIn this context, our aims were: (1) to compare PSMD values in different MRI phenotypes of sporadic cSVDs and in subjects without evidence of cSVD on MRI; (2) to investigate whether the posterior predominance of CAA pathology is reflected on regional variations of PSMD values; (3) to investigate PSMDs cognitive and neuroimaging associations in CAA, compared to other DTI-based MRI markers.",

      "text": "This study is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing single-center prospective memory-clinic research cohort from the MGH. Subjects were recruited between August 2010 and November 2019.\nWe included non-demented subjects aged 55 years or more with complete clinical evaluation, neuropsychological examination, and 3 T MRI. Exclusion criteria were: dementia (defined as Mini Mental State Examination MMSE  24 andor impairment of independent activities of daily living IADs); a history of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); incomplete neuropsychological examination andor research MRI; and presence of motion or other artifacts compromising neuroimaging assessment. To avoid diagnostic uncertainty, we also excluded subjects with a single hemorrhagic MRI marker fulfilling the modified Boston criteria (Linn et al., 2010) for possible-CAA and those with mixed-pattern of hemorrhages (Pasi et al., 2018). Based on the examination of MR images for conventional neuroimaging markers of cSVD, and according to the modified Boston criteria (Linn et al., 2010), we stratified the participants into three groups: probable-CAA (patients fulfilling Boston criteria for probable CAA); cSVD subjects not fulfilling criteria for either possible or probable CAA and presenting one or more of the other following MRI markers of cSVD: non-lobar cerebral microbleeds CMB, andor lacunes, andor high-grade (2) basal ganglia perivascular spaces (PVS) (Potter et al., 2015), andor deep Fazekas score (Fazekas et al., 1987)  2 andor periventricular Fazekas score Fazekas et al. (1987)  3; and non-cSVD (subjects without any of the above neuroimaging markers of cSVD). None of the cSVD subjects had any MRI or clinical features suggesting a hereditarymonogenic pathology. Therefore, they are presumably affected by the most prevalent etiological subtype of sporadic cSVD, related to aging andor vascular risk factors such as hypertension (arteriolosclerosisdeep perforator arteriopathy).",

To objectively and quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of head motion during the acquisition of DWI images, we further extracted registration-and intensity-based measures to compute the Total Motion Index (TMI) proposed by Yendiki et al. (2014). TMI was originally developed to be used as a nuisance regressor to account for motion confounding in neuroimaging studies (Yendiki et al., 2014). Since the intensitybased measures did not show significant variability across our subjects, only the registration-based measures were applied in the TMI formula.\nWe ran the fully automated PSMD script (version 1.02016) 1 (Baykara et al., 2016), including all the pre-processing steps, relying on the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) version 6.0.1 (Jenkinson et al., 2012). Briefly, the script runs motion and eddy-currents correction (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2015), brain extraction (Smith, 2002), and tensor fitting as pre-processing steps, obtaining maps of MD and FA. These maps are fed into tractbased spatial statistics (TBSS), as implemented in FSL (Smith et al., 2006), to achieve skeletonization of the main WM tracts. The obtained skeletonized MD maps are further masked with a custom mask to exclude areas prone to CSF contamination. Finally, a histogram analysis is conducted on the final MD maps, and the difference between percentiles 5 and 95 is computed to obtain PSMD values for each individual. Similar procedures were used to compute skeletonized average MD (McCreary et al., 2020) and FA values.",

CMBs were evaluated on SWI for presence, number, and location (Wardlaw et al., 2013). Lacunes were evaluated on FLAIR images as lesions measuring 3-15 mm, isointense to CSF, with hyperintense margins (Wardlaw et al., 2013). We evaluated SWI for the presence of cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) (Linn et al., 2010). Cortical cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs), defined as lesions 4 mm, restricted to the cortex, hypointense on T1, and hyperintense on FLAIR, were counted across the whole brain (van Veluw et al., 2017). We rated PVS in the centrum semiovale (CSO-PVS) and the basal ganglia (BG-PVS), using T1-weighted images, according to a previously proposed scale: 0 (none); 1 (1-10); 2 (11-20); 3 (21-40); 4 (40) (Potter et al., 2015). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were qualitatively assessed using a validated visual scale (Fazekas et al., 1987).\nWe used the FreeSurfer software suite (version 6.0)2 (Dale et al., 1999) to compute total brain volume (TBV) and total intracranial volume (ICV), following a rigorous visual quality inspection. The normalized TBV (nTBV) was calculated as the TBVICV ratio multiplied by 100, and was expressed in units of percent ICV. We used the lesion prediction algorithm (Schmidt, 2017) implemented in the toolbox Lesion Segmentation Tool version 3.0.03 for Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 to segment WM hyperintense lesions, following visual inspection for segmentation quality. Different lesion probability thresholds were evaluated on 40 randomly selected individuals from our cohort, and the ideal threshold of 0.5 was defined by careful visual inspection against their respective FLAIR images for accuracy.

Since cognitive scores had already been adjusted for age, gender, and education level, we did not include these variables in the models. We further assessed the relative contribution of each neuroimaging variable by running multiple linear regression models and applying a decomposition method proposed by Lindeman et al. (1980) and available in the Relaimpo R package (v2.2) (Grömping, 2006).\nNon-parametric variables were log-transformed for the regional analyses. To investigate regional variances in PSMD, MD, and FA we compared occipital-frontal gradients between the groups, using ANCOVA, adjusting for age. Furthermore, to evaluate whether CAA diagnosis could influence regional variances in DTI metrics, we compared probable-CAA subjects against non-cSVD and cSVD subjects. We used mixed-factor ANOVA to investigate whether there was an interaction between group and region on PSMD, MD, and FA values. We further investigated the simple main effects of group and region using ANCOVA adjusted for age and repeated-measures ANOVA, respectively. All pairwise comparisons were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.\nThe statistical significance level was set at 0.05 for all analyses.

Second, taking a regional approach, we observed higher occipital-frontal PSMD gradients in probable-CAA than non-cSVD and cSVD subjects and found a significant interaction between diagnosis and regional PSMD variation.

PSMD values in probable-CAA and cSVD subjects from our study are comparable to those previously reported in other cSVD samples: CADASIL (4.5-5.47  10 4 mm 2 s) (Baykara et al., 2016;Vinciguerra et al., 2018), memory-clinic subjects with sporadic cSVD (4.24  10 4 mm 2 s) (Baykara et al., 2016), and subjects with WM lesions and VCID (4.51  10 4 mm 2 s) (Wei et al., 2019). McCreary et al. (2020) reported slightly higher PSMD among 34 CAA subjects (4.97  10 4 mm 2 s), which could be explained by the presence of symptomatic ICH in that cohort. As expected, like other DTI-based techniques, global PSMD values are similar across different cSVD phenotypes and do not appear specific to any WM disease.\nThough PSMD was originally developed as a global measure of WM integrity, our study supports that it can be successfully applied in a spatially oriented way, opening up interesting research possibilities. Expanding on existing research (Beaudet et al., 2020;Low et al., 2020), we calculated lobe-specific measures of PSMD, investigating between-group differences. We found that the degree to which PSMD values increased posteriorly was higher among probable-CAA compared to non-cSVD and cSVD subjects, indicating that there is a significant interaction between diagnosis and anteroposterior PSMD variations. The higher occipital-frontal PSMD gradients observed in the probable-CAA sample suggest that WM microstructural damage may be more severe in the posterior areas of the brain. This is consistent with several histopathological (Vinters and Gilbert, 1983;van Veluw et al., 2019a) and imaging (Smith et al., 2004;Rosand et al., 2005;Thanprasertsuk et al., 2014;Schouten et al., 2019) studies showing a posterior predilection of CAA pathology. This finding reflects a pattern of brain injury consistent with vascular amyloid deposition and could potentially provide insights into the predominant type of underlying microvascular pathology. Interestingly, we did not observe similar findings with MD or FA. That is, occipital-frontal MD and FA gradients did not differ between the groups. We also did not observe a significant interaction between region and group on these classical DTI metrics. Only PSMD displayed a spatial variation in line with the expected anteroposterior gradient of CAA pathology. This finding implies that different DTI metrics could show different sensitivity to underlying pathological changes, and could help explain their contrasting cognitive associations.\nTo further assess whether PSMD captures similar tissue abnormalities compared to average MD and FA, we investigated the relationship between conventional MRI markers of cSVD and each DTI metric. While PSMD is mainly associated with nWMHV, MD and FA strongly correlate with other markers, especially with PVS. Importantly, average MD and FA are central tendency measures, whereas PSMD is a dispersion metric (Beaudet et al., 2020). This difference could potentially explain the distinct neuroimaging associations observed. Furthermore, the degree to which these markers are influenced by specific technical parameters from the DTI protocol, such as the b-value, is uncertain and could potentially impact their ability to detect specific underlying tissue changes (Hui et al., 2010). The strong associations between PVS and classical DTI metrics align with recent observations that MD and FA changes in cSVD are mainly driven by increased water content in the extracellular compartment (named free-water), which includes the perivascular space (Duering et al., 2018). The exclusive and robust relationship between PSMD and non-hemorrhagic markers of cSVD, especially with WMH, has also been reported before (McCreary et al., 2020;Raposo et al., 2021). Ischemic markers are thought to cause structural disruption beyond the core lesions (van Veluw et al., 2017) and have been consistently associated with different DTI measures (Auriel et al., 2014;Reijmer et al., 2015a) and with cognitive function (van Dalen et al., 2015) in other cohorts.\nOther DWI-based measures, like FA, apparent diffusion coefficient, and brain network measures, have been linked to loss of microstructural integrity in CAA (Salat et al., 2006;Viswanathan et al., 2008;Reijmer et al., 2015a), and some were also associated with cognitive performance (Viswanathan et al., 2008;Reijmer et al., 2015a;McCreary et al., 2020). Among these, only brain network analysis has been shown to reflect the anteroposterior gradient of CAA pathology, and, interestingly, it correlated with the same cognitive domains as PSMD (executive function and processing speed) (Reijmer et al., 2015a). These domains are commonly affected in VCID, which could imply that vascular pathology is likely the primary mechanism involved in the diffusion abnormalities captured by PSMD. Though it has been advocated that PSMD could be a specific or exclusive marker of processing speed (Smith and Beaudin, 2018), more recent studies with cSVD samples (Wei et al., 2019) and population-based cohorts (Deary et al., 2019;Low et al., 2020) found associations with other cognitive domains. It is noteworthy that PSMD outperformed both conventional and diffusion-based MRI markers of cSVD in our CAA cohort, which is consistent with findings from other groups (Baykara et al., 2016). Interestingly, in an exploratory analysis, while frontal PSMD values correlated with cognitive performance, occipital PSMD values did not. It is possible that frontal areas could be driving the associations observed between global PSMD and executive functionprocessing speed. This interpretation is in line with studies that support a central role of frontal regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in orchestrating executive functions (Panikratova et al., 2020). Most conventional markers did not correlate with cognition in our sample, adding to their previously reported weak and inconsistent associations (Reijmer et al., 2015b). Though average MD and FA were not associated with cognition in our CAA sample, McCreary et al. (2020) found MD values to be associated with processing speed (p  0.004) in a smaller sample of CAA patients. These conflicting results could potentially be due to the presence of symptomatic ICH in the Canadian cohort, which could significantly impact MD values and their cognitive associations.\nImportantly, PSMDs histopathological correlates have not yet been investigated. van Veluw et al. (2019b) found, in an ex vivo study of CAA patients, that MD values correlate with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and WM microinfarcts. PSMD and mean MD values are both increased in CAA subjects and could reflect somewhat similar histopathological changes (McCreary et al., 2020). However, the distinct neuroimaging associations and spatial variation patterns observed between PSMD, and classical DTI metrics raise the possibility that they might be capturing slightly different histopathological abnormalities. Therefore, future studies investigating PSMDs histological correlates are warranted and could improve the interpretation and biological understanding of this new and promising marker.\nOur study has limitations. First, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference, calling for future longitudinal studies. Second, in this single-center study, we included only non-demented subjects from a memory-clinic setting, which accounts for a very specific CAA-profile and limits generalizability. Nonetheless, we chose to restrict recruitment from stroke-center subjects to avoid combining different phenotypes of CAA (Charidimou et al., 2015) in the same sample. By excluding demented patients, we aimed to capture earlier steps in the evolution of CAA and reduce the influence of concomitant AD pathology in our findings. The unavailability of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) markers precluded a more detailed etiological characterization of the groups, based solely on MRI criteria.",

      "text": "In conclusion, we provided evidence on PSMDs promising role as a measure of both global and regional WM injury in CAA. Although global PSMD values are similarly increased in different forms of cSVD, regional PSMD analyses may capture disease-specific spatial variations. PSMD outperforms conventional and DTI-based markers as a cognitive biomarker in CAA and shows a distinct profile of neuroimaging correlates compared to MD and FA. Future research should investigate PSMDs histopathological correlates and its performance in larger multi-center longitudinal CAA cohorts.",

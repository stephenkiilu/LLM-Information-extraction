    "abstract": "Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline. Although cerebral white matter (WM) damage predicts cognitive function in CAD, conventional neuroimaging measures only partially explain the effect of CAD on cognition. The purpose of this study was to determine if WM microstructural integrity and CAD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) correlates with cognitive function in older adults with CAD. Methods: Forty-nine CAD patients (66 AE 7 years old, 86 male) underwent neurocognitive assessments using the cognitive battery recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeeCanadian Stroke Network for the study of vascular cognitive impairment. Composite scores for each cognitive domain were calculated. Microstructural integrity in normal-appearing WM was quantified as fractional anisotropy (FA) using DTI in nine bilateral and two interhemispheric WM tracts from the Johns Hopkins University WM Tractography Atlas. Linear regression models examined associations between FA and cognitive performance, controlling for age, sex, and education, with correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5. Results: Executive function was most significantly associated with FA in the left parahippocampal cingulum (b ¼ 0.471, t ¼ 3.381, df ¼ 44, p ¼ 0.002) and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (b ¼ 0.430, t ¼ 2.984, df ¼ 44, p ¼ 0.005). FA was not associated with memory in any of the WM tracts examined. Conclusion: These results suggest that WM microstructural integrity may be an important neural correlate of executive function even in cognitively intact CAD patients. This study suggests WM damage may be relevant to subtle cognitive decline in a population that may have early neural risk for dementia. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2015; 23:754e763)",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) and associated vascular risk factors are associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and progression to dementia. 1,2 Among the cognitive domains, executive function has been suggested to be particularly vulnerable in those with CAD. 3,4 However, the contributions of CAD and associated cardiovascular risk factors to cognitive decline in healthy aging remain largely under-recognized in clinical care. 5,6 It is important to examine damage to the cerebral white matter (WM) network in this population because WM damage cannot only predict cognitive decline in older adults 7,8 but also future ischemic strokes and myocardial infarction (MI) in CAD patients. 9 Previous studies have shown that CAD and its associated cardiovascular risk factors are associated with WM damage. 10e12 Disruption of the WM is often characterized as WM hyperintensities (WMHs), which are associated with microvascular injuries 13 and are independently associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and progression to dementia. 14 In a study by Zheng et al. 4 , macrostructural neuroimaging measures, including WMH, did not fully explain the effect of CAD on cognition. Controlling for WMH volumes, CAD remained significantly associated with cognition in older community-dwelling adults. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive technique thought to detect subtle differences in tissue microstructure, and two measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), have been associated with cognitive performance in other populations. These measures are often used as indices of connectivity in the brain. Specifically, lower FA is thought to reflect axonal injury, whereas higher MD is suggested to represent changes in tract integrity due to demyelination. 15 Therefore, DTI assessment of subtle differences in normal-appearing WM (NAWM) and comparison with cognitive performance in CAD are warranted.\nThe present study assesses whether higher FA in the major WM tracts is associated with better performance in executive function in patients with CAD. Additionally, the significance of FA in predicting memory performance and the significance of MD were explored. The aim of the study was to determine whether WM integrity in any of the major tracts could explain the variance in cognitive performance in patients with CAD.",

Verbal memory was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd edition (CVLT-II), which yields a measure of short delay free recall (SDFR) of a word list after 10 minutes and of long delay free recall (LDFR) after 20 minutes. Visuospatial memory was assessed using the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), which yields a measure of total memory recall and of delayed memory recall after 25 minutes. A trained researcher administered the cognitive tests at a standardized time (0930 AE 30 minutes).",

      "text": "Quality control and motion correction were performed on diffusion tensor images using DtiStudio. 18 FA and MD maps were then calculated by averaging multiple acquisitions. DTI maps were then nonlinearly coregistered to the target standard-space image FMRIB58_FA using Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) (http:www.fmrib. ox.ac.ukfsl; Analysis Group, Oxford, England, United Kingdom). Twenty WM tract regions of interest were identified using probability masks from the Johns Hopkins University WM Tractography Atlas. 19 These tracts included nine left and right side bilateral tracts (superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinated fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus temporal region, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, parahippocampal cingulum, cingulum gyrus region, corticospinal tract, and anterior thalamic radiation) and two interhemispheric tracts of the corpus callosum (forceps major and forceps minor). The threshold was set at !20 to minimize capturing minor WM radiations toward the cortex that are sensitive to registration errors.\nWMHs were identified and masked using Lesion Explorer. 20 WMH masks were then transformed to standard space and combined into a sample-wide WMH mask in FSL. Using this combined mask, WMH voxels were removed from WM tract regions of interest to enable the assessment of DTI measures in NAWM only. Finally, mean FA and MD values were calculated for each WM tract region of interest in each participant.",

A principal component analysis was used to confirm the reduction of the individual cognitive test outcomes into two cognitive domain scores representing executive function and processing speed, and memory. Domainspecific z scores were calculated by subtracting the sample mean from participant raw scores and dividing the difference by the standard deviation. Composite z scores for the executive function and processing speed cognitive domain were calculated by averaging the individual z scores of the DSST, TMT parts A and B, Stroop Dot-Color Test, Stroop Color-Word Interference Test, FAS Verbal Fluency Test, and Animal Naming Test. Composite z scores for memory were calculated by averaging the individual z scores of the CVLT-II SDFR and LDFR and the total recall scores and delayed recall scores of the BVMT-R. Associations between patient characteristics and cognitive outcomes were determined using Pearson correlations or analyses of variance (ANOVA).\nTo test the main hypothesis, linear regression models were used to determine associations between the mean FA of identified WM tracts and composite cognitive variables, controlling for age, sex, and education as decided a priori. To account for multiple comparisons, a false discovery rate of 5 was applied. 21 All other comparisons were considered to be exploratory. Associations between patient characteristics and FA in the most significant WM tracts were determined using Pearson correlations or ANOVA and controlled for in post-hoc analyses. Post-hoc analyses were performed in a subgroup of men only because of previously reported WM microstructural differences between the sexes 22 or controlling for histories of MI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery because these diagnoses have been previously associated with cognition in CAD. 12,23 All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 19.0; IBM, Armonk, NY).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study demonstrates that WM microstructural integrity is positively associated with cognitive performance in older adults with CAD. Although individual vascular risk factors have been associated with WM microstructural disruption 24,25 and cognitive decline, 26 in contrast this study focused on CAD patients who typically present with multiple vascular risk factors and who may be most vulnerable to cerebral WM damage. The present findings suggest that subtle changes in otherwise NAWM may partly explain CAD-associated cognitive decline, particularly subtle deficits in executive function and processing speed. These changes are independent of the macrostructural WM damage investigated previously in the form of WMHs, because hyperintense voxels were removed from the present analyses. 4,10,11 For comparison, WMH volumes of these CAD subjects tended to be higher than those of similarly aged healthy subjects from the Rotterdam study (approximately 1.9 mL), 27 consistent with their hypothesized relationship with vascular risk factors. Although FA was strongly associated with age, the associations between FA in NAWM and executive function and processing speed were independent of age as well as education, sex, and cardiac histories. The adjusted models explained large proportions of the variance in executive function with FA values as the most significant predictors. Overall, nominally significant associations between executive function and processing speed and FA and MD consistently implicated the same WM tracts, notably the bilateral parahippocampal cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These effects appear to be somewhat lateralized, as executive function and processing speed composite scores were more significantly associated with WM integrity localized to the left hemisphere. This finding is consistent with previous evidence suggesting leftlateralized WM damage to be responsible for impairments in executive function. 28 Language function is thought to be left-brain lateralized 29 and may partly explain this finding because many components of the executive function and processing speed composite score are somewhat language dependent.\nLeft parahippocampal cingulum FA, in particular, was significantly associated with executive function and processing speed (Fig. 1). Further, MD in the right parahippocampal cingulum was negatively correlated with executive function. These findings corroborate a critical role of the cingulum in executive dysfunction in vascular cognitive impairment. 30 Decreased FA in the cingulum has been associated with poorer executive function in nondemented older adults 31 and has been implicated in patients with mild Alzheimer disease 32 and with increased body mass index. 25 Exploratory analyses of individual cognitive tests revealed that microstructural integrity in the left parahippocampal cingulum was most strongly associated with tests of processing speed in agreement with previous studies of cognitive aging in healthy elderly. 33 Although principal component analyses suggested that various measures related to executive function tended to cluster together with tasks of processing speed, executive function encompasses a broad range of functions, including attention, set-shifting, and response inhibition.\nAs exploratory analysis, associations between WM microstructural integrity and the individual cognitive tasks were examined. Left parahippocampal cingulum FA was significantly associated with all tests of processing speed; moreover, FA was more strongly associated with performance on the TMT part A than TMT part B and on the Stroop Color-Dot Test than the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test (Supplemental Table 1), suggesting that FA in this tract may affect processing speed rather than executive functions such as set-shifting and response inhibition. This finding suggests that impaired cortical connection via the cingulum as measured by reduced FA may be specifically important for processing speed. Although other tracts of interest were not significantly associated with executive function and processing speed domains, exploratory analyses revealed significant relationships with individual cognitive tests. FA in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus was positively correlated with performance in the FAS Verbal Fluency test (Supplemental Table 1). Interestingly, these associations appear to be lateralized to the left hemisphere in agreement with left-hemispheric specialization for language function. 34 These findings demonstrate that subtle damage in otherwise NAWM may be important contributors to minor deficits on cognitive performance. Mean FA and MD measures also implicated the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in executive function and processing speed (Fig. 2) with especially strong correlations with the FAS test of verbal fluency (Supplemental Tables 1 and2). Although not well-studied, a contribution of this tract to executive processes involved in activities of daily living has been shown in healthy young adults. 35 The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus has also be suggested to be important in language functions 36 and to be affected by increased systolic blood pressure. 24 Finally, mean MD in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus was also associated with executive function, corroborating the suggestion that subtle vascular damage to this tract may contribute to subtle vascular cognitive impairment. 37 No associations were found between memory performance and FA values in any of the WM tracts. Further exploratory analyses of individual WM tracts and individual memory tests did not reveal any significant associations except for FA in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (temporal) and BVMT-delayed recall (Supplemental Table 1). This finding corroborates published literature demonstrating that visuospatial memory is mediated predominantly by the right hemisphere. 38 Interestingly, MD values in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the left and right parahippocampal cingulum were also found to be nominally negatively correlated with memory outcomes. These findings corroborate some previous studies that have shown MD to be associated with memory, whereas FA was not. 39 Although some degree of collinearity exists between FA and MD, FA and MD likely provide complementary measures of WM microstructural integrity that together explain more of the variance seen in cognitive performance, and possibly the associated mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Specifically, FA is thought to represent axonal injury, whereas MD is thought to represent tract density and myelin sheath integrity, 15 both of which may be affected in subjects with CAD. Such pathologies are observed in WMHs 40 and may also occur to some extent in NAWM.\nThis study is limited by the lack of a control group; as such, the independent influence of cardiac events and vascular risk factors cannot be ascertained. However, comparing those with and without cognitive impairment in a CAD population allowed assessment of factors that may contribute to vascular cognitive impairment in this cognitively-at-risk population. The presence of CAD itself is thought to affect cognitive aging compared with healthy control subjects as has previously been shown. 1 The relatively high level of education of these study participants may have contributed to a cognitive reserve that possibly masked subtle cognitive deficits, necessitating control for education. The small number of women (N ¼ 7) included limits the ability of the study to examine the effects of sex; however, the main findings did not change in a subgroup of men only. The study sample consisted of participants who were referred to and agreed to enter cardiac rehabilitation, which may have introduced a selection bias limiting generalizability; however, cardiac rehabilitation is a standard of care and provided publicly in Canada, potentially reducing referral bias somewhat. Because the objective was to examine FA in NAWM, WMH volumes were dilated by one voxel into NAWM and removed; however, there is limited knowledge on what distance from the WMHs might be affected in otherwise NAWM. Although correction for multiple comparisons was applied to FA in the 20 major tracts, all other comparisons were unadjusted and considered exploratory. Finally, the use of the composite scores for cognitive domains serves as a limitation because analysis of more specific executive functions, such as set-shifting and response inhibition, could not be done. Future prospective studies should examine whether baseline DTI measures can prospectively predict cognitive decline and whether cognitive changes are associated with changes in DTI indices. This study identifies microstructural neurobiologic markers associated with subtle differences in cognitive performance in a population vulnerable to vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. 2",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a worldwide progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. Previous research has indicated that Alzheimers disease impairs white matter (WM) tracts. Anatomical and neuroimaging studies have indicated that WM tracts are associated with cognitive function. Whether the abnormal WM integrity in AD is associated with cognitive impairments and the clinical symptoms is still not clear. To this end, we investigated the relationship between the impairments in WM tracts and the decline of cognitive ability in AD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected from 38 AD patients and 30 normal, cognitively healthy volunteers. The tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach was used to compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values between the two groups. WM tracts (cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF)) associated with cognition function were extracted for region of interest (ROI)-based analysis. Significantly decreased FA values and increased MD values of the cognition-related WM tracts were observed in the AD group compared with the normal cognition (NC) group. In addition, we further demonstrated that the decreased FA values and increased MD values of the cognition-related WM tracts were significantly correlated with MMSE scores. These results indicated that abnormal changes in WM integrity are observed following AD. Finally, we used support vector machine (SVM) with a repeated, stratified 10-fold cross-validated classifier to evaluate the ability of FA and MD values to discriminate disease. The accuracy of the SVM using cognition-related WM as classified features was higher than that using non-cognition-related tracts. Most importantly, our results showed the relationship between abnormal WM tracts and cognitive ability in AD. These findings further suggested that AD-related impairments in cognition-related WM tracts may influence the cognitive ability of AD patients. Introduction Alzheimers disease (AD) is the main type of dementia that afflicts millions of elderly individuals. A recent study estimated that there would be over 1.25 billion individuals affected by dementia worldwide by 2050 (Stephen et al., 2017) . Previous studies have shown the",

      "text": "morphology and function of the pathways between different brain regions that are gradually damaged in AD patients; for review see (Pini et al., 2016). In post-mortem studies, white matter (WM) lesions have been shown to be associated with AD (Brun and Englund, 1986;Bronge et al., 2002). Studies have found that the possible pathologic mechanisms of WM lesions in AD include Wallerian degeneration; demyelination; axonal damage and gliosis; DNA breakage and a lack of plasmalogen (Parente et al., 2008;Alves et al., 2015).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive imaging technology based on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging that can quantitatively analyse the anisotropy of water molecule diffusion in different directions and is sensitive to in vivo WM microstructure. Therefore, DTI can indicate fibre orientation, membrane permeability, demyelination and axonal damage caused by disease, which cannot be obtained from conventional MRI. In recent years, DTI has become a powerful technique to study neurodegenerative disease (Acostacabronero and Nestor, 2014;Liu et al., 2014). Voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) have been two of the main methods used for DTI analysis. VBA has been used to study the changes in anisotropy without specifying ROIs or tracts in a fully automated manner (Ashburner and Friston, 2000). However, VBA is highly sensitive to registration errors; thus, alignment-related problems may yield serious problems (Ashburner and Friston, 2000;Bookstein, 2001;Schwarz et al., 2014). Jones et al demonstrated that the current voxel-based methods can obtain dramatically different results using the same DTI data (Jones et al., 2007). TBSS has been proposed as a new voxel-based method in recent years. It can alleviate the alignment-related problems and improve sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability by projecting all fractional anisotropy (FA) voxels onto the nearest location on an FA-skeleton of the major WM structures (Smith et al., 2006(Smith et al., , 2007)). TBSS has been used to analyse DTI data in various diseases, such as epilepsy (Scanlon et al., 2013), stroke (Dacostaaguayo et al., 2014), Parkinson (Perea et al., 2013), schizophrenia (Roalf et al., 2013), traumatic brain injury (Zhu et al., 2014) and so on. Additionally, some cognitive studies have used TBSS to study disorders including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. These results indicated that the WM tract abnormalities (reduced FA and increased MD) were widespread in AD patients. The altered WM tracts included corpus callosum, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus (UF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), fornix, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and so on. (Stricker et al., 2009;Pievani et al., 2010;ODwyer et al., 2011;Bosch et al., 2012;Huang et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2013;Acostacabronero and Nestor, 2014). In addition, similar widespread WM tract changes were observed in MCI patients according to a meta-analysis on DTI studies (Sexton et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, previous studies have suggested that the cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus are closely associated with cognitive function (Sasson et al., 2013), including the working memory (Sepulcre et al., 2009), attention (Nestor et al., 2007;Hamilton et al., 2008), language (Catani et al., 2003;Wise, 2003), visual memories (Shinoura et al., 2007;Thomas et al., 2009) and so on. The manner in which cognitionrelated WM tracts, are impaired in AD is not clear. In addition, the relationship between the impairments in WM tracts and the decline of cognitive ability in AD is not clear. To this end, we hypothesized that cognition-related WM tract dysfunction would be associated with AD and clinical indices, and it could be an useful biomarker for AD. First, we used the TBSS approach to conduct whole-brain DTI data analyses. Second, we focused on the AD-related changes in four important cognition-related axon bundles associated with memory ability compared with a normal cognition (NC) group and explored the relationship among the FA and mean diffusivity (MD) of cognition-related WM tracts and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) with the FA and MD values of different WM tracts to test the probability of classification between AD and NC according to WM tracts.",

Then, the transformed FA images were averaged to generate a mean FA image, which was subsequently skeletonized, thus, representing tracts common to all of the subjects. To prevent the inclusion of non-skeleton voxels, each subjects aligned FA map was mapped onto the mean FA skeleton using a lower threshold of FA of 0.2, in order to exclude grey matter voxels. The approach of carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by the creation of a mean FA skeleton intends to face the cross-subject spatial variability effect. The nonlinear warps and skeleton projection stages were then repeated using the MD data. In this study, we used two-sample nonparametric t-tests to assess the group differences between the AD and NC groups. Voxel-wise nonparametric testing was performed using randomize in FSL (with 5000 permutations).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we found that patients with AD had widespread WM integrity disruptions. Most importantly, we further focused on the alterations in cognition-related tracts, including the cingulum, ILF, SLF and UF, between the AD and NC groups. ROI-based statistical analysis of the cognition-related tracts showed that the FA values were significantly decreased, and the MD values were increased in the AD group compared with the NC group. Our results further showed the significant correlation between abnormal WM tracts and the MMSE scores. Finally, the accuracy of SVM using the FA and MD values of cognition-related WM tracts as classifier features was higher than that using non-cognition-related WM tracts. These findings further suggest that the AD-related impairments in cognition-related WM tracts may influence the cognitive abilities of AD patients.\nDTI can be used for the quantitative assessment of microstructural WM damage in brain disorders. FA and MD are prominent DTI-derived quantitative measures of WM microstructure that describe the degree of diffusion anisotropy and the average amount of diffusion within a voxel, respectively (Le Bihan et al., 2001;Assaf and Pasternak, 2008). Recently, the TBSS approach has become a very useful voxel-based technique for characterizing WM integrity across the whole brain. The TBSS approach has been widely used to provide important information regarding WM disruption in the context of different brain disorders (Liu et al., 2011). In this study, we used the voxel-wise TBSS approach, and the results showed decreased FA values and increased MD values throughout almost the whole WM skeleton of AD patients. Previous studies have shown significantly FA reduction and MD increase in AD patients involving uncinate, superior, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, cingulum, corpus callosum and thalamic peduncle. (Stricker et al., 2009;Pievani et al., 2010;ODwyer et al., 2011;Bosch et al., 2012;Huang et al., 2012;Pini et al., 2016). Our results were consistent with those of previous AD studies that showed that WM tracts are significantly impaired in AD widespread. The WM disruption in AD may be involved in complex mechanisms that may be related to the toxicity of Aβ peptides, tau deposition in CSF, demyelination, axonal loss, death of oligodendroglia cells and glial alterations (Liu et al., 2013). Previous researches indicated that the amyloid deposition around neuronal cells or neurofibrillary tangles ultimately leaded to degeneration of axons and myelin. (Alves et al., 2015) However, it remained unclear whether these WM tract abnormalities would be associated with cognitive function in AD. Therefore, we specifically focused on the cognition-related WM tracts. A previous study of normal aging indicated that the WMs of the UF, cingulum, ILF, and SLF were within the cognition-related domain (Sasson et al., 2013). The superior longitudinal fasciculus has been shown to play an important role in advanced cognitive functions, more specifically language and language disorders (Catani et al., 2003;Geldmacher et al., 2007); the inferior longitudinal fasciculus is mainly evolved in visual memory, such as face recognition (Shinoura et al., 2007;Thomas et al., 2009); the uncinate fasciculus participate in memory processing and extraction (Levine et al., 1998;Squire et al., 2004); and the cingulum is important for many brain functions. Our results showed that the FA values extracted from the cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus in AD group were almost significantly decreased compared with the NC group, with the exception of a small part of the uncinate fasciculus (ROI 19,20). In addition, the MD values of the cognition-related WM tracts were significantly increased in the AD group. Our findings were in line with those of previous research showing that the cognition-related WM tracts are impaired in AD patients (Stricker et al., 2009;Pievani et al., 2010;ODwyer et al., 2011;Bosch et al., 2012;Huang et al., 2012). In particular, the cingulum exhibited the most severe impairments of the cognition-related tract. The cingulum was considered to span from the cingulate gyrus to the entorhinal cortex in the brain and to be involved in many brain functions, such as working memory (Sepulcre et al., 2009), and attention (Nestor et al., 2007;Hamilton et al., 2008). A previous study, based on a fibre-based approach, indicated that there was a significant reduction in the fractional anisotropy of the cingulum in AD patients. One VBM investigation showed that the degree of hippocampal grey matter atrophy in AD patients was specifically correlated to decreased WM volume in the cingulum bundle, and another study indicated that the WM disruption in the cingulum was significantly correlated with the degree of glucose hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex, as well as with that of hypometabolism in other subcortical and cortical regions (Radanovic et al., 2013). Some previous studies recently indicated that the changes in FA were asymmetric between the left and right hemispheres of the brain in AD and MCI patients, and the WM on the left side of brain was much more seriously affected than that of the right side of brain. However, in our studies, the results showed that the WM tracts of the two hemispheres were all significantly impaired, and the degree of the impairment in both hemispheres was the same. These results indicated that AD might impair WM in both hemispheres (Liu et al., 2011).\nTo further investigate the relationship between the cognition-related WM impairment and decreased cognitive ability in AD, we calculated the correlation between the FA and MD values of the cognitionrelated tracts and the MMSE scores. The results indicated the specific cognition-related WM tracts that were significantly correlated with the MMSE scores, including the cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. The betweengroup correlation analysis can partly indicated the WM tracts abnormalities were related with the AD progress. The findings of previous studies indicated that DTI was sensitive enough to track cognitive decline, showing great correlations with global cognitive function, as assessed by the MMSE (Hiyoshi-Taniguchi et al., 2015;Nir et al., 2015), CDR (Nir et al., 2015), and memory tests (Bosch et al., 2012). Our results indicated that the cognition-related WM disruption may cause cognitive impairment, which was in line with the findings of a few previous studies (Radanovic et al., 2013). Additionally, we further investigated the correlation between the MMSE scores and FA values of the within-groups, the result shown no significant correlation between the MMSE scores and the FA values. The lack of correlation may be due to the smaller sample size reduced the statistic power (Li et al., 2014). It was interesting that previous research has shown that the cognitionrelated WM tract disruptions were closely related to decreased functional connectivity in AD patients (Uddin et al., 2011). Particularly, the functional neuroimaging literature has indicated that AD degenerates intrinsic connectivity networks, specifically the default mode network (DMN) (Delbeuck et al., 2003;Zhou et al., 2012;Brier et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2016). The cingulum and UF are important WM tracts that form reciprocal connections between DMN regions. These regions reflecting impairments in cognition-related WM tracts may influence the message transmission between different brain regions, thus, causing the impairment of cognitive function in AD patients (Greicius et al., 2009;Jones et al., 2013).\nIn addition, the correlation between the impairment of cognitionrelated WM and the MMSE scores might be an important biomarker for the detection of AD. An SVM is very useful classification method that is based on the statistical learning theory. Thus, we trained the SVM with the FA and MD values from the ROIs of the different WM tracts. Our results indicated that the accuracy of the SVM classification used the FA and MD values of the ROIs of the cognition-related WM tracts could reach 83.33, and that used the whole ROIs could reach 91.76. These results indicated that the WM tract impairments might provide a useful index for classifying AD and NC subjects. It was very interesting that the accuracy of the SVM classification used the FA and MD values of the ROIs of the non-cognition-related WM tracts only reached 75. These results indicated that the cognition-related WM tracts were more sensitive than others in AD. We further tested the importance of each feature, the results was indicated the cingulum was the most sensitive WM tract between the AD and NC groups. In addition, we found the most MD values of the WM tracts were more sensitive than the FA values. The findings of previous research showed that the UF can be a predictor of conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to AD (Hiyoshi-Taniguchi et al., 2015). Mielke et al. (2012) found that the FA and MD values of the fornix were very good predictors of progression from MCI to AD, with an accuracy of 95.7 (Mielke et al., 2012). In addition, Gold et al (2012), who tested the added value of DTI over MRI markers in MCI classification, reported that adding the FA values of the cingulum to hippocampal volume measurements increased the accuracy from 77 to 91 (Gold et al., 2012). Our results further suggested that the impairment in cognition-related WM tracts might be an important biomarker for AD diagnosis.\nThe main limitation of this study was the relatively small number of AD and NC subjects, which limited the statistical power. No significantly correlation between the MMSE score and FA values within groups might be due to the small sample. We will collect much more subjects in the future. In addition to the small groups, we did not investigate the atrophy of the cognition-related WM tracts in MCI patients. Investigating the differences in cognition-related WM tracts between MCI-AD and MCI-NC groups might also be important. Additionally, in this research, we only focused on MMSE scores as a measure of clinical severity. In further studies, we will collect much different clinical indices from the patients or will even design some targeted experiments to reflect cognitive ability. Finally, the subjects were only from the Beijing 301 hospital. In the future, we will collect the data from the different hospitals, and use the cross-section data to increase the statistical power.\nIn conclusion, the present study examined whether AD-related impairments in WM tracts may affect cognitive ability. Our results showed that the WM tracts were significantly damaged by AD, and the cognition-related WM microstructure was disrupted in AD subjects compared with NC subjects. Moreover, the patients decreased FA values and increased MD values were significantly related to the MMSE scores. Our findings indicated that the cognitive impairment in AD patients likely depends on WM, and the cognition related WM tracts could be the potential biomarker for AD.",

      "text": "Results: Widespread β-amyloid depositions were found in cortical regions, and striatum (Thal stage III) along with tau pathology restricted to the mesial-temporal structures (Braak stage IIIIV).\nVolumetricshape analysis of subcortical structures revealed atrophy of the hippocampal-amygdala complex. In addition, cortical thinning was detected in the right middle temporal pole. Alterations of multiple DTI indices were noted in the major white matter fiber bundles, together with disruption of default mode and sensory-motor network functional connectivity. Molecular genetic analysis by next-generation sequencing revealed a heterozygote missense pathogenic variant of the PSEN1 (Met233Val). Conclusion: Multimodal PETMR imaging is able to deliver, in a one-stop-shop approach, an array of molecular, structural and functional brain information in AD due to de novo pathogenic variant, which can be studied for spatial interplay and might provide a rationale for initiating antiamyloidtau therapeutic approaches.

    "abstract": "Cortical cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) are associated with loss of white matter (WM) integrity and cognitive impairment in cross-sectional studies, while further investigation using longitudinal datasets is required. This study aims to establish the association between cortical CMIs and WM integrity assessed by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measures and to investigate whether DTI measures mediate the relationship between cortical CMIs and cognitive decline. Cortical CMIs were graded on 3T MRI. DTI measures were derived from histogram analysis of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). Cognitive function was assessed using a neuropsychological test battery. Linear mixed-effect models were employed to examine associations of cortical CMIs with longitudinal changes in DTI measures and cognitive function. Final analysis included 231 patients (71.14 AE 7.60 years). Presence of cortical CMIs at baseline was associated with longitudinal changes in MD median and peak height and FA median and peak height, as well as global cognition (b ¼ À0.50, 95CI: À0.91, À0.09) and executive function (b ¼ À0.77, 95CI: À1.25, À0.28). MD median mediated the cross-sectional association between cortical CMIs and global cognition. Further studies are required to investigate whether cortical CMIs and loss of WM integrity are causally related or if they are parallel mechanisms that contribute to cognitive decline.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cortical cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) are small ischemic lesions restricted to cerebral cortex, which are known to be associated with cognitive impairment, especially in the domains of visuoconstruction and language. 123 Cortical CMIs are caused by occlusion of penetrating arterioles to the cortex, which may result from pathological changes in small cerebral vessels, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and arteriolosclerosis. 4 Additional mechanisms, such as cerebral hypoperfusion and microembolism, may also play a role in the formation of these lesions, as the penetrating end-arterioles are susceptible to ischemia induced by hypoperfusion. 4 It is suggested that cortical CMIs lead to cognitive impairment by disrupting white matter (WM) structural connectivity. 5 A previous study has shown that CMI-induced injury could be far beyond the lesion locale and affect a perilesional zone at least 12-fold greater than the microinfarct core. 6 With advanced neuroimaging techniques, it is now possible to quantify alterations in the WM using diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the diffusion of water molecules in the brain and thus can be used to assess microstructural alterations in the WM. Furthermore, advanced MRI diffusion data and tractography can be employed to build WM tracts and to assess WM networks in the brain. 7 It has been found that DTI parameters obtained from different analysis methods showed consistent cross-sectional associations with impaired cognitive function and predicted dementia conversion. 8 Our previous research also demonstrated that DTI measures at baseline predicted cognitive decline at year 2 of follow-up. 9 Of the various DTI parameters, median and peak height of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) are derived from histogram analysis of the MD and FA maps. 10 A recent study showed that MD median from the whole WM tracts was the most sensitive among all the DTI parameters examined, in relation to cognitive impairment and dementia conversion. 11 Although the association of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) with cognitive impairment and dementia has been well established, 12 it is important to note that regions with WMHs represent only a fraction of the entire WM regions affected. 13 Subclinical pathological changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) may precede the formation of visible WMHs, and studying DTI parameters from NAWM could be crucial in identifying early biomarkers of changes in WM microstructure and cognition. 13 Rapid and semi-automated DTI measures have increasingly been used as biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia in multiple studies. 8,11 Previous studies have indeed demonstrated that loss of WM integrity mediates the association between cortical CMIs and impairment in visuoconstruction, utilizing advanced diffusion measures such as network-based mean efficiency and degree centrality. 5 However, most of these studies were limited to crosssectional data, making it challenging to establish temporal and causal relationships. Without longitudinal settings, it becomes difficult to understand the progression and directionality of these relationships over time. Additionally, another limitation in these studies was the lack of distinction between the NAWM and WM lesions when deriving DTI measures. Focusing on the whole WM regions may mask subtle changes occurring in the NAWM, which could serve as potential early biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction.\nThis study aims to establish both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cortical CMIs, MD and FA measures from NAWM, and cognitive function. We further aim to investigate whether MD and FA measures from NAWM mediate the relationship between cortical CMIs and cognitive function. We hypothesize that the presence of cortical CMIs is associated with loss of WM integrity reflected by DTI measure changes, which mediate the association between cortical CMIs and cognitive decline.",

      "text": "A total of 554 patients were recruited from a memory clinic cohort in Singapore between 12 August 2010 and 27 December 2016. Patients diagnosed with no cognitive impairment (NCI) or cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) were included in this study (n ¼ 343). NCI was diagnosed if patients had neither impaired domains on neuropsychological assessments nor functional loss in daily life, while CIND was diagnosed if patients had at least one impaired domain on neuropsychological assessments but no functional loss. After further excluding 112 patients (78 without DTI images, 8 due to poor image quality, 5 with missing data for cognitive function, 19 without cortical CMI data, and 2 without data for other MRI markers), a final sample of 231 patients was included for analysis. Data on demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cortical CMIs were collected at baseline, while DTI measures, other MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and cognitive function were assessed at baseline and year 2 of follow-up.\nEthics approval was obtained from National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Review Board.

      "text": "MD and FA measures from NAWM were computed based on a previous procedure, 9,19 using software from FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (http:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk fslfslwikiFDT). Briefly, MD and FA maps were created by fitting a diffusion-tensor model to the diffusion data at the voxel level (DTIFIT) (Supplemental Figure 2). We then performed FLAIR-T1 and T1-b0 registrations and concatenated the affine transformation matrices to generate a FLAIR-DTI transformation, which was used to register Tissue Probability Maps into DTI space. Hard segmentations were applied to generate maps of tissue classes with each voxel being assigned to the highest-probability tissue class (i.e., gray matter, WM, or cerebrospinal fluid). To identify NAWM, T1-b0 and FLAIR-b0 registrations were performed using a 12-parameter affine registration with a normalized mutual information cost function. NAWM in DTI was classified as non-lesion voxels where the probability of WM was greater than gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid. 9 Histogram analysis in NAWM regions was conducted to derive the summary histogram measures, which were taken from normalized histograms with 1000 bins (bin width ¼ 0.004 mm 2 s À1 Â 10 À3 ; range: 0-4 mm 2 s À1 Â 10 À3 ). 9 Each DTI measure was standardized to its respective mean and standard deviation (SD). Global cognition and domain-specific z-scores were generated based on previously reported procedures. 2,9,20 Raw scores from each individual test were standardized to the means and SDs derived from the reference group (i.e., NCI and first visit). These z-scores were then averaged within cognitive domains and standardized using the composite means and SDs of the reference group to generate respective z-scores of six domains. Global cognitive z-scores were calculated by averaging the z-scores of six domains and then standardized to the means and SDs of the reference group.",

To compare differences between groups, Pearsons Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, and two-sample t test were employed for categorical, non-normally distributed, and normally distributed variables, respectively.\nLinear regression models were used to test the crosssectional association between cortical CMIs and DTI measures at baseline. Both the presence of cortical CMIs and cortical CMI counts were examined. When examining longitudinal DTI measures at two timepoints (i.e., baseline and year 2 of follow-up), linear mixed-effect models (nlme package in R) were utilized. A random intercept or both a random intercept and slope were included in the model, depending on the results of the likelihood ratio test to compare nested models. An interaction term of cortical CMIs with time was included when investigating the effect of cortical CMIs on changes of DTI measures over time. Similarly, an interaction term of cortical CMIs with sex or clinical diagnosis (i.e., NCICIND) was included in the model when examining potential effect modifiers. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons across four DTI measures, and the threshold for statistical significance was set as p-value of 0.054 ¼ 0.0125.\nSame analyses were conducted to study the relationship between cortical CMIs and cognitive function. For six cognitive domains, the threshold for statistical significance was set as p-value of 0.056  0.008 after Bonferroni correction.\nWe utilized multivariable regression models to adjust for potential confounders, which were identified as known risk factors for cortical CMIs based on the previous literature. 123 Model 1 accounted for demographics, including age, sex, ethnicity, and years of education. Model 2 further adjusted for MRI markers of CeVD, total hippocampal volume, and cardiovascular risk factors, which included the history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as smoking status (non-smoker, former current smoker).\nMediation analysis (mediation package 4.5.0 in R) was conducted to investigate the mediation effect of baseline DTI measures on the relationship between the presence of cortical CMIs and baseline cognitive function. Latent Growth Models (lavaan package 0.6-15 in R) were used to explore the longitudinal mediation effect. Two latent factors were created to represent longitudinal changes in DTI measures and cognitive function between the two time-points, respectively, as previously documented. 21,22 The latent factor representing changes in DTI measures was treated as the mediator while the latent factor representing changes in cognitive function was treated as the outcome. Demographics, MRI markers of CeVD, total hippocampal volume, and cardiovascular risk factors were also adjusted for in cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation analyses.\nStatistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.2.1), and a p-value of 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study found that the presence of cortical CMIs was associated with both baseline and longitudinal DTI measures derived from NAWM, including MD median, MD peak height, FA median, and FA peak height. The presence of cortical CMIs was related to impairment in global cognition and executive function. Moreover, baseline DTI measures mediated the association between cortical CMIs and baseline cognitive performance, specifically in global cognition and cognitive domains including executive function, memory, and visuomotor speed. These findings align with a previous study in memory clinic patients, which showed that cortical CMIs were associated with greater decline in global cognition, memory, and language domains. 2 Our study has demonstrated a significant association between cortical CMIs and longitudinal changes in global cognition and executive function, even after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, MRI markers of CeVD, and total hippocampal volume. The difference in impaired domains between two studies may be attributed to differences in study populations, as the current study excluded demented patients. Furthermore, adjusting for total hippocampal volume, an early marker of Alzheimers disease, did not change the association between cortical CMIs and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that the observed association may be due to underlying vascular pathologies rather than neurodegeneration. This assumption finds support in previous research, which has shown that cortical CMIs were most strongly associated with vascular dementia. 3 While some previous studies have shown an association between imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) (e.g., lacunes and WMHs) and WM integrity assessed by DTI measures, 19,23 the results regarding cortical CMIs have been limited and controversial. In addition, DTI measures were derived from the whole WM region, which may otherwise mask subtle changes in the NAWM. One study in memory clinic patients showed no association between cortical CMIs and FA-or MD-weighted WM connectivity. 24 However, another study conducted in patients with cognitive impairment found a significant association between cortical CMIs and impaired WM network. 5 Our study echoed this finding and found that the presence of cortical CMIs was significantly associated with MD and FA measures from the NAWM, both crosssectionally and longitudinally, which indicates that WM alterations related to cortical CMIs may occur long before the formation of apparent WM lesions. Moreover, our study observed a borderline interaction between cortical CMIs and MD median by time, suggesting that cortical CMIs may be associated with progressive impairment in the WM network.\nIt is suggested that cortical CMIs can lead to cognitive dysfunction via both direct neuron injury within the microinfarct core and their influence on remote brain tissue. 4 The remote effects of cortical CMIs include their association with cortical atrophy and WM dysconnectivity. 4,25 It is considered that cortical CMIs may affect WM connectivity at a global level rather than only in the perilesional regions, as detecting a single cortical CMI indicates hundreds to thousands of such lesions throughout the brain. 4 The WM network plays a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function and facilitating communication between different brain regions. 26 A previous study has shown that loss of WM integrity in different fibers can have different impacts on the association between CSVD and cognitive impairment depending on the specific types of CSVD (i.e., lacunes, WMHs, and CMBs) and cognitive domains being examined. 19 However, these studies did not specifically investigate cortical CMIs and were limited to cross-sectional settings.\nAs a more recent MRI marker of CSVD, cortical CMIs share etiological factors, such as CAA and arteriolosclerosis, with other forms of CSVD. 27 Both CAA and arteriolosclerosis can cause lumen narrowing and impair self-regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in arterioles, resulting in decreased CBF to the cortex and the formation of cortical CMI lesions. 28 Moreover, existing evidence has shown that cortical CMIs can disrupt WM connectivity through mechanisms involving inflammation, oxidative damage, and blood-brain barrier leakage. 29,30 These pathological changes may lead to proximal axonal injury and secondary degeneration in distal fiber pathways, 19 affecting the NAWM even distant from the microinfarct core. In our study, we observed that DTI measures from the NAWM mediated the association between cortical CMIs and global cognition as well as cognitive domains such as executive function, memory, and visuomotor speed in a cross-sectional setting, which is consistent with previous findings. 5 Among the four DTI measures, MD median showed the largest mediation effect, echoing the findings of a previous study, which also found that MD median had the largest effect size in relation to cognition among all six DTI measures. 11 Although both MD and FA reflect WM microstructural integrity, they may capture slightly different pathophysiological processes, which require further clarification. 9 FA is considered to measure irreversible structural changes like axonal degeneration, while MD may additionally capture increase in interstitial or extracellular fluid, 31 potentially related to inflammation and blood-brain barrier leakage. This distinction could partly explain the greater mediation effect observed with MD measures. Direct effect means the effect of cortical CMIs on cognitive function independent of DTI measures. d Proportion of mediation effect is equal to indirect effect divided by total effect which is the sum of indirect and direct effect.\nHowever, we did not observe any mediation effect of DTI measures on longitudinal changes in any cognitive domain. Although the presence of cortical CMIs was associated with a greater decline in global cognition and visuomotor speed, less than 5 of these associations could be explained by changes in DTI measures. This may be due to the relatively short follow-up time in the current study, which might not have been sufficient to observe a noticeable change in WM integrity and subsequent cognitive decline. Additionally, the inclusion of only patients with no or mild cognitive impairment in our study, who typically exhibit slow progression of cerebrovascular pathology and cognitive dysfunction, may have contributed to the lack of significantly longitudinal mediation effects. Based on the above considerations, this study cannot yet conclude that the presence of cortical CMIs and loss of WM integrity are causally related. These two conditions are also likely to occur in parallel, both contributing to cognitive dysfunction.\nIt is important to acknowledge some limitations of our study. Firstly, we graded cortical CMIs on 3T MRI, which may have underestimated the true burden of CMI lesions compared to higher-resolution 7T MRI. However, the use of 3T MRI increases generalizability of our findings to clinical practice due to its wider availability. Secondly, histogram analysis of MD and FA maps could lead to the loss of topographic information and thus we could not examine the tractspecific effect of WM damage on different cognitive domains. Thirdly, this study focused on memory clinic patients, who may have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease compared to community-based cohorts. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to the general population, without separate studies. Finally, residual confounding is inevitable for observational studies, although a wide range of potential confounders have been adjusted for in this study.\nThis study has several strengths. Firstly, we examined the relationship between cortical CMIs, DTI measures, and cognitive function using a longitudinal dataset, which was an extension of previous research. Secondly, this study utilized a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive function, which provided a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of cortical CMIs on different aspects of cognition. Thirdly, NAWM was investigated rather than the whole WM, facilitating our understanding about the subclinical change in WM and its association with cognitive dysfunction caused by cortical CMIs.\nIn conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence of the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cortical CMIs, DTI measures from the NAWM, and cognitive function. Although we did not establish the mediation effect of WM dysconnectivity on the association between cortical CMIs and cognitive dysfunction in a longitudinal setting, this research is an important addition to current studies on the etiology of cognitive impairment and dementia, especially those related to CSVD. Further longitudinal studies with a longer follow-up time are required to establish the time sequence and causal relationship between cortical CMIs, loss of WM integrity, and cognitive decline.",

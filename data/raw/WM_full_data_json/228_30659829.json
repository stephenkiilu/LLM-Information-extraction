      "text": "large or small vessel disease or a combination of the two (Gorelick et al., 2011;Thal et al., 2012). In the case of large vessel disease, progression of the dementia may be rapid due to single or repeated strokes whereas progression is slower with small vessel disease. With large vessel disease, damage may occur to both grey and white matter but in small vessel disease lesions tend to be limited to white matter (Kalaria, 2016). Common risk factors for VaD are diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome (Craft, 2009). While the term VaD focuses on the cognitive impairment that is the hallmark of the disorder, affective and behavioral manifestations are commonly encountered in conjunction with dementia and complicate the clinical picture and treatment. There is currently no specific treatment for VaD and medications used are those employed in Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia, including cholinesterase inhibitors and drugs used to control behavioral manifestations such as atypical antipsychotic drugs (OBrien and Thomas, 2015).\nDevelopment of specific treatments for VaD is a high priority and requires appropriate animal models in which memory impairment and characteristic white matter lesions are observed, thus satisfying requirements for face and construct validity. Assessment of non-cognitive behaviors such as depression and anxiety-like features is indicated in view of the high prevalence of non-cognitive symptoms in VaD. In the absence of specific treatments for VaD, it is not possible to demonstrate predictive validity. Rodent models of VaD are based on interventions that reduce cerebral blood flow either acutely or chronically. Models that are chronic in nature and more close reflect small vessel disease include bilateral carotid artery occlusion in normotensive rats, small vessel disease secondary to hypertension in spontaneously hypertensivestroke prone rats, mouse models of global ischemia and mouse models of bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). All these models induce white matter damage and cognitive impairment (Yang et al., 2016).\nThe BCAS model employs the technique of wrapping metal coils (ideally 0.18 mm in diameter) around both surgically exposed common carotid arteries, thereby inducing bilateral cerebral hypoperfusion. As first shown by Shibata et al. (2004), the BCAS model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces cerebral white matter damage without significant gray matter lesions. Reproducible effects of BCAS include blood-brain barrier disruption, glial activation, oxidative stress and oligodendrocyte loss (Shibata et al., 2004). Using a laser Doppler technique, we have demonstrated 70 blood flow reduction in the common carotid arteries after BCAS (Wolf et al., 2017). Moreover, CFB reduction after BCAS microsurgery was also shown by others demonstrating that this 0.18 mm coil in the ideal method for this model (Shibata et al., 2004(Shibata et al., , 2007)). It has been consistently shown that working memory deficits, attributable to damage to frontal-subcortical circuits, are evident 30 days after BCAS on various spatial and reference memory paradigms (Coltman et al., 2011;Shibata et al., 2007).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is a powerful technique to study white matter microstructural integrity following BCAS. DTI is sensitized to the motion of water molecules as they interact within tissues and is used as a probe to infer brain anatomy. There are two ways to perform DTI measurement, in vivo DTI and ex vivo DTI. In vivo DTI allows continuous monitoring of the same animals and reflects the axonal condition in live animals. However, it has limited resolution and is sensitive to motion. Ex vivo DTI is not sensitive to motion and has higher resolution. But, It is known that tissue fixation can alter the ratio of intracellular and extracellular spaces and membrane permeability (Zhang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, ex vivo DTI have been used for studying axon and myelin pathology in animal models (Whittaker et al., 2018). DTI can be particularly useful in the diagnosis of VaD and in differentiation of VaD and Alzheimers disease (Palesi et al., 2018). Although multiple hemorrhages, infarcts and white matter disruptions have been observed in mice following BCAS (Holland et al., 2015), use of DTI in this context has not been reported.\nPrevious work with the BCAS model was done by our group on young adult and old female mice (Wolf et al., 2017). Our aim was to specifically characterize the effects of cerebral hypoperfusion induced by BCAS in aged mice and to identify cognitive and affective consequences of BCAS that are differentially manifested in aged mice. We found a significant effect in the radial-arm water maze, indicating more severe impairment of hippocampal dependent learning and working memory by BCAS in the older mice. Evaluation of the number oligodendrocyte precursor cells demonstrated augmented myelin replacement in old BCAS mice compared with young adult BCAS and old control mice. Microglia of old BCAS mice exhibited striking activation in the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. The use of old mice in our work provided a powerful tool for better understanding the interaction of aging and brain hypoperfusion (Wolf et al., 2017).\nIn the current study we have focused on the relationship of memory impairment induced by BCAS to white matter lesions as demonstrated by ex vivo MRI and to microglia activation. In contrast to our previous report (Wolf et al., 2017), we employed male mice in the current study and again assessed effects of cerebral hypoperfusion on myelin and microglia in addition to behavioral and cognitive tests and brain imaging.",

In the novel object recognition test, while control mice displayed the expected preference for the novel object (mean  0.59, 95 CI 0.55 to 0.63), in BCAS-operated mice no such preference was observed (mean  0.49, 95 CI 0.44 to 0.53), yielding a significant difference between experimental groups (t (29)  3.21, p  0.003, Fig. 1a).

    "Brain imaging": {
      "text": "To determine the effect of BCAS on white and grey matter, ex-vivo MRI was performed. The MRI protocols included DTI to generate fractional anisotropy (FA) which is a measure of microstructural integrity and anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), an average of radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity that reflects membrane density and is sensitive to cellularity, edema, and necrosis (Alexander et al., 2007). After correction for multiple testing using the false-discovery-rate procedure, the FA analysis revealed significant effects of treatment in the corpus callosum (CC, t (8)  4.37, p  0.002, p FDR  0.011 Fig. 2b) and the anterior commissure (F (1, 8)  57.35, p  0.0001, p FDR  0.001 Fig. 2e), indicating impaired white matter integrity in the BCAS group (nominally significant effects in other brain regions are depicted in Supplementary Table S1). No differences in FA were identified in grey matter areas. MD analysis revealed a main effect of treatment in the internal capsule (F (1, 8)  23.39, p  0.001, p FDR  0.01, Fig. 2c) with a significant increase of MD in the BCAS group. Consistent with FA data, BCAS did not affect MD in grey matter.\nWhen examining the relationship between white matter integrity and cognition at the individual mouse level, we focused on the CC area, as FA in this region has been shown to mediate age-dependent cognitive decline in humans (Madden et al., 2009), and sensitivity of this region to the BCAS procedure was previously reported (Wolf et al., 2017). Both Pearsons (Fig. 3a, r  -0.868, p  0.002) and Spearmans (Fig. 3b, r  -0.845, p  0.004) correlations between CC FA and cognition, assessed by the number of errors made on day I of the radial arm water maze (RAWM) test, were significant, indicating the relevance of white matter integrity as an endophenotype in this model system. This correlation remained significant after controlling for treatment (r part  -0.850, p  0.007, bootstrap 99.9 confidence interval (F (1,18)  23.46,p  0.01,adjusted p value  0.01). -0.537 to -0.994, Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the effect of white matter integrity on cognitive performance generalized across experimental groups. The effects of BCAS on cognition were partly mediated by its effects on white matter integrity (indirect effect  4.670, P Sobel  0.007, bootstrap 99 confidence interval 1.55 to 13.18, Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table S3), whereas putative effects of BCAS on cognition via other mechanisms not included in the current model (referred to as direct effect) did not reach statistical significance.",

      "text": "To determine the effect of BCAS on inflammation, ionized calciumbinding adapter molecule-1 Iba-1), a marker for microglia activation, was used. Microglia quantification and morphology characterization were done in the corpus callosum of both sham operated and BCAS mice, given the imaging data pointing to the relevance of this region. Microglia quantification analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of Iba-1 cells in the corpus callosum of BCAS mice (t (23)  -3.29, p  0.003) (Fig. 4). Morphological characterization of these cells showed a significantly larger soma size (t (23)  -9.36, p  0.01 (Fig. 4). Doublecortin staining revealed somewhat lower neurogenesis in the hippocampus of BCAS mice (Fig. S7), but the difference from controls did not reach statistical significance.\nWhen examining the effects of BCAS on white matter integrity and on microglia activation at the individual mouse level, both Pearsons (Fig. 5a, r  -0.911, p  0.002) and Spearmans (Fig. 5b, r  -0.810, p  0.015) correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA) in corpus callosum (CC) (y-axis) and microglia density, assessed by the number of Iba1-positive cells per mm 3 (x-axis) were significant. Next, via mediation (path) analysis, we examined the effects of treatment on white matter integrity (FA in the CC) through microglia cell density (Iba1positive cells per mm 3 , Supplementary Table S4). As noted, focusing on the CC, undergoing BCAS resulted in significantly higher microglia density (Fig. 5c, dark blue arrow, corresponding to Fig. 4) and reduced white matter integrity (Fig. 2). The correlation presented in panel a remained nominally significant after controlling for treatment (light blue arrow), indicating that the effect of microglia density on white matter integrity could generalize across experimental groups. The total effect of BCAS on white matter integrity was largely mediated via its effect on microglia cell density (Fig. 5c, indirect effect, dotted purple arrow), whereas putative effects of BCAS on white matter integrity via other mechanisms not included in the current model (referred to as direct effect, solid purple arrow) did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Table S5). In serial mediation analysis, we examined the effects of treatment on cognition (RAWM errors on day I) through microglia cell density and then through white matter integrity (Fig. 5d). The indirect effect achieved via the serial mediation model was nominally significant (Supplementary Table S6), yet in this model indirect effects achieved through single mediation via microglia or FA were nonsignificant, consistent with the hypothesis that a prominent biological path through which BCAS leads to cognitive impairment involves microglia activation and the subsequent disruption of white matter integrity.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study we examined the effect of cerebral hypoperfusion on behavior and cognition, white matter integrity as measured by DTI and activation of microglia, in young adult male mice, as well as the correlation between behavior, imaging and histology. Reduced cerebral blood flow was induced by the BCAS procedure, whereby stenosis of both common carotid arteries is achieved by means of 0.18 mm surgical steel coils wrapped around both arteries in the course of microsurgery (Nakaji et al., 2006;Nishio et al., 2010;Shibata et al., 2004Shibata et al., , 2007;;Wolf et al., 2017). As expected, during BCAS microsurgery, CBF was dramatically reduced rostral to the implanted coil, while no change was seen in sham-operated mice (see Supplementary Fig. S1). We found a 2 and3). As noted in the main text, BCAS exerted a detrimental effect on FA in the CC (blue arrow here and Fig. 2) and on performance in the RAWM (Fig. 1). The correlation presented in panel a remained significant after controlling for treatment (light blue arrow), indicating that the effect of white matter integrity on cognitive performance generalized across experimental groups. The effects of BCAS on cognition were partly mediated via its effects on white matter integrity (indirect effect, dotted purple arrow), whereas putative effects of BCAS on cognition via other mechanisms not included in the current model (referred to as direct effect, solid purple arrow) did not reach statistical significance. r p , partial correlation coefficient, controlling for treatment; Psobel, significance of normal theory test for indirect effect (i.e. mediation).  Indirect effect is also significant at the 0.01 level using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. significant effect of BCAS on perceptual learning as measured by the novel object recognition test (Antunes and Biala, 2012). BCAS mice showed less preference for the novel object compared to control mice. In the radial arm water maze, a spatial test of hippocampal dependent learning and frontal cortex dependent reference memory (Alamed et al., 2006), BCAS mice displayed a significantly greater number of errors on the first day of testing. BCAS also had a significant effect on latency to find the platform on both test days. No significant effect of BCAS was found on weight, sucrose preference test, forced swim test, stress induced hyperthermia, elevated plus maze and open field tests indicating that in the current protocol used BCAS does not affect anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors, not does it affect general mobility.\nOur data are consistent with several previous reports of impaired cognitive function after BCAS microsurgery (e.g. Higaki et al., 2018;Shibata et al., 2007) including our own prior observations in aged female mice (Wolf et al., 2017). Shibata et al (2007) showed that BCAS mice did not improve in the 8-arm radial maze upon repeated practice and made significantly more errors compared to control mice. Similar findings were reported by Holland et al, (2015) and Nishio et al. (2010). BCAS mice showed significantly lower spatial learning ability compared to sham operated mice. In accordance with our results, a decrease in novel object preference in the NOR test has been reported by other groups (Khan et al., 2018;Miyanohara et al., 2018).\nIn ex-vivo MRI studies we measured the effect of BCAS microsurgery on white and grey matter using DTI. BCAS had a significant effect on DTI parameters primarily in white matter areas. Lower FA values were found in the corpus callosum and anterior commissure of BCAS mice compared to controls. Higher MD values were found in the corpus callosum, internal capsule and fimbria of BCAS mice. Effects of BCAS on grey matter were minimal. These results are consistent with previous findings in vascular dementia and small vessel disease models, in which FA and MD values were altered in the hypoperfusion group. Holland et al. (2015) reported significantly reduced FA in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and fimbria, but significantly increased FA in the subcortical regions of hypo-perfused mice (BCAS). No significant change was seen in MD in any of the regions. Saggu et al. (2016) showed significantly reduced white matter FA values in mice subjected to BCAS compared to sham-treated mice. Similar observations have been made in vascular dementia patients. Xu et al. ( 2010) reported significant abnormalities of MD and FA among patients diagnosed with subcortical ischemic vascular disease. Although no change was seen in hippocampal or whole brain white matter volume, Zarei et al. (2009) showed that white matter FA values in anterior corpus callosum, frontal and parietal white matter areas in vascular dementia patients were significantly reduced compared to healthy controls. However, only a trend was observed when vascular dementia patients were compared to patients with Alzheimers disease, consistent with known overlap between these disorders. Kim et al. (2015) reported that patients with subcortical vascular dementia had decreased FA and increased MD across all white matter regions except occipital regions.\nFrom the three DTI parameters that reached significance after multiple comparisons adjustment, we focused on the corpus callosum for further analysis. Both Pearsons and Spearmans correlations between FA in the corpus callosum and cognition were significant and remained so after controlling for treatment. The effects of BCAS on cognition were partly mediated by its effects on white matter integrity. Moreover, BCAS-operated mice displayed marked microglia activation, which was negatively correlated with white matter integrity at the individual mouse level. Finally, serial mediation analysis was consistent with the hypothesis that a prominent biological path through which BCAS leads to cognitive impairment involves microglia activation and subsequent disruption of white matter integrity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, correlation at the individual mouse level between histology, imaging and cognition, followed by path analysis, is highly novel in the context of the BCAS model and bolster its construct validity. Madden et al. (2009) applied mediation analysis to study the mechanistic links between age related white matter deficits and cognitive decline. Implementing a task-switching paradigm in the MRI while scanning young and older adults, they found that age-covaried FA values from the genu center and splenium-parietal of the corpus callosum were both significant mediators of performance. Mediation models have become common in other fields for neuroscience, for instance, when assessing the potential role of methylation as a mediator of childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity (Houtepen et al., 2016). Other reports have shown correlation between MRI, histology and behavior in different vascular dementia models. For example, a correlation of microhemorrhages detected by MRI and microhemorrhages detected by Prussian blue staining in a model of induced cerebral hemorrhages (Sudduth et al., 2013) has been reported. Moreover, mice subjected to right unilateral common carotid artery occlusion exhibited significant WM damage in the corpus callosum, and deficits in object recognition test were correlated with the damage of frontal-subcortical circuits (Yoshizaki et al., 2008). Our findings are thus consistent with human studies that support a link between microstructural changes, shown by DTI parameters, and decline in cognitive function.\nDue to the low number of animals in the ex-vivo MRI analysis and the procedure of removing the brains from the skull, we used ROI based analyses and were not able to use voxel by voxel analysis. As a result we may have missed some relevant data. Further studies using in vivo or in skull ex vivo imaging could add new information about mechanism and behavioral phenotype. Moreover, the correlation and mediation analysis were done on a small number of animals (n  9). In order to mitigate this problem we used bootstrap confidence intervals for the partial correlation and indirect effects, since resampling statistics are largely independent of data distribution and could be more robust in small samples such as ours (Darlington and Hayes, 2017). In addition, we are aware that the lack of information about cerebral blood flow profile is a limitation of this study. However, the measurement of cerebral blood flow in young adult male mice subject to BCAS microsurgery has been well characterized, with 18-mm coils inducing consistent blood flow reductions in this age group (Shibata et al., 2004(Shibata et al., , 2007)). Doublecortin (DCX) staining revealed a reduced number of newly formed neurons in the slices examined from the DG of the hippocampus in BCAS mice compared to controls; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. A previous study reported hippocampal atrophy after cerebral hypoperfusion of longer duration (8 months) (Nishio et al., 2010). With respect to microglia, in addition to density elevations BCAS-treated mice displayed larger soma size, likely reflecting microglial activation. In line with previous reports by our group (Wolf et al., 2017) and others (Coltman et al., 2011;McQueen et al., 2014;Miyanohara et al., 2018), the present data are consistent with the predilection of the BCAS paradigm towards white matter lesions (ter Telgte et al., 2018), highlighting its unique translational relevance to VaD in humans.\nIschemic insults due to cerebral hypoperfusion could activate several cellular mechanisms that damage the brain. Prominent among those is neuro-inflammation triggered by microglia and astrocytes. Following such insults, microglia become activated and present enlarged soma size. Such activated microglia can aggravate the inflammation by secreting inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and glutamate, and assume enhanced phagocytic properties (López-Valdés and Martínez-Coria, 2016) leading to white matter disruption and neuronal death. Given our histology data, it is likely that microglial activation mediated some of the structural and behavioral 5). As noted, focusing on the CC, undergoing BCAS resulted in significantly higher microglia density (dark blue arrow, corresponding to Fig. 4) and reduced white matter integrity (Fig. 2). The correlation presented in panel a remained nominally significant after controlling for treatment (light blue arrow), indicating that the effect of microglia density on white matter integrity generalized across experimental groups. The total effect of BCAS on white matter integrity was largely mediated via its effect on microglia cell density (indirect effect, dotted purple arrow), whereas putative effects of BCAS on white matter integrity via other mechanisms not included in the current model (referred to as direct effect, solid purple arrow) did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Table 6). d) Serial mediation analysis, examining the effects of treatment on cognition (RAWM errors on day I) through microglia cell density and then through white matter integrity. The indirect effect achieved via the serial mediation model was nominally significant (Supplementary Table 7), yet in this model indirect effects achieved through single mediation via microglia or FA were non-significant, consistent with the hypothesis that the biological path through which BCAS leads to cognitive impairment involves microglia activation and subsequent disruption of white matter integrity. r p , partial correlation coefficient, controlling for treatment;  (Nominally) significant at the 0.1 level and  significant at the 0.01 level using bootstrap-based confidence intervals. To enhance clarity, indirect and direct effects presented were completely standardized. effects of the BCAS paradigm.\nTolerability of the BCAS procedure should be taken into account in interpreting the results of this study. Fifteen out of 17 sham operated animals survived the protocol (two were taken out of the experiment due to aggressive behavior). In contrast, 6 out of 21 BCAS mice died throughout the experiment (28.5 mortality rate). Three of the deaths were within 48 h of surgery; the rest were later in the experiment. This unexpectedly high mortality rate may lead to a selection bias, and increased probability of type two error. It is possible that due to the high mortality rate mainly milder cases survived and were included in the analysis whereas the cases in which BCAS microsurgery induced the most severe damage and impairment did not survive and were excluded. Nevertheless, In spite of this concern, we were able to demonstrate significant effects of BCAS on behavioral, histological and imaging parameters. Previous experiments with male mice (10 weeks old) reported a 15 mortality rate with 0.18 mm coil implants (Shibata et al., 2004). However, other recent papers have reported zero mortality for young male mice in the BCAS operation (Hattori et al., 2014(Hattori et al., , 2016)). Our results may be explained to some extent by anesthesia methods andor sex differences. Other reports have used isoflurane as the anesthesia method (Hattori et al., 2014(Hattori et al., , 2016;;McQueen et al., 2014;Miyanohara et al., 2018) while we used ketamine-xylazine. This anesthesia method may be too intense for young mice, particularly males. It is also possible that in our hands young adult male mice are more sensitive to the BCAS surgery. In our previous study (Wolf et al., 2017), BCAS surgery by the same surgeon was associated with zero mortality under anesthesia with ketamine-xylazine in young female mice.\nOverall, the results of this study indicate that cerebral hypoperfusion due to BCAS microsurgery is associated with cognitive deficits that are related to microglial activation and subsequent disruption of white matter integrity. Young male mice that underwent BCAS showed reduced discriminative index and impaired spatial and working memory. They also displayed marked microglia activation in white matter, which was correlated with white matter integrity. Taken together, we have replicated our previous results with this model (Wolf et al., 2017) and those of other (Coltman et al., 2011;Higaki et al., 2018;Nakaji et al., 2006;Nishio et al., 2010;McQueen et al., 2014;Miyanohara et al., 2018;Saggu et al., 2016Shibata et al., 2004, 2007) and have extended previous findings by linking inflammation and subsequent white matter changes to cognitive function. Our data bolster the growing body of evidence regarding the face and construct validity of the BCAS procedure, positioning it as a promising model for assessing of novel treatments for VaD.",

The novel object test took place 1 h following the sample object exposure. Mice were returned to the arena, which contained the sample object and a novel object for 4 min. The ratio of exploration of the novel object and the total exploration of the two objects were calculated. Novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed during the 2nd week of the behavioral battery, using Ethovision 11 system, providing fully computerized, blinded and unbiased measurement.",

Microglial activation was determined by measuring soma (cell body) area using X40 magnification. This analysis was performed on 5-10 randomly selected cellssection. Soma area of microglia was measured in pixels and multiplied by µmpixel to reflect soma size in millimeters. In addition, microglia cells were counted in a defined area of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure using X20 magnification, multiplied by the number of stacks and normalized to mm 3 . Doublecortin images were captured using an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope and camera (Tokyo, Japan). The number of DCX marked cells was manually counted at x20 in a defined area containing the granular cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampus. DCX marked cells were counted twice by an observer blind to age and exposure. Number of visible DCX-stained cells was divided by the GCL volume. Volume of GCL was calculated as following: (GCL area  number of stacks  stack spacing  µmpixels 2 )10 9 . All histological staining and visualization were performed by a researcher who was blind to the experimental conditions of the specimens.

These models were: 1) Analysis of the RAWM test that included time (Day 1 and Day 2, within factor) and treatment (BCAS and control, between factors) as independent variables, together with time-by-treatment as interaction term 2) Analysis of the MRI measures (FA and MD) that included hemisphere (left hemisphere and right hemisphere, within factor) and treatment (BCAS and control, between factor) as independent variables, together with hemisphere-by-treatment as interaction term. These analyses were followed by post-hoc simple effects analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 and an alpha level of p  0.05 was considered as statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons using false discover rate (FDR).\nExploring the relationship between BCAS, DTI, cognition and histology via mediation analysis: We employed several multiple linear regression models, with treatment (BCAS vs. control) and DTI (FA in the CC) as independent variables and cognitive performance (errors on day I of the RAWM) as the dependent variable (corresponding to Fig. 3) or DTI (FA in the CC) as dependent variable and Iba-1 density as the independent variable (corresponding to Fig. 5). To control for effects of treatment, partial correlation between DTI and cognition was calculated, and, significance ascertained using bootstrap-derived confidence intervals with stratification according to treatment. In mediation analysis, significance of indirect effects of treatment on cognition via DTI and on DTI via microglia density were estimated using bootstrap-derived confidence intervals. Mediation analysis was performed using Model 4 (Fig. 3c and Fig. 5c) and Model 6 (Fig. 5d) of the PROCESS 2.16.1 Macro for SPSS.",

Pacemaker and ferromagnetic metal material in the body were additional exclusion criteria for MRI scanning. Based on the structured interview, participants who were currently engaged in a regular sport activity that was more frequently practised andor more demanding than our intensive dance-exercise intervention were not included. All participants signed an informed consent form that had been approved by the ethics committee of Masaryk University in Brno.\nSubjects were randomly assigned into two groups: dance intervention (DI) and life as usual (LAU). For the demographic data of our DI cohort of subjects (n  31) who completed at least 60 of the whole DI programme, and the LAU group (n  31), see Table 1. The groups were matched for all major demographic and clinical aspects, including age, proportion of MCI, gender distribution, length of education, physical fitness and global cognitive performance.",

Each exercise unit consisted of training single dance steps first without music on counting at a low pace (starting with distinct movements of legs and arms). Afterwards, single dance steps were connected into small units which gradually became faster. After reaching the desired pace, the music was added. After having learned the whole choreography, changes of tempo, formations, dancers positions and spatial arrangement were practised. The DI programme was performed at a medium physical load intensity, supervised by an experienced tutor, and adjusted to the current health condition and physical fitness of individual seniors. The topic was Travelling Around the World; units included folk, country, African, Greek and tango dancing. The whole choreography was divided into smaller blocks that were gradually taught in individual lessons and modified and changed over time.",

In case of significant results, a subsequent mixed-design ANOVA analysis was performed with time (two timepoints) as a within-subject variable, intervention (DI or LAU) as a between-subject factor and age as a covariate. To examine the unique variance the intervention had on test results, linear regression analyses were performed using the (Time2-Time1)-first score residuals as a dependent variable.\nSpecifically, in the first analysis, the difference score was used as a dependent variable and the first score as an independent variable.

Maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated.\nAfter the above-mentioned preprocessing and quality control, the data underwent tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). 23 FA images of all subjects were nonlinearly registered to FMRIB58_FA_1mm target image and then affine transformed to the 1  1  1 mm MNI152 standard space.

Other diffusion measures (MD, RD and AD) were processed using the information from the FA procedure. Individual maps were nonlinearly registered to common space and projected onto the original mean FA skeleton. The general linear model design with non-parametric permutation test (5000 permutations) was performed by the Randomize tool. 24 Age, gender, years of education and relative measure of brain atrophy were included as covariates of no interest.\nMoreover, we performed exploratory whole-brain analysis in order to evaluate group differences in the percentage change in skeleton images of parameters FA, MD, RD and AD. 25 First, the percentage change (Tpost-TpreTpre) for each parameter was calculated, and then, the non-parametric permutation test in the Randomize tool in FSL was performed. 24",

      "text": "Supervised dancing with changing choreography is a joyful complex motor-cognitive activity that particularly encompasses learning new skilled whole-body movements through action observation of others and specific movement imitation. 26 Based on the inferior parietal and intraparietal regions, including the core mirror neurons system (MNS), 28 as well as particularly the right temporooccipital areas also referred to as the lateral occipitotemporal cortex. 29 In line with this notion, we provide initial descriptions of increased cortical thickness induced by DI as compared to LAU in the cluster encompassing the right inferior temporal, fusiform and lateral occipitotemporal gyri. The right fusiform body area that is part of this cluster is involved during both observation and imitation of non-hand actions, particularly during whole-body actions. 27 The right-sided lateralization accords with the right hemisphere specialization for tasks in which spatial metrics play an essential role. 30 Based on the results of the functional parcellation of the temporal cortex, 31 our posterior inferior temporal cluster is broadly connected to regions associated with modality-specific processing in the visual, auditory and motor domains engaged in the ventral visual, auditory-motor and dorsal attention networks, all implicated in learning new skilled dancing movements.\nWe are aware of only three studies that assessed effects of six-month or eighteen-month DI in healthy seniors as compared to control intervention groups using structural MRI. None of the studies employed CT; instead, voxel-based morphometry was used. MCI subjects were not included or identified by detailed cognitive examination. The six-month intervention induced changes particularly in the sensorimotor, cingulate and insular cortices. 32,33 However, the sample sizes of these studies are rather small (maximum of 22 subjects per group) and reported results are uncorrected and thus preliminary in nature. Of note, some preliminary data suggest that the longer eighteen-month DI programme might induce additional changes in the hippocampus, 32,34 resembling the results of aerobic exercise on hippocampal neuroplasticity. 3,35 Some studies reported subtle cognitive improvements, particularly in attention and executive functions, due to DI 3637383940 ; however, all the aforementioned MRI studies did not reveal any cognitive improvement in the DI group that would surpass that of the control group. We found a positive effect of DI on the Five-Point Test which evaluates nonverbal (figural) fluency. 11 Figural fluency reflects divergent thinking, attention division, planning and mental flexibility, that is executive functions. Executive functions and specifically figural fluency are known to decline in Alzheimers disease and even in healthy ageing. 41 Our results accord with preliminary results of Coubard et al 36 be more significant after a longer DI period. 25 Future studies might include tests more sensitive to assess the potential distinct effects of DI such as the dance imitation task performance. This task has been shown to correlate with CT in the right lateral temporal cortex. 42 In addition to CT changes, we observed increased RD and MD only in the DI group; however, the per cent changes in the DI group were not significantly different from the changes in the LAU group.\nWe cannot draw any firm conclusions from these results. Of note, available studies comparing young professionally trained dancers with non-dancers have also shown increased RD, 1 particularly in the sensorimotor pathways (corticospinal tract), the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), that is in the same regions that were identified by our study in the DI group. The SLF is considered to be the major cortical association fibre pathway that interconnects frontal, temporo-occipital and parietal association areas 43 and plays a role in regulating motor learning and higher aspects of motor behaviour. Increases in RD were significant when professional dancers were compared to non-dancers but also to agematched professional musicians. This result suggests that dancing as a complex activity may differ from other activities in engaging distinct brain regions and pathways. 1 Thus, the training-related changes in the microstructure of WM pathways may reflect greater axonal diameter andor different patterns of crossing fibres (fibre fanning) 1 or they may reflect white matter degeneration with time. In the only published randomized controlled study employing six-month DI and DTI measures, the authors reported increased FA in the fornix in the DI as compared to the control group, while in accordance with our results, RD and MD increased with time similarly in both groups. 26 This is the first study showing the results of DI as compared to lifetime activities as usual in elderly subjects including those with MCI. We demonstrated that complex dancing-exercise activities induced subtle positive effect on executive functions and distinct changes in the temporo-occipital regions engaged in action observation, visuomotor integration and action imitation, which are important for motor learning and executing new skilled movements. Intensive DI may have induced specific cortical thickening by modulating brain plasticity and vasculature 44 and may have potential to counteract grey matter changes in areas that typically undergo degeneration prior to the onset of AD symptoms 45,46 and predict future cognitive impairment. 47",

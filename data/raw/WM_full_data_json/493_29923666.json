    "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has been predominantly considered as a frontotemporal cortical disease, with limited direct investigation of frontal-subcortical connections. We aim to characterize the grey and white matter components of frontal-thalamic and frontal-striatal circuits in bvFTD. Twenty-four patients with bvFTD and 24 healthy controls underwent morphological and diffusion imaging. Subcortical structures were manually segmented according to published protocols. Probabilistic pathways were reconstructed separately from the dorsolateral, orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex to the striatum and thalamus. Patients with bvFTD had smaller cortical and subcortical volumes, lower fractional anisotropy, and higher mean diffusivity metrics, which is consistent with disruptions in frontal-striatal-thalamic pathways. Unexpectedly, regional volumes of the striatum and thalamus connected to the medial prefrontal cortex were significantly larger in bvFTD (by 135 in the striatum, p 5 .032, and 217 in the thalamus, p 5 .004), despite smaller dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected regional volumes (by 67 in the striatum, p 5 .002, and 65 in the thalamus, p 5 .020), and inconsistent changes in orbitofrontal cortex connected regions. These unanticipated findings may represent compensatory or maladaptive remodeling in bvFTD networks. Comparisons are made to other neuropsychiatric disorders suggesting a common mechanism of changes in frontalsubcortical networks; however, longitudinal studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

      "text": "Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus -Yesterdays rose stands only in its name, we hold only empty names\nThe Name of the Rose -Umberto Eco 1  I N TR ODU C TI ON Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common frontotemporal dementia subtype, with deficits in executive functioning, social cognition, and alterations to behavior (Piguet, Hornberger, Mioshi,  Hodges, 2011). Although frontal and temporal cortical lobar degeneration is a defining and diagnostic criterion of the disease (Rascovsky et al., 2011), atrophy of the caudate, putamen, and thalamus is also well described (Chow et al., 2008;Garibotto et al., 2011;Gordon, Rohrer,  Fox, 2016;Halabi et al., 2013;Landin-Romero et al., 2016;Looi et al., 2008Looi et al., , 2009;;OCallaghan, Bertoux,  Hornberger, 2014). Given this degeneration across nodes in frontalstriatal-thalamic circuits (Alexander, DeLong,  Strick, 1986), bvFTD has progressively been recast as a disorder of cortical-subcortical circuits, rather than isolated cortical disease alone (Bertoux, OCallaghan, Flanagan, Hodges,  Hornberger, 2015;Looi et al., 2012;Schroeter, Raczka, Neumann,  von Cramon, 2008;Schroeter et al., 2014;Seeley, Crawford, Zhou, Miller,  Greicius, 2009).\nFrontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic circuits are well described in healthy populations and have associations with behavioral alterations in disease. Frontal-striatal tracts have been segmented with both structural (Draganski et al., 2008) and functional (Choi, Yeo,  Buckner, 2012) imaging, with separate divisions of these tracts demonstrated depending on their cortical origin. Striatal and thalamic terminations of these tracts can be mapped in a topographic manner in both exclusive (Draganski et al., 2008) and overlapping (Jarbo  Verstynen, 2015) regions. Similarly, frontal-thalamic tracts can also be divided based on cortical origin (Klein et al., 2010) and terminate in different regions of the thalamus (Behrens et al., 2003;Jang  Yeo, 2014). These frontal subcortical structural connections are implicated in varied neurodegenerative disease processes. Although the frontal cortex is implicated in execution of goal-directed behavior (Piray, Toni,  Cools, 2016), breakdown in either subcortical nodes or the frontal-subcortical connections is associated with similar behavioral deficits (Bhatia  Marsden, 1994).\nThus, our interest expands to the different subdivisions of frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic pathways.\nDespite the established cortical effects of bvFTD and the known topographical correspondence between cortical and subcortical structures, the cortical-subcortical connectivity in bvFTD is incompletely investigated. A voxel based morphometry study examined indirect cortical-striatal connectivity and found correlated atrophy between frontal regions (ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and connected striatal regions (Bertoux et al., 2015) using atlas-based divisions of the striatum. However, this atlas-based measure may not distinguish between different frontal-striatal divisions. Similarly, our previous striatal morphology analysis in bvFTD demonstrated striatal atrophy predominantly in anterior regions of the caudate (Macfarlane et al., 2015).\nThese regions connect to the prefrontal cortex, and thus also provide indirect structural evidence of localized node atrophy in frontal-striatal pathways. Nevertheless, direct examination of structural white matter pathways between the frontal cortex and striatum in bvFTD is lacking.\nThe white matter microstructure of frontal-thalamic connections has been explored with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with bvFTD patients demonstrating lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and higher axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) (Daianu et al., 2016;Mahoney et al., 2014;M oller et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2009). However, quantification of the metrics across different divisions of the anterior thalamic radiation has not been explored. Lastly, evidence from functional imaging in bvFTD is conflicting. Zhou et al. (2010) found increased default mode network activity, yet decreased Salience Network activation between the cortex, putamen, and thalamus. More recently Farb et al. (2013) reported increased functional activity between the medial prefrontal cortex and the striatum. In summary, there is fragmentary evidence of altered frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic pathway integrity and functioning in bvFTD, although the integrity of these pathways has not been sufficiently investigated.\nThe aim of this study is to comprehensively describe the structural frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic pathways in bvFTD at an individual level by using probabilistic tractography. We hypothesize that bvFTD patients, compared to controls, will (a) have impaired white matter microstructure, as measured via diffusion tensor imaging metrics, in frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic pathways; (b) exhibit atrophy of regions of the striatum and thalamus which connect to prefrontal areas; and (c) these imaging findings are associated with clinical and behavioral measures.",

Cortical masks were extracted based on parcellation regions of interest (ROI) using the Desikan-Killiany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006) and are displayed in Figure 1. Striatal and thalamic volumes were manually defined using established protocols with excellent reliability. The caudate (Looi et al., 2008) and putamen (Looi et al., 2009) were segmented separately in ITK-SNAP software (Yushkevich et al., 2006). We used the combined segmentation of the caudate and putamen for subsequent analyses as their connectivity and function are closely related (Draganski et al., 2008). Thalamic segmentations were performed using ANALYZE software (Mayo Biomedical Imaging Resource, Rochester, MN) using T1 sequences (and inversed T1 images) to delineate the boundaries (Power et al., 2015).\nVolume registration was performed to correct for eddy current distortion using FSL eddy_correct script (Smith et al., 2004;Woolrich et al., 2009), and b vectors rotated accordingly (Leemans  Jones, 2009). Diffusion maps (FA, AD, RD, and MD) were created with FSL DTIFIT package.\nNonlinear registration was performed between structural, diffusion, and standard space images using FSL FNIRT tool (Andersson, Jenkinson,  Smith, 2012). The T1 images were registered to diffusion images, acquired with b 5 0 smm 2 , using nonlinear registration to account for distortions in the echo planar imaging volumes. Additionally, T1 images were registered to standard MNI152 images also using nonlinear registration to account for increased ventricle size in bvFTD participants. These transforms were inverted and concatenated to transform images between spaces. Segmentations transformed to MNI space were manually checked for accuracy.",

    "Tractography": {
      "text": "Probabilistic tractography was performed within each participants diffusion space. For each target structure (striatum and thalamus), we generated streamline probability distribution maps from each frontal region (DLPFC, MPFC, and OFC). In each map the frontal region was specified as seed, striatum or thalamus as target, and contralateral white matter as exclusion mask. Frontal regions and subcortical segmentations were obtained by transforming them from standard and structural space, respectively, into diffusion space using previously generated registrations.\nFor computation of DTI metrics of pathways, we adapted the methodology of Nakamae et al. (2014). Briefly, probabilistic tractography was performed using BedpostX (Jbabdi, Woolrich, Andersson,  Behrens, 2007) with default parameters. Pathway probability maps were normalized for seed size by dividing the probability maps by the total number of successfully generated streamlines (the waytotal), and spurious connections were removed by thresholding the resulting maps by 10. Thresholded probability maps were then binarized and overlaid on DTI metric maps (FA, AD, RD, and MD) from which average values were extracted.\nFor analysis of subcortical regional volumes, we used diffusion target classification (as in Behrens et al., 2003). That is, probabilistic tractography was carried out between frontal seeds and striatal and thalamic targets, separately. This allowed us to determine which areas within the striatum and thalamus were predominantly connected to which frontal area. To remove false-positives, we thresholded the connectivity maps by the top 10 (as in Bohanna, Georgiou-Karistianis,  Egan, 2011) before calculating the final volume. We also conducted analyses with threshold levels of 5 and 20 with similar findings. Mixed models were utilized for all subsequent analyses, with hemisphere treated as a repeated factor to examine for structural asymmetry. In all analyses, age, gender, and years of education were standardized and included as covariates. For volumetric analyses, we utilized estimated total intracranial volume as a covariate to normalize for brain volume.",

Models were specified with random intercepts. Hemisphere was included as a repeated factor considering possible lateralization in bvFTD (Gordon et al., 2016) and to reduce the number of comparisons, thus allowing us to test for abnormal lateralization utilizing a group-by-hemisphere interaction term. We calculated an effect size measure comparable to Cohens d using the difference between estimated marginal means proportional to the estimated standard deviation of control participants. DTI metrics and volumes were compared between groups with statistical significance considered when p  .05. For bvFTD patients only, we specified models which predicted DTI metrics or volumes based on FTLD-CDR-SB measure and FBI total score predictors using mixed models. Due to the number of comparisons with these behavioral tests, we used a more stringent p value of .004 (.05 divided by four different measures for three different pathways).",

      "text": "In this study, we utilized individual probabilistic pathway reconstructions in a novel demonstration of altered frontal-striatal and frontalthalamic connectivity in bvFTD. The key findings are the alteration of the frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic white matter in bvFTD, and despite this, there is a selective increase of the MPFC connected regions in the striatum and thalamus. Our findings not only broaden the conceptual understanding of the specific neuro-pathophysiology of bvFTD, but may also illustrate neural circuit phenomena that may be common to frontal network system disorders.\nWe have demonstrated substantively altered white matter microstructure, as measured via diffusion tensor imaging metrics, for most divisions within the frontal-striatal and frontal-thalamic pathways.\nFibers from the three frontal regions pass either directly to the striatum or within the anterior thalamic radiation to the thalamus. As a whole, altered white matter microstructure of the anterior thalamic radiation has been found in previous work (Daianu et al., 2016;Mahoney et al., 2014;M oller et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2009). Moreover, we found that altered white matter microstructure, as measured via DTI metrics, was found in a similar magnitude and across all anatomical divisions in frontal-striatal projections, which to our knowledge, has yet to be empirically demonstrated in bvFTD. These frontal-striatal pathways involve predominantly cortical efferent projections, as opposed to the mixed cortical-thalamic efferent and afferent projections within the anterior thalamic radiation. These findings may stem from direct neuropathological afflictions of white matter, which are present in the dominant bvFTD proteinopathies (i.e., tau and TDP-43) (Mackenzie  Neumann, 2016), or alternatively via direct and indirect deafferentation (i.e., downstream structural change in a brain region secondary to the interruption of afferent neuronal stimulation; Looi  Walterfang, 2013).\nRegardless of the pathological mechanisms, these findings highlight the importance of conceptualizing bvFTD as a dysfunction of cortical and subcortical transmission, in contrast to the prevailing cortico-cortical transmission focus.\nOur gross volumetric findings reproduced the well-known atrophy of prefrontal and subcortical volumes in bvFTD (Chow et al., 2008;Garibotto et al., 2011;Gordon et al., 2016;Halabi et al., 2013;Landin-Romero et al., 2016;Looi et al., 2008Looi et al., , 2009;;OCallaghan et al., 2014).\nOur innovation is in demonstrating connectivity through the parcellation of striatal and thalamic regions which connect to prefrontal regions in bvFTD. As hypothesized, we demonstrate smaller DLPFC connected regions in the striatum and thalamus, and smaller OFC connected regions in the striatum only.\nIn contradistinction to the primarily atrophic changes, the regions of the striatum and thalamus which connect to the medial prefrontal cortex are significantly increased in size. This is despite a globalized decrease in volume, largely similar in magnitude, across all prefrontal and subcortical regions of interest in the bvFTD group (Table 2), and a similar degree of affliction of tracts generated from these regions (Tables 3 and4). As explained more fully below, we chose to interpret this as structural hyperconnectivity, either as a primary pathological phenomenon, or more probably, as either compensatory or maladaptive phenomenon. Our novel finding of increased volume in MPFC connected regions requires consideration of possible confounding factors. The recurrent frontal-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitry is a structurally complex segregated parallel system which limits the extent in which it can be imaged in its full. The DLPFC pathways predominantly aggregate in the Muratoff bundle to the caudate, whereas the OFC and MPFC pathways predominantly traverse the external capsule to the putamen (Forkel et al., 2014;Schmahmann  Pandya, 2009). This corresponds with the pathways seen in Figure 2. For the frontal-thalamic connections we used, these proceed via the anterior thalamic radiation and our divisions match those previously published (Jang  Yeo, 2014).\nThus, on visual inspection, these pathways are correctly specified.\nMoreover, our frontal connectivity-based parcellation of striatal and thalamic subregions is generally consistent with previous studies for both structures (Behrens et al., 2003;Draganski et al., 2008;Tziortzi et al., 2013), thus providing validation to our tractography methodology. Moreover, obtained DTI metrics are comparable to frontal probabilistic tractography in other conditions (Nakamae et al., 2014).\nNevertheless, it should be noted that our parcellations in Figure 3 are not identical to previous studies due to the cortical regions (i.e., only the DLPFC, MPC, and OFC) we chose to utilize for this study. Thus, sensory, motor, and visual cortical regions are missing when compared to more comprehensive cortical parcellation schemes (Behrens et al., 2003;Draganski et al., 2008).\nThe other potential confounding factor for increased MFPC volume is the use of probabilistic tractography based on streamline propagation and diffusion tensor imaging (Jones  Cercignani, 2010).\nIncreased volume in downstream regions may be attributed to increased streamline generation; however, we note that all frontal areas had a decrease in volume of equivalent magnitude in bvFTD (Table 2), thus leading to fewer streamline generation for all frontal regions.\nNevertheless, we normalized all tracts by streamline counts. Additionally, streamline propagation may be paradoxically increased when these crossing fibers degenerate. However, all frontal-striatal and frontalthalamic tracts course approximately orthogonally to the corpus callosum, the largest perpendicular interhemispheric fiber bundle. Moreover, change in the DTI metrics seen does not necessarily imply a larger reduction of crossing fibers in the MPFC generated tracts (Jones  Cercignani, 2010), as seen in Tables 2 and3 Findings from functional imaging provide support for our results and our interpretation of selective structural hyperconnectivity. Potentially congruent with our findings of selectively increased MPFC connectivity, there has been demonstration of increased functional activity of the default mode network in parallel with decreased salience network activity in bvFTD (Zhou et al., 2010). Given that the default mode network is characteristically anchored in the rostral anterior cingulum ventral-medial prefrontal cortex, which is included in our MPFC region (Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss,  Menon, 2003), this correlates with our suggestion of increased structural connectivity between MPFC and subcortical structures. Moreover, despite expected reductions in salience network connectivity in bvFTD, Farb et al. (2013) noted MPFC functional hyperconnectivity, which was additionally related to apathy and disinhibition.\nOur findings of increased target area volume of the MPFC connections require some consideration of possible underlying cellular changes. In both the basal ganglia and thalamus, cortical representation zones are not clear cut but overlap with neighboring ones (Draganski et al., 2008), which provides a foundation for an expansion of apparent connected volume without resorting to an increased number of axons.\nInstead, most likely phenomena are increased myelination andor axonal remodelingbranching of existing neighboring connections, which are plasticity phenomena present in the adult brain know to influence DTI parameters (Zatorre, Fields,  Johansen-Berg, 2012). We propose that the observed increase in MPFC connectivity to striatal and thalamic regions provides structural evidence of this functional hyperconnectivity.\nOur findings may shed light on, and be informed by, conditions which have common themes of behavioral dysregulation. Evidence stems from conditions involving hyperconnective MPFC andor corresponding nodes in subcortical networks, implied either by increased regional size or increased functional connectivity. Structurally, in Parkinsons disease with impulse control disorders, Tessitore et al. (2016) found increased medial prefrontal cortex thickness compared to patients without impulse control disorders. Repetitive behaviors were associated with increased caudate size in persons with autism (Hollander et al., 2005). Furthermore, increased activity in direct frontalstriatal-thalamic pathways are noted in obsessive compulsive disorder (Pauls, Abramovitch, Rauch,  Geller, 2014) and unmedicated trichotillomania (Chamberlain et al., 2008). Last, in disorders of addiction, overactivity of the limbic cortical-subcortical loop is thought to be responsible for the compulsivity of this disorder (Volkow  Morales, 2015). In summary, selective hyperfunctioning of frontal circuits are likely involved in multiple pathophysiologic processes which result in behavioral dysregulation (Peters, Dunlop,  Downar, 2016), and particularly compulsive behaviors (Fineberg et al., 2010); these behaviors are signature clinical features of bvFTD.\nDespite the findings of consistently altered diffusion metrics across tracts, reduced DLPFC connected region size, and increased MPFC connected region size, there were few significant correlations observed with behavioral measures. No clear-cut correlation pattern emerged, which may due to our divisions of cortical and subcortical regions being too specific to capture the more comprehensive FBI scale. Furthermore, from a connectivity perspective, directionality of thalamic-cortical and cortical-thalamic tracts cannot be separated by conventional DTI imaging, and so may have confounded these correlations. Nevertheless, gross severity as measured by the FTLD-CDR-SB was significantly associated with multiple MPFC-striatal tract diffusion metrics, possibly highlighting the importance for this axis in the disease process.\nA limitation of our current approach is the a priori neuroanatomical and functional tripartite division of the frontal-striatal-thalamic circuits in DLPFC, MPFC, and OFC based projections. This is reasonable since this division is utilized in previous studies investigating the striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus, and in tracts in-between (Behrens et al., 2003;Bertoux et al., 2015;Draganski et al., 2008). Furthermore, we\nwere not able to correct for echo planar imaging distortions, since at the time of study design additional sequences necessary for correction (Smith et al., 2004) were not obtained. Instead, we utilized nonlinear transformations to reduce distortions, and in control participants our pathways and subcortical classification are consistent with previous work (e.g., frontal seed probabilistic tractography in Nakamae et al., 2014) and existing atlases (Behrens et al., 2003;Draganski et al., 2008), suggesting that this methodological limitation was minimized.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cognitive decline is age relevant and it can start as early as middle age. The decline becomes more obvious among older adults, which is highly associated with increased risk of developing dementia (e.g., Alzheimers disease). White matter damage was found to be related to cognitive decline through aging. The purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of Tai Chi (TC) versus walking on the brain white matter network among Chinese elderly women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted where 42 healthy elderly women were included. Tai Chi practitioners (20 females, average age: 62.9  2.38 years, education level 9.05  1.8 years) and the matched walking participants (22 females, average age: 63.27  3.58 years, educational level: 8.86  2.74 years) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) scans. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theory were employed to study the data, construct the white matter matrix, and compare the brain network attributes between the two groups. Results: Results from graph-based analyses showed that the small-world attributes were higher for the TC group than for the walking group (p  0.05, Cohens d  1.534). Some effects were significant (p  0.001) with very large effect sizes. Meanwhile, the aggregation coefficient and local efficiency attributes were also higher for the TC group than for the walking group (p  0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in node attributes and edge analysis. Conclusion: Regular TC training is more conducive to optimize the brain functioning and networking of the elderly. The results of the current study help to identify the mechanisms underlying the cognitive protective effects of TC.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Aging is associated with serious changes in neurocognition. For instance, age-related cognitive decline can start as early as in ones 20s and 30s and becomes more obvious among older adults 1. When the age-related cognitive decline becomes sufficiently serious, it is highly associated with increased risk of developing dementia (e.g., Alzheimers disease) 234. As cognition relies on proper brain functioning, it is natural to assume that the aging-related changes in cognition may be accompanied by age-related changes in the brain, too. Indeed, solid evidence shows that aging leads to considerable changes in functional connectivity and grey matter as well as white matter in the human brain 5,6. In this context, a recent study showed that there is a significant ageing-related loss of white matter volume in fronto-striatal projections 7. The white matter plays a key role in cognitive processes because it connects different grey matter regions throughout the human brain 8. The important role of white matter in cognition is buttressed by the evidence that white matter damage was found to be related to cognitive decline through aging and that reduced integrity of white matter is associated with worsening of cognitive performance (e.g., executive functions, information processing speed) 91011. Furthermore, older individuals are more cognitively deficient than other individuals. Such differences were thought to be caused by brain networks with cognitively deficient older individuals tending to recruit a similar brain network as young adults but used it ineffectively, whereas cognitively deficient older adults compensated for cognitive decline by reorganizing their brain network 12. Thus, it is of great importance to investigate whether aging influences brain white matter networks so we can determine methods to slow down these processes via lifestyle changes, such as physical exercise 8. Notably, it was observed that (i) one year of aerobic exercise intervention positively influenced white matter structure and cognition 13; (ii) a six-month dance intervention increased white matter volume in healthy older adults 14; (iii) individuals who performed life-long physical exercises preserved their white matter integrity 15; (iv) white matter microstructure mediated the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance (i.e., spatial memory) 16. This evidence suggests that physical training and a relatively high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (e.g., achieved through regular physical training) are beneficial to preserving white matter integrity and cognition. However, no evidence determined the type of physical exercise (e.g., aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, motor-cognitive exercise) that is the most beneficial to preserve white matter integrity and cognition. The current study examines if dual-task training, which includes physicalor motor activity in combination with cognitive demands, is more effective in improving cognitive functions than a single task 17.\nThe literature provides evidence suggesting that motor-cognitive exercise (e.g., Tai-Chi, dancing) could be the most beneficial type of physical exercise to preserve or improve neurocognition in older individuals because they combine motor (physical) and cognitive demands 18,19. Tai-Chi (TC) is a cognitive-motor exercise, which is commonly performed at mild-to-moderate exercise intensities 20,21. Its choreographed routine typically consists of graceful, slow, fluid movements and it is performed in coordination with deep breathing, relaxation, and mental focus 22,23. Such unique features have attracted people worldwide in pursuit of health and longevity, especially the frail elderly who experience functional decline 24,25. Early studies have extensively investigated the health benefits of TC, suggesting that it effectively improved physical (e.g., balance, lower-limb strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness) 26,27 and mental (e.g., stress, anxiety, pain, and depression) health outcomes of different age groups 28,29.\nScholars have also been interested in examining the neurocognitive benefits of TC 30. Notably, the majority of early studies mainly focused on the effects of TC on behavioral outcome measures related to cognition 31,32. With recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, scholars started to pay great attention to understanding the neurobiological mechanisms and processes underlying the cognitive protective effects of TC, suggesting that patients with brain damage demonstrate neuropsychological improvements after practicing TC 33. Despite the brain decline through age, previous studies have indicated that the regional homogeneity of brain functions and cognition were significantly different between TC practitioners and TC-naïve individuals. Specifically, TC was shown to improve brain functions among older adults 34. Furthermore, after a 12-week TC training, low frequency fluctuations of the brain increased in the dorsal prefrontal cortex in the TC group and higher prefrontal cortex activity was associated with better behavioral performance in the TC group 35,36. However, little research has examined the changes in brain white matter due to TC practice, and compared it to a different form of regular physical exercise, such as walking, which is considered to be most feasible and low cost among many physical exercises. Hence, the current study aimed to examine whether TC practice and walking practice changes brain white matter and the brain network.",

The estimation of dispersion tensor model and the fractional anisotropy (FA) of every voxel were calculated. Fiber assignment by a continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm was used to reconstruct the direction of white matter fiber bundles in the brain network. High FA values indicate tight connections between the microstructures. Conversely, the lower FA value usually indicates white matter damage. All traces were calculated based on voxel seed point and the traced streamlines were terminated when the fold angle of the fibers was greater than 45 degrees or the FA value was less than 0.2.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Previous experimental work has shown that TC can improve multiple forms of psychological well-being and influence the functional architecture of the brain in older adults 34,38. However, so far only a few studies have examined the effects of TC on the human brain and available studies have focused on changes in functional brain activation during standardized cognitive tests or structural brain changes in response to a long-term TC training 36,39. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate in a cross-sectional study the influence of long-term TC training on brain white matter and the brain network in comparison to walking training. Results of the current study indicate that TC can improve small-world attributes compared to walking (M  5.02  0.35 vs. 4.50  0.33, p  0.05, Cohens d  1.534). The significant effects were huge. Although the aggregation coefficient and local efficiency attributes expressed positive trends in favor of TC compared to walking, these results were not statistically significant (p  0.05).\nThe principal focus of the present paper was whether TC compared to walking could influence characteristics of brain white matter. Statistical evidence showed that TC could attenuate small-world attributes. Watts and Strogatz (1998), in their work have creatively and quantitatively described the small-world characteristics to define this kind of network with small, average short path and large clustering coefficients similar to the corresponding random network as in the small world network, which can be represented by two proportions 40. The network with small world characteristics has high local efficiency and global efficiency, and the network can transfer information effectively both locally and globally. The results showed that TC affected Sigma in the small-world parameter. Moreover, Sigma might be linked to better individual cognitive performance in the 2-back task. The N-back test is considered to be an important paradigm for measuring the updating function in working memory 41. Friedman et al. (2006) found that the updating function of working memory is most closely related to higher cognitive activities compared with other central executive functions. This finding aligns with similar results from several other studies on this general topic 42. Wei et al. (2014) evaluated the effects of TC on intrinsic human brain architecture in older adults 34. Age-matched older adults separated into two groups (TC versus healthy controls matched for sex, age, and education) completed a computerized flanker-type test measuring different behavioral aspects of attention. That is, participants had to rapidly and accurately respond to stimuli presented on a computer screen using either hand (left or right). The target stimulus was an arrow pointing in either direction (left or right) flanked by additional stimuli on each side. Furthermore, participants were instructed to press the left mouse button with their left thumb or the right mouse button with their right thumb as fast as possible when the target arrow pointed to the left or right, respectively. Significant decreases were detected by the fMRI in the left anterior cingulate cortices and the right superior frontal cortices of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices of the TC group compared to the controls. However, increases in the right post-central gyrases were observed in TC groups relative to the controls 34. In this experiment, TC expressed greater functional brain activity within the post-central gyrases which may indicate a benefit of TC training. Moreover, TC training produced a greater beneficial effect on executive and non-executive cognitive functions compared to brisk walking, and this finding may be related to the inherent demands of TC (e.g., higher cognitive demands of TC compared to walking) 43.\nDue to the mind-body component of TC, the combination of meditation with slow movements, deep rhythmic breathing, and relaxation has been shown to influence different regions of the human brain in a multitude of ways 44. For example, TC is believed to influence the slow frequency fluctuations in resting brain activity by generating numerous combinations of oscillatory waves. As a result, changes in brain activity (throughout different regions) can be observed and quantified. Therefore, we speculate that the differences between TC and walking may be due to the different exercised-induced characteristics placed upon the body. As previously mentioned, TC involves a calming mind-body component that differs from walking (excitatory), thus producing different mechanisms acting upon the human brain and its associated networks.\nIn support of the present findings, it appears that TC may attenuate neural network changes in the human brain, therefore influencing the age-associated cognitive decline in elderly populations. Neural networks with high clustering and short path lengths are the direct benefit of long-term TC training, thus making the transmission of global and local information more efficient from network to network. From a public health perspective, our findings suggest that a positive influence of TC on white matter brain network could be of great interest because evidence suggests that white matter brain changes occur in aging and in neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer disease, Multiple sclerosis) 45,46. For instance, alterations in brain white matter occurring in individuals suffering from Alzheimer disease and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show white matter changes prior to development of dementia 9. Hence, given our findings that long-term TC training positively influences white matter brain network and cognitive performance, it seems reasonable to speculate that physical interventions using TC training could be a promising strategy in dementia prevention. This idea is supported by the finding that engaging in long-term TC training significantly improved executive function performance in older adults with MCI 46,47. With regard to Multiple sclerosis (MS), evidence in the literature indicates that (1) brain white matter changes are associated with changes in cognitive performance in MS 48,49 and (2) TC interventions in MS improve both motor-cognitive abilities (e.g., balance) and quality of life 26,50. Whether such cognitive and motor-cognitive performance improvements after long-term TC training are caused by changes in brain white matter networks among other factors (e.g., upregulation of neurotrophic factors, grey matter changes) is a promising area for further investigations.\nOur findings should be interpreted in light of the limitations of the current study and in light of the work from other laboratories, as few research studies have examined the effects of TC on the brain white matter network. A limitation of the current study is the homogenous sample of elderly women which inhibits the generalization of our findings. Likewise, considering the small sample size, until data is replicated using a larger sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. Future research should consider investigating the effects of TC on elderly men to determine gender influences in the long-term TC effects on changes in brain network activity. A strength of our investigation, however, is the comprehensive assessment of functional brain activity utilizing rsfMRI to capture changes in human brain network activity in response to long-term TC training.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In conclusion, our findings have shown that long-term TC training is more conducive to optimize the brain structure and to promote the efficient brain function network of older women. Long-term TC training produced significant changes in white matter small-world attributes. Changes as such may indicate improvements in the efficiency and transmission of neural data between human brain networks. This long-term TC training would prove useful in elderly populations where cognitive decline is prevalent. In contrast, non-significant changes were also noted for the aggregation coefficient, global efficiency and local efficiency attributes in favor of the TC group. Collectively, these attributes are used to measure the efficiency of neural transmission between networks in the human brain. Furthermore, findings may suggest that rsfMRI can be an appropriate tool for measuring the effects of TC on the characteristics of brain white matter in the human brain. As such, findings from this study encourage further investigations to test whether long-term TC training could be a promising strategy to protect against cognitive decline and alterations of white matter brain networks, which both occur in aging and in neurological diseases such as Multiple sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers disease, and dementia.",

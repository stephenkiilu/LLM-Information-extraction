    "abstract": "Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported that both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) revealed microstructural changes fractional anisotropy (FA). However, these results were not conclusive. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the consistent FA alterations and the differences between MCI and AD. Case-control studies investigating MCI and AD using FA were searched in the online databases. The quantitative FA value of cognition-related brain regions was extracted and the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed or random effect models. Twenty six studies with a total of 1,021 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Significantly decreased FA in patients with AD were identified in the left frontal lobe, corpus callosum (CC), fornix, hippocampus (HP), cingulate gyrus (CG), cingulate bundle (CB), uncinate fasciculus (UF), superior longitudinal fasciculus(SLF), the inferior fronto-occipital fascicles (IFOF), and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus(ILF) relative to MCI in this meta-analysis. This study provides objective and quantitative evidence that AD is associated with FA alteration within left frontal lobe, CC, FX, HP, CG, CB, and UF may suggest the key regions of the process from MCI to AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "As a progressive neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type (60-80) of dementia in the elderly characterized by memory and cognition degradation 1,2. The World Alzheimer Report 2009 3 reported that 35.9 million people suffered dementia in 2010, and the number was expected to rise to 115.4 million by 2050. However, many clinical trials of pharmacologic treatment to improve cognitive outcome failed.\nFor instance, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, produced by Pfizer, Johnson  Johnson, and Eli Lilly, respectively, did not improve cognitive function in AD patients 4,5.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been generally recognized as the pre-clinical stage of AD, characteristized by subjective cognitive decline, objective memory deficit, and normal activities of daily living. The annual progression rates from MCI to AD is approximately 8.1. 6,7 Patrizia et al. 8 demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could improve language and memory function in subjects of MCI. Yoon et al. 9 deemed that cognition decline in MCI patients may be remitted by menopausal hormone therapy at perimenopause. Therefore, some studies have focused on improving the cognitive function in patients with MCI in the hope of delaying or even reversing the progression of MCI to AD.\nBecause MCI has become the more valid target of therapy than AD, early diagnosis of MCI and AD was important on preventing or delaying the progress of AD by the implementation of an intervention in time. The differential diagnosis of MCI and AD also attracted the attention of many researchers.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to investigate the microstructure and integrity of white matter in healthy and diseased brains by measuring the diffusion of water molecules through nerve fiber bundles from 1994 10, and this method became one of the most popular MRI techniques in the research of central nervous systems. Random translational motion of water molecules was measured by DTI to obtain the information of neuro-fiber structure assessing fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). FA imaging prevailed other imaging because it was the most distinct from observing the microstructure of white matter fiber. Accordingly, the FA value could signify the arrangement of neurocell structure and the integrity of white matter fibers. FA value ranged from 0 to 1, and with the value closer to 1, the more complete the white matter fiber.\nOne previous meta-analysis 11 reported obviously reduced FA value of white matter as well as impaired cognitive functions in MCI patients relative to healthy controls. However, the whole brain is constituted by many regions of the brain. Different brain regions presented different changing of FA value in the progression from MCI to AD. Mielk et al. 12 discovered that the FA value of hippocampus (HP) declined more in AD than MCI. Gong et al. 13 considered that FA value of hippocampus-cingulum-cingulate cortex pathway in Papez circuit represented the significance of progression from MCI to AD. Thomas et al. 14 demonstrated that FA value of the corpus callosum and body fornix in the AD group was reduced significantly, compared to the group of MCI. However, the findings from DTI studies have been less consistent than expected. It is necessary to make an objective analysis to overcome such inconsistency and characterize FA alterations from MCI to AD by quantitatively pooling these studies. Although, one previous meta-analysis 11 established two comparisons: AD vs. healthy control and MCI vs. control, no study on comparison of FA of MCI and AD has been conducted.\nThe purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the consistent FA changes from MCI to AD to explore the potential brain regions during the progression of MCI to AD, and provide some quantitative evidence of imaging for early diagnosis of AD.",

The reference lists of relevant studies were further reviewed to detect additional suitable articles.\nStudies were selected according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: (1) case-control studies containing the patients of MCI and AD; (2) patients enrolled in these studies met the international diagnostic criteria for AD and MCI; (3) the age of MCI and AD patients should range from 55 to 85 years; (4) quantitative FA value could be extracted or calculated from the data provided in the study and which could be expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD); (5) the study was an original article published in English; (6) the study enrolled vascular MCI or AD was excluded from the meta-analysis; and (7) studies involving subjects with other neurodegenerative disorders (not including MCI or AD) or other diseases concomitant with cognitive disorder and white matter changes such as stroke, cortical infarction and subdural hematoma were excluded from this meta-analysis.

Any disagreements regarding the quality and data extraction were resolved by discussion and, if needed, consulting a third reviewer (QWM). The FA value was regarded as an indicator to assess white matter microstructure. The mean and SD of the FA values of cognitive-related brain regions involving left, right, and bilateral side of the brain regions reported in each study were extracted as the outcome measures. When the standard error of the mean was provided in an article, it was transformed to standard deviation by formula of SD  SEM   n. The data syntheses were conducted between MCI and AD using Stata 14.0 statistical software (STATA Corporation, Texas, USA). Standardized mean deviation (SMD) with 95 confidence interval (CI) was calculated to assess the FA changes of the cognitive-related brain regions from MCI to AD. The heterogeneity analysis was evaluated with Cochrans Q test and I 2 index to assess the consistency between trials. The random effect model was applied when I 2  50 or significant heterogeneity was found by Q statistic. Otherwise, the fixed effect model was used. For significant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, or sensitivity analysis was further conducted. An Egger egression test was used to detect possible publication bias.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study demonstrates the quantitative FA differences between patients with MCI and AD. This metaanalysis identified significantly reduced FA value in patients with AD relative to MCI patients which mainly located in CC, HP, CG, CB, UF, SLF, IFOF, and ILF. The subgroup meta-analyses revealed that different sub-regions of the brain area also showed different alterations, especially in the left frontal, genu and splenium of CC, left and posterior cingulate gyrus, para-hippocampal cingulate bundle, right cingulate bundle, left UF, right UF, and right ILF. Similar to our results, previous research 17,18 considered that the FA value decreased with the cognitive impairment of patients, especially in MCI and AD patients. The consensus of previous studies is that the decline of FA value in different brain areas led to different cognitive dysfunction 192021.\nThe biggest white matter fiber was CC, which connects brain regions of frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, etc., reflecting the physio-pathological changing of early AD. CC could be divided into rostrum, genu, body, and splenium by anatomic site. Wang et al. 22 and Zimny et al. 23 deemed that the genu of CC was region specific to AD. While Fellgiebel et al. and Yamauchi et al. considered that the splenium of CC was a sensitive indicator to progress to AD. Based on these results, we included genu and splenium in subgroup analysis for CC. Based on our result of metaanalysis, genu and splenium of CC were both region specific to distinguish MCI and AD. In our research, most of the included AD subjects were at early and middle stages. MCI and early AD were two closely related pathological processes, indicating that obvious changing of FA value might both exist in MCI and preliminary AD. Hence, declined FA values in genu and splenium of CC were both reliable to identify MCI and mild to moderate AD.\nPapez circuit was a closed neural pathway in the limbic system, participating in emotion modulation and cognitive function. The whole Papez circuit included HP, FX, mammillary bodies, fasciculus thalamus, anterior thalamic nuclei, capsule internal, CG, cingulum bundle, para-hippocampal gyrus, and HP 24. As the main part of Papez circuit, the integrity of cingulum was associated with episodic memory, cognition, and emotional function. Cingulum gyrus was vital to the limbic system, dividing into anterior and posterior parts. The previous study 25 demonstrated that FA value of the left posterior CG (PCG) would reduce apparently in AD patients, compared with the healthy controls. In addition, through our meta-analysis, the microstructure of PCG in AD was changed compared to the MCI. Consistent with our finding, Qi et al. 26 considered that declined cerebral glucose metabolism was primarily observed in PCG for AD patients. Metabolic of PCG showed a positive correlation with memory and learning function hinting that PCG played a crucial role in memory and learning 27. In default mode network research, PCG was a vital node to connect with other brain areas 28. The reduction of FA value in PCG, therefore, could be a sensitivity biomarker to observe MCI and early AD. The functional connectivity of HP and PCG was reduced in MCI indicating that the integrity of the cingulum bundle was damaged 13. The CB was the important part of the limbic system connecting the HP and the cingulate cortex. With progressing to AD, axonal degeneration in cingulum bundle increased persistently, and secondary to affect demyelinate, it leads to the disruption of CB. We attempted to analyze the significant decline in the whole CB. Finally, we observed that the changing of FA value in the most of structures of CB would be a reference indicator for MCI turning to AD.\nThe FX input was through the cholinergic pathway to the HP and was projected from the HP to other brain areas 29. The reason for episodic memory dysfunction might be the damage of the HP mammillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei damaged through FX. Compared to the healthy controls, FA values of FX reduced significantly in the AD group, but were not significant in the aMCI group. Also, there was no statistical difference between AD and aMCI 303132 opposing to our result. However, MCI subjects in the other included studies 33,34 mixed with non-aMCI and aMCI so that this confounding factor caused the opposite consequence. The damaged white matter microstructure in aMCI might differ from non-aMCI 35. Hence, the difference between aMCI and non-aMCI in white matter microstructure would be worthy of exploring in the future. The pathological process of AD presented changes from anterior to posterior parts of the brain 36. This started in the entorhinal cortexentorhinal cortex transition zone to HB, then cingulate gyrus to lateral temporal, frontal, parietal lobe, and ended in the occipital lobe. From the perspective of brain anatomy, the hippocampus might show the changing of pathology in the very earliest stages of AD or MCI 37. It was generally supported that reduction of FA value in HP would be a diagnostic indicator to distinguish MCI and AD 38. Moreover, Palesi et al. 39 discovered that the difference between MCI and AD met in MD value which reflected the whole dispersion level and dispersion resistance of water molecules. The increase of MD value also showed that inflammation in white matter fiber of HP gets worse in progressing MCI to AD.\nWe found the FA value in UF decreased significantly between MCI and AD which was consistent with the previous study 40. While, Hiyoshi et al. 41 provided a different view that FA value in left UF was related with the progression of normal cognition to aMCI, and the right was an indicator for progressing aMCI to AD. We compared these studies about UF and discovered a difference in method of DTI data acquisition: Hiyoshi et al. 41 applied imaging post processing without distortion corrections. Accordingly, the difference in FA value might be from the way of imaging data acquisition. IFOF connected frontal, occipital, and temporal lobes. It was especially the only one fiber bundle to link occipital and frontal lobes 42. The damaged IFOF was associated with visual-spatial processing and memory function. Two studies observed significantly decreased FA value in IFOF both in AD and MCI patients relative to healthy control, which was not detected between AD and MCI 43,44. While, Zimny et al. 23 discovered the difference of FA value between MCI and AD which was consistent with our results. Our finding supported that IFOF provided a neocortical connection in late AD, but there was no change of brain microstructure in MCI subjects.\nSLF and ILF, which corresponded to frontal, temporal, and occipital white matter, were related to spatial attention and spatial working memory. The changing of white matter fiber tracts of SLF and ILF was crucial to reveal the disease progression. There were different views on the FA value of SLF and ILF. Some researchers 20,23 considered that FA value of SLF might be an indicator during the progression of MCI to AD, but other researchers 43,44 opposed it. From our analysis, the FA value of SLF was significantly different from MCI and AD, but it was not in the subgroup of right, left, and SLFII. Combined with the above viewpoint, we considered that part of SLF anatomical structure could be a biomarker to predict disease progression, and it needs to explore in future. In addition, a previous study 23 discovered that FA value of left ILF reduced obviously between MCI and AD which was opposite to our result. It might be caused by different imaging parameters, such as field strength, b value, and the number of directions.\nFor the sake of finding out why our brain lobe group of the heterogeneity was more than 50.0, the heterogeneity analysis was conducted for several groups of brain regions. Subgroup analysis between left and right frontal lobe was performed to test the heterogeneity of studies with result of frontal lobe. FA value in the subgroup of left frontal lobe was lower than right, while FA value in subgroup of temporal lobe found no difference. From the perspective of the pathology, the white matter fiber of right frontal lobe was later to be involved by AD pathology rather than by the left frontal lobe 26. This phenomenon might be caused by its dominant role in the left hemisphere, leading to more neuronal activity in the left frontal lobe during episodic memory and executive tasks than the right frontal lobe. The blood perfusion of the left frontal lobe was higher than right which may because the A-β protein deposited is heavier than right. Also, memory impairment was correlated with the left frontal lobe and the left HP 45. Accordingly, the decline of FA value in left frontal lobe would become a sensitive biochemical indicator in progressing MCI to AD.\nFrom this meta-analysis, we also found the asymmetry in FA value between left and right hemispheres. A more delineated FA value was observed in the left frontal lobe and left CG, revealing the left side-dominant phenomenon 40. This phenomenon had already been proved in a previous DTI study: the FA value declined significantly in left cingulate fasciculus and left SLF 23,46. There was still a lack of reliable explanation to the side-dominant phenomenon though.",

      "text": "Although this meta-analysis is as much as objective, there still exist some limitations. First of all, more brain areas were included in the study than we analyzed because of lacked sample size leading to ignoring possible specific brain areas. Second, both aMCI and non-aMCI patients were enrolled in the MCI group together, but there may be some difference between their FA values in some brain regions. At last, we could only analyze the specific brain regions to distinguish the MCI and AD because of the insufficient data. However, the clear boundaries of FA value distinguishing AD and MCI could not be determined, which is of utmost important in the further studies.",

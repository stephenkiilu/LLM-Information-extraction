    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate structural connectivity and the relationship between axonal microstructure and clinical, cognitive, and motor functions in premanifest (pre-HD) and symptomatic (symp-HD) Huntingtons disease. Method: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from 35 pre-HD, 36 symp-HD, and 35 controls. Structural connectivity was mapped between 40 brain regions of interest using tractography. Between-group differences in structural connectivity were identified using network based statistics. Radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared in the white matter tracts from aberrant networks. RD values in aberrant tracts were correlated with clinical severity, and cognitive and motor performance. Results: A network connecting putamen with prefrontal and motor cortex demonstrated significantly reduced tractography streamlines in pre-HD. Symp-HD individuals showed reduced streamlines in a network connecting prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices with both caudate and putamen. The symp-HD group, compared to controls and pre-HD, showed both increased RD and decreased FA in the fronto-parietal and caudate-paracentral tracts and increased RD in the putamen-prefrontal and putamen-motor tracts. The pre-HD close , compared to controls, showed increased RD in the putamen-prefrontal and fronto-parietal tracts. In the pre-HD group, significant negative correlations were observed between SDMT and Stroop performance and RD in the bilateral putamen-prefrontal tract. In the symp-HD group, RD in the fronto-parietal tract was significantly positively correlated with UHDRS motor scores and significantly negatively correlated with performance on SDMT and Stroop tasks. Conclusions: We have provided evidence of aberrant connectivity and microstructural integrity in white matter networks in HD. Microstructural changes in the cortico-striatal fibers were associated with cognitive and motor performance in pre-HD, suggesting that changes in axonal integrity provide an early marker for clinically relevant impairment in HD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Neuropathological processes in Huntingtons disease (HD) primarily target medium spiny neurons of the striatum (Graveland et al., 1985). Neurodegeneration is also seen in pyramidal projection neurons in the motor and prefrontal cortices, and cingulate and angular gyri (Macdonald and Halliday, 2002;Thu et al., 2010). Together, these neurodegenerative changes are considered to be the cause of onset of clinical symptoms in HD (Thu et al., 2010). In contrast, the mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, which often appear several years before clinical diagnosis, remain largely unknown.\nDisruption of structural connectivity in specific neural circuits has been proposed to be one of the possible mechanisms leading to early cognitive and motor changes in premanifest Huntingtons disease (pre-HD) (Li and Conforti, 2013). Structural connectivity can deteriorate in HD due to axonal dysfunction and degeneration associated with huntingtin aggregates which can appear early in HD (reviewed by Li and Conforti, 2013). Hence, white matter atrophy is evident in T1-weighted neuroimaging studies of HD (Tabrizi et al., 2009;Thieben et al., 2002), with posterior-frontal whitematter degeneration apparent even in individuals far from onset (Tabrizi et al., 2009). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies of HD have also suggested selective microstructural changes in white matter encompassing cortico-striatal motor circuit, corpus callosum, periventricular region, corona radiata, and prefrontal cortex (Bohanna et al., 2011;Dumas et al., 2012;Rosas et al., 2006Rosas et al., , 2010;;Weaver et al., 2009).\nDTI also enables investigation of axonal fibers between gray matter structures using tractography methods (Bohanna et al., 2011;Jones, 2008). DTI tractography has been used in HD to isolate structural connections in specific neuroanatomical circuits including the motor loop and fronto-striatal circuit (Bohanna et al., 2011;Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008), providing evidence for circuit specific alterations in white matter microstructure in HD. For example, microstructural damage in the striatal nodes of the motor loop has been shown to be associated with motor dysfunction in HD (Bohanna et al., 2011). Structural connectivity changes of the fronto-caudal tracts have been shown not only to reflect years to onset, but also to be associated with oculomotor function in pre-HD (Kloppel et al., 2008). Moreover, reduced fiber connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the caudate has been shown to reflect symptomatology in pre-HD (Kloppel et al., 2008). DTI-tractography has also been used to determine pairwise connections between gray matter structures in the brain enabling calculation of a structural connectivity matrix for individual subjects (Zalesky et al., 2010). Network-based statistical methods can be used to isolate network connections that are altered in disease from the connectivity matrix (Zalesky et al., 2010(Zalesky et al., , 2011)). The identification of structural networks in pre-HD and symp-HD may provide insight into early markers of disease progression in HD.\nThe aims of the current study were to identify cortico-striatal networks affected in pre-HD and symp-HD, determine the microstructural alterations in the axonal fibers connecting these pathways, and investigate the relationship between axonal microstructural changes and clinical, cognitive and motor functions in pre-HD and symp-HD. We hypothesized that structural connectivity in neural circuits connecting motor and prefrontal cortices with the caudate and putamen would be affected in both pre-HD and symp-HD. Microstructural white matter degeneration in symp-HD has been reported in the body of the corpus callosum, which structurally connects frontal and parietal areas (Rosas et al., 2010). We hypothesized that symp-HD individuals would show further white matter structural disconnectivity in the fronto-parietal network. Fronto-striatal neural circuits are crucial for cognitive control (Liston et al., 2006). We hypothesized that the microstructural integrity of the fronto-striatal tracts would be associated with cognitive dysfunction in both pre-HD and symp-HD. To test these hypotheses, tractography was used to identify the extent of axonal connectivity between 40 neocortico and striatal brain regions. A network-based statistical method (Zalesky et al., 2010) was used to isolate neuroanatomical networks that showed connectivity differences between the groups. DTI-based measures of radial diffusivity (RD) are thought to be sensitive to demyelinative processes (Song et al., 2005). We measured RD values from the tracts identified as aberrant in pre-HD and symp-HD, and investigated the relationship of RD changes with clinical severity, and cognitive and motor performance.",

      "text": "Thirty-five pre-HD, 36 symp-HD, and 35 healthy control volunteers were included in this investigation, all recruited as part of the Australian-based IMAGE-HD study (Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013, in press;Gray et al., 2013). Recruitment procedures and inclusion criteria have been published previously (Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013). Controls were matched to pre-HD participants for age, gender and IQ National Adult Reading Test 2nd edition, NART-2 (Nelson et al., 1992), an estimate of premorbid intelligence. One-way ANOVAs revealed no significant differences in age or IQ scores between the pre-HD group and controls, but significant differences in age between controls and symp-HD, and between pre-HD and symp-HD, respectively (p b 0.05). CAG repeat lengths in the expanded alleles of the participants ranged from 39 to 50 (42  2 for pre-HD; 43  2 for symp-HD). Similar to Tabrizi et al. (2009), inclusion in the pre-HD group was based on UHDRS total motor score  5. The average years to clinical onset for the pre-HD group was 15  8 years, as determined by a formula based on age, and the number of CAG repeats (Langbehn et al., 2004). The average disease burden score (DBS; Penney et al., 1997) was 270  53. Years since the diagnosis of symptom onset (ascertained by the clinician A.C.) in the symp-HD group ranged from 0 to 5 years with a mean DBS of 379  70 for the group. Demographics, clinical information, and neurocognitive measures of interest are provided in Table 1. The complete battery of neurocognitive data collected for all participants as part of the IMAGE-HD study has been described in previous publications (Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013, in press;Gray et al., 2013).\nThe IMAGE-HD study was approved by the Monash University and Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committees. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "Network Based Statistics (NBS) (Zalesky et al., 2010) was used to non-parametrically compare the group connectivity matrices (Zalesky et al., 2010). NBS has been validated and previously used to map aberrant structural networks in psychiatric and neurological conditions (Bai et al., 2012;Zalesky et al., 2011). A general linear model was used to model group differences with age differences covaried as microstructural changes have been reported in fronto-parietal white matter tracts (Davis et al., 2009). Permutation based unpaired t-tests using 5000 permutations were used to identify networks which differed between pre-HD and controls and symp-HD and controls. NBS identified anatomical networks which show significant differences in structural connectivity between groups (t N 2.6) using a networklevel family-wise-error correction method (p b 0.05).\nFor networks that showed differences for the cortico-striatal brain region pairs between pre-HD and controls, the fiber tracts were visualized using trackvis software. Group-level masks of the cortico-striatal tracts of interest were generated by averaging the tracts from all participants (pre-HD, symp-HD and controls). For each subject, RD and FA values were calculated for the tracts of interest using group-level masks as a measure of microstructural integrity of axonal fiber tracts.\nFor comparison of tract-specific RD between groups, we further divided the pre-HD group into two sub-groups: pre-HD far from onset (pre-HD far ) and pre-HD close to onset (pre-HD close ). This subgrouping was achieved using a median split of the pre-HD group according to their years to onset. Estimated years to onset for pre-HD far (n  17) was 21  6 years and for pre-HD close (n  18) was 10  3 years. Independent t-tests were conducted to compare RD and FA values of specific tracts between pre-HD far and pre-HD close , pre-HD far and controls, pre-HD close and controls, overall pre-HD group and controls, and symp-HD and controls. Significant differences corrected for family-wise error rate using Holm-Bonferroni method (p b 0.05) are reported.\nTo investigate the relationship between microstructural changes and clinical severity and cognitive and motor performance, partial correlation analyses (with age as a covariate) were performed using average RD in the tracts of interest. We selected SDMT (symbol digit modalities test), Stroop Word, and speeded tapping tasks from our neurocognitive battery as they have been shown to be sensitive to clinically relevant impairment in HD (Hart et al., 2011;Rowe et al., 2010;Tabrizi et al., 2009). SDMT measures visual attention and information processing speed and Stroop measures cognitive control, allowing us to tap into aspects of executive functions dependent on the integrity of fronto-striatal circuits (Liston et al., 2006). Speeded tapping performance (i.e., inter-tapping interval) provided a measure of motor function, which is dependent on integrity of motor loop. For the symp-HD participants, UHDRS motor scores were used as a measure of clinical severity and were correlated with RD values from the tracts disrupted in symp-HD. Significant correlations corrected for family-wise error rate using Holm-Bonferroni method (p b 0.05) are reported.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study investigated white matter connectivity between frontal, parietal, and striatal brain regions in Huntingtons disease using DTI fiber deterministic tractography and network based statistical analysis. A neuroanatomical network connecting putamen with prefrontal and motor cortices showed reduced white matter connectivity and microstructural changes in pre-HD compared with healthy controls. Symp-HD showed impairment in a network connecting frontal and parietal cortices, and striatum. RD in white matter tracts reflected clinical severity in symp-HD, and cognitive and motor functions in both pre-HD and symp-HD. Our findings support the hypothesis that HD is associated with aberrant changes in specific neuroanatomical circuits, which reflects clinical status and cognitive function.\nNeuroimaging studies have consistently reported gray and white matter degeneration in cortical and sub-cortical structures many years prior to expected diagnosis, and in the absence of overt motor signs of HD (Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008;Tabrizi et al., 2009). In the current study, impaired structural connectivity in premanifest HD was localized in a neuroanatomical circuit connecting three regionally distinct nodes: putamen, orbitoprefrontal, and precentral cortices. Fewer streamlines in pre-HD between the nodes which are involved in motor and cognitive functions (Liston et al., 2006), indicate early changes in both motor and cognitive parts of cortico-striatal neural circuit in pre-HD. The putamen, prefrontal, and motor cortices have been implicated in several voxel-wise investigations of both gray matter and white matter in pre-HD (Delmaire et al., 2013;Rosas et al., 2006;Tabrizi et al., 2009). Furthermore, segregated microstructural alterations in white matters of cingulum, longitudinal fasciculi, corona radiata, internal capsule, and cerebral peduncles have been previously reported in pre-HD (Stoffers et al., 2010). Consistent with previous studies, we also found increase in RD, suggesting greater demyelination, in the pre-HD close to onset in the tract connecting putamen with prefrontal cortex.\nThe integrity of the putamen-prefrontal tract is critical for efficient recruitment of cognitive control during executive function (Liston et al., 2006). In the pre-HD group, a significant relationship was observed between increase in RD in the prefrontal-putamen tract and poorer performance on SDMT and Stroop tasks. Although a previous study has reported association between motor function and integrity of white matter in the sensorimotor cortex in pre-HD (Dumas et al., 2012), we provide fresh evidence for relationship between cognitive function and integrity of a putamen-prefrontal tract in HD. The finding further supports that cognitive function in pre-HD may be associated with damage to specific cortico-striatal neural circuits (Kloppel et al., 2008;Tabrizi et al., 2009).\nIn the symp-HD group, the aberrant network comprised of corticocortical tracts connecting the frontal and parietal cortices via corpus callosum, and the cortico-striatal tracts connecting the left caudate with posterior parietal, and the putamen with the primary motor and prefrontal cortices. The more wide-spread structural network disruption in symp-HD is consistent with previous studies reporting abnormal white matter morphology and diffusion properties in HD (Rosas et al., 2006(Rosas et al., , 2010;;Tabrizi et al., 2009). Structural connectivity of motor circuits and its microstructure have been shown previously to be particularly vulnerable in symp-HD, reflecting both motor function and clinical severity (Bohanna et al., 2011). Here, we also found increased RD and decreased FA in cortico-cortical tracts in symp-HD. Aberrant RD was associated with clinical severity (UHDRS) and tests of cognitive function (SDMT and Stroop). Previous studies have also reported aberrant microstructure in cortico-striatal circuits associated with symptomatology in symp-HD (Bohanna et al., 2011;Kloppel et al., 2008). However, Rosas et al. (2010) recently provided evidence for increased RD and decreased FA in all parts of the corpus callosum and suggested that this may drive the reduced cortico-cortical connectivity in symp-HD. Our findings indicate that structural connectivity of the cortico-cortical network is not only disrupted in symp-HD but is also associated with clinical signs in motor and cognitive functions.\nNetwork based analysis of structural connectivity has been used previously in several case-control studies (Zalesky et al., 2011), and is particularly suitable for detecting subtle changes in neuroanatomical circuits (Zalesky et al., 2010). In HD, early changes during disease progression have been localized in smaller white and gray matter areas (Rosas et al., 2006(Rosas et al., , 2010;;Tabrizi et al., 2009). However, previous reports of damage in white matter in HD did not model pair-wise connectivity disturbances between multiple cortico-striatal brain areas. The use of a network approach in the current study enabled us to isolate a network of cortico-striatal regions as a key macro-circuit affected early in Huntingtons disease.\nA number of cellular and neuroimaging studies, when interpreted together, may help to explain the structural connectivity and microstructure deficits in HD. Although cortico-striatal atrophy is a hallmark feature of HD (Douaud et al., 2006;Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Tabrizi et al., 2009), neuropathological studies have provided evidence for striato-cortical axonal degeneration, characterized by disruption of organelle and myelin sheath fragmentation in HD mouse models even when neuronal loss is largely absent (Yu et al., 2003). During all stages of HD, dendritic trees of surviving medium spiny neurons show abnormal growth, divergent changes in spine density, and recurving of dendritic branches (Ferrante et al., 1991;Vonsattel et al., 1985). There is also evidence to suggest aberrant enkephalin immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra in the absence of cell loss (Waters et al., 1988), and reduced density of enkephalin immunoreactive fibers in the external globus pallidus in pre-HD Fig. 3. Tract-specific microstructral differences in specific tracts from the network showing group differences. In the putamen-motor tract, the symp-HD showed significantly greater RD compared with the control and pre-HD groups. In the putamen-prefrontal tract both the pre-HD close to onset (pre-HD close ) and symp-HD showed significantly greater RD compared with controls, symp-HD showed greater RD compared to the pre-HD group, and pre-HD close showed greater RD compared to controls In the fronto-parietal tract both the pre-HD close to onset (pre-HD close ) and symp-HD showed significant increase in RD and reduced FA compared with controls, and the symp-HD group showed significantly increased RD and decreased FA compared to the pre-HD group. In the caudate-paracentral tract the symp-HD showed significantly greater RD and reduced FA compared with the controls and pre-HD groups. In the inset above the bar diagram for each tract, group-level masks for each tract (blue), connecting the regions (red and green), are visualized in an example 3D brain.  b 0.05,  b 0.001. Vertical bars represent standard error. (Albin et al., 1990). The striatum, which shows very early dysfunction of axonal fibers, is both functionally (Di Martino et al., 2008) and structurally (Wiesendanger et al., 2004) connected to the fronto-parietal cortex. RD increases with the degree of demyelination in WM tracts (Song et al., 2005). Our finding, of increased RD in specific cortico-striatal tracts in pre-HD, when taken together with cellular and new imaging findings, indicates very early network-wide axonal dysfunction in HD.\nIn considering limitations of the current study, it is important to note that tractography was used to create the connectivity matrix between brain regions of interest. Accuracy of the connectivity matrix is dependent on reliability of the fiber tracking method used. While a methodology similar to that used in the current study has been used in several other tractography studies (Bai et al., 2012;Zalesky et al., 2011), some fiber tracts may have been missed due to problems with fitting the diffusion tensor model in the regions of complex fiber geometry (e.g., crossing fibers) and partial volume effects. Crossing fiber model (Tournier et al., 2008) has been developed to better characterize fiber tracts between brain regions, which was not used in the current study. Furthermore, the controls were matched for age with only the pre-HD group, raising the possibility that findings in symp-HD are due to effects of aging. However, the difference between symp-HD and the controls remained significant when age was included as nuisance regressor, arguing against effect of aging on structural connectivity changes in symp-HD.\nIn conclusion, our findings provide evidence for network-specific decline in structural connectivity and microstructural integrity of white matter tracts in both pre-HD and symp-HD. Aberrant structural connectivity in pre-HD possibly represents early axonal dysfunction which is also related to subtle deficits cognitive and motor functions. Proliferation of disruption in structural connectivity may subsequently lead to the more advanced clinical severity profile observed in symp-HD. Our findings suggest that DTI-based tractography has the potential to serve as a sensitive method for the assessment of cerebral integrity to future treatments.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http:dx. doi.org10.1016j.nbd.2014.01.013.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive lethal neurodegenerative disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It is characterized by movement dysfunction (chorea, dystonia, bradykinesia, and rigidity) 1996;Hogarth et al., 2005 and progressive cognitive and psychiatric manifestations (depression, psychosis, apathy, and irritability) Folstein, 1991;Huntington, 1872. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on choromosome 4 that encodes for polyglutamine in the huntingtin protein Macdonald et al., 1993. The number of CAG repeats is associated with the accumulation of the huntingtin protein within the brain cells, which eventually leads to cell death. Over a threshold of 36 CAG repeats, longer expansion is correlated with earlier disease onset Kieburtz et al., 1994. To estimate the degree of cumulative exposure to the effects of the CAG repeat expansion, an index based on the length of CAG repeats and the life-time exposure to the disease burdenthe CAG-age product, or CAP score Penney et al., 1997;Ross et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2011-appears to be a useful predictor of the clinical status of HD patients Penney et al., 1997.\nThe course of HD can be divided into premanifest and manifest stages Ross et al., 2014. Premanifest individuals are those patients who have a positive genetic test for CAG expansion in Huntingtin, but who are clinically not distinguishable from controls (presymptomatic period), or those who experience subtle motor, cognitive, and behavioral changes but are not yet sufficient for a diagnosis of manifest HD (prodromal period). Manifest HD is defined as the unequivocal presence of an otherwise unexplained movement disorder in a subject at risk for HD. It is believed that interventions and treatments for HD could be most effective during the premanifest period, because once individuals enter the manifest stage, the disease progresses inexorably and is irreversible and fatal. Therefore, a number of recent clinical and research studies have focused on premanifest HD or earlymanifest HD Crawford et al., 2013;Henley et al., 2009;Novak et al., 2014;Paulsen et al., 2014b;Tabrizi et al., 2013, searching for sensitive markers to investigate the disease biology before the onset of clinical symptoms.\nThe hallmark of neuropathology in HD is selective neurodegeneration in the striatum, which shows the earliest and most striking pathological changes, followed by the globus pallidus Vonsattel et al., 1985. Myelin breakdown and increased iron concentration have been identified in the white matter tracts Bartzokis et al., 2007;de la Monte et al., 1988;Zecca et al., 2004, and neuronal loss has been found in the cerebral cortex Hedreen et al., 1991;Jackson et al., 1995;Sieradzan and Mann, 2001. Besides the histopathological findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an increasingly important diagnostic tool for both clinical and research purposes, and offers the opportunity for large longitudinal and cross-sectional studies.\nStructural MRI, such as T1-and T2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) Basser et al., 1994, has shown to be robust markers for HD Georgiou-Karistianis et al., 2013;Paulsen et al., 2014b;Tabrizi et al., 2009. Brain volumetric measurements from T1-weighted (T1w) images provide a macroscopic profile to evaluate structural atrophy. For example, striatal atrophy was the most profound signature of HD, which may begin to manifest as far as 9-20 years before the onset of motor deficits Aylward et al., 2004;Rosas et al., 2001;Sanchez-Castaneda et al., 2013. Decreased white matter volume has been demonstrated in prodromal HD individuals more than 15 years before diagnosis Paulsen et al., 2010. Compared to volumetric changes, DTI offers more microscopic information about the tissue microstructural organization and white matter integrity Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996. DTI studies have revealed specific white matter changes, for example, in the corpus callosum in premanifest Faria et al., 2016;Kloppel et al., 2008;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2006;Stoffers et al., 2010 and manifest HD Bohanna et al., 2011b;Della Nave et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2010;Sritharan et al., 2010. Reduction in fractional anisotropy and elevation in mean diffusivity were consistently reported, which may be related to the disruption of white matter integrity and the increase of tissue water content.\nThe accumulated knowledge from previous MRI studies offered a tremendous base of information about the structural changes in premanifest and manifest HD. Recent advances in image acquisition and image analysis techniques have enabled large longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, such as TRACT-HD Tabrizi et al., 2009Tabrizi et al., , 2012Tabrizi et al., , 2013  and PREDICT-HD Paulsen et al., 2006aPaulsen et al., , 2008Paulsen et al., , 2014b, and have opened opportunities for advanced analysis of disease progression patterns. Recently, Harrington et al. 2016 demonstrated that basal ganglia volume and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) revealed early changes in premanifest HD patients in PREDICT-HD cohort. Dominguez et al. 2013 reported greater longitudinal changes in the symptomatic HD patients than premanifest HD patients in terms of whole brain, gray matter, and striatum volumes, and caudate FA. Shaffer et al. 2017 identified baseline differences and longitudinal changes in the corticostriate tracts of PREDICT-HD patients.\nIn this study, we are interested in whole-brain analysis of the onset points of structural MRI changes. We adopted a novel multivariate linear statistical model, namely, the change-point analysis Younes et al., 2014a, to detect the initiation (in terms of CAP score) of structural MRI changes (volume and DTI) based on the premanifest PREDICT-HD data. The analysis was performed on over 50 brain structures after multi-atlas Tang et al., 2013;Wu et al., 2015based, whole-brain segmentation, and then these results were integrated to map the whole brain topology of the change points. In this way, the change-point analysis can bring unique information about the spatial pattern and order of the brain structural changes, which may offer additional information about the disease progression and can be potentially important for the design of therapeutic interventions at the optimal time and locations.",

Participants were recruited from 33 sites across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, and had annual study visits that consisted of a neurological motor examination, cognitive assessment, brain MRI, and psychiatric and functional assessments, with blood samples for genetic and biochemical analyses. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before participating in this study. Premanifest HD subjects were recruited by elective predictive genetic testing that showed CAG repeats !36 and standardized exclusion criteria Paulsen et al., 2008. Age-matched controls who were negative for the CAG expansion (CAG repeats 30) were enrolled as comparison subjects. There were no subjects with CAG between 30 and 36. The CAP score in this study was defined as CAP 5 (age at entry) 3 (CAG 2 L), where L 5 33.66 Zhang et al., 2011. The premanifest HD patients used in this study had CAP scores that ranged from140 to 586.\nWe used T1-weighted images from 297 subjects in this study, including 85 controls and 212 premanifest HD. For DTI, we collected data from 257 subjects (a subset of the T1 population), among which 79 were controls and 178 were premanifest HD. Basic demographic information of these subjects is summarized in Table I. The mean age of the control group was smaller than that of the premanifest-HD group (43 6 11 vs 46 6 10, P  0.05, twotailed Students t test).

      "text": "The T1-weighted images were segmented using our online resource MriCloud Djamanakova et al., 2014;Mori et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2015Wu et al., , 2016  (www.mricloud.org), through a fully automated T1 image segmentation pipeline. We employed a multi-atlas fusion procedure for the segmentation, in which multiple brain atlases were transformed to the target image and the warped atlas labels were combined with label fusion algorithms. A number of studies have demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy with multi-atlas fusion as opposed to single atlas approaches Artaechevarria et al., 2009;Langerak et al., 2010;Lotjonen et al., 2010;Warfield et al., 2004. Specifically in our pipeline, the target images are first aligned to the standard MNI space Collins et al., 1994 and corrected for intensity inhomogeneity Tustison et al., 2010. A set of 45 adult brain atlases (age 49.3 6 20 years old) were transformed to the MNI space target image, using iterative large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) Beg et al., 2005;Dupuis et al., 1998, and the warped atlas labels were combined with a joint label fusion algorithm Wang et al., 2013 to obtain the final segmentation. The whole brain was segmented into 289 structures, which could be grouped at five levels of granularity based on their ontological relationships Djamanakova et al., 2014. In this study, we chose a median level of granularity where the whole brain was segmented into 54 structures, because this granularity level matches the radiologists reading relatively well Faria et al., 2015, and the segmentation reproducibility is high Djamanakova et al., 2014. Structural volumes were obtained based on the T1 segmentation at this level. The brain parcellation maps at the different granularities are illustrated in Supporting Information, Figure 1A.\nThe DTI data were first processed with DTIPrep Oguz et al., 2014 for motion correction, eddy current correction, 343.5 6 68.9 2 (50)1 (25)1 (25) Site_032 5 1 (20)4 (80) 40.9 6 14.1 0 (0)5 (100) 260.0 6 48.9 0 (0)2 (40)3 (60) Site_096 3 0 (0)3 (100) 34.3 6 3.6 1 (33)2 (67) 297.9 6 0.1 0 (0)2 (100)0 (0) Site_001 2 2 (100)0 (0) 49.5 6 0.6 0 (0)2 (100) 514.9 6 38.9 2 (100)0 (0)0 (0)\nand automated quality control Magnotta et al., 2012. The diffusion-weighted images were co-registered to the b0 image of the second repetition, with a 12-parameter affine transformation Woods et al., 1998. Tensor calculation was performed in DtiStudio Jiang et al., 2006 (www.mristudio. org), where the six elements of the diffusion tensor were obtained for calculating the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean diffusivity (MD) Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996.\nThe FA and MD images were segmented by coregistration with the JHU DTI brain template (JHU-MNI-SS) Oishi et al., 2008, using 12-degree affine transformation followed by dual-channel LDDMM based on FA and MD contrasts Ceritoglu et al., 2009. JHU-MNI-SS provides multicontrast DTI atlases with 189 structures, and these structures were grouped to 39 structures at a granularity level similar to that of the T1 atlas (Supporting Information, Fig. 1B). The FA and MD values were extracted from the 39 regions of interest (ROIs) with an FA threshold of 0.2, except for the basal ganglia and thalamus. With the FA threshold, mainly white matter tracts in the ROIs were used in the analysis.\nWe excluded two T1-weighted images due to noticeable image transformation errors; and three DTI images due to imaging artifacts that gave problematic FA or MD calculations, for example, the FA values were over two times of the average.",

      "text": "We established multivariate linear statistical models to examine MRI measurements in relation to the CAP score, as an indicator of disease progression. In the change-point model, only the premanifest HD subjects were involved, as the CAP score was defined only for these subjects. The multivariate model regressed the response variable y (volumes or DTI metrics), on the CAP score (c), age (a), sex (s), and intracranial volume (i).\nwhere k is the subject index The DTI protocols are grouped into three types. r Change Point Analysis in Premanifest HD r r 5039 r H(x) 5 1 if x  0 and H(x) 5 0 otherwise. Therefore, the model in Eq. ( 1) describes a linear dependence of MRI measurement (y) on the CAP score, which takes effect only when CAP is greater than the change point D. We assume that the MRI measures are constant with respect to CAP before the change points, after correcting for age (therefore, taking normal aging into account), sex, and intracranial volume.\nThe model parameters a; b; g; d; u; l were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) Miller et al., 2015;Younes et al., 2014a, at each D with log-likelihood L(D). Briefly, the log-likelihood of the linear model is computed based on the sum square of the residuals, which is then optimized with respect to the model parameters through an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure Dempster et al., 1977. The optimal change point is obtained at D when the likelihood L(D) is maximal among all L(D), with the Ds between 200 and 500 at a step size of 1.0. The null hypothesis is b50, and a significant change point is found when b 6 ¼ 0 at D.\nFor the DTI data analysis, the intracranial volume was not included in the model, but the DTI protocol was included as an additional covariate, which showed significant effects in a number of structures (Supporting Information, Methods and Results).\nwhere d k is the categorical variable that represents the type of DTI protocols (Table III) for subject k, and all other parameters have the same meaning as Eq. (1).\nTo make the analysis comparable between the different MRI markers and different structures, we used the percentage change of the volume, FA, and MD measurements with respect to the mean of the controls, y5 y2y control ð Þ h i y control ð Þ, rather than the absolute value. The two quantities (y and y) are linearly scalable to each other, and thus, did not affect the change-point analysis.",

Figure 1 shows the regions in each group with significant differences from the controls, and the color map indicates the percentage of volumetric difference with respect to the controls. In the low-CAP group, a few structures, including the basal ganglia, the left inferior white matter, and the right brainstem, showed a significant volume reduction (4, 3, and 3, respectively), while the thalamus showed a slight expansion (0.5). In the median-CAP group, the volume reduction in the basal ganglia ranged up to 10; the bilateral corpus callosum, inferior white matter, and brainstem showed a 5, 3, and 4 volume reduction; and several sulci regions showed significant expansion (2-10). In the high-CAP group, the basal ganglia showed the largest extent of atrophy (20) while the lateral ventricle showed the largest expansion (42). The anterior and inferior white matter had a 4.5 and 3.2 volume reduction; the brain stem had a 5-7 volume reduction; and the sulci regions had a 3-20 expansion, with the smallest expansion in the frontal sulci and the largest expansion in the occipital sulci.\nFigure 2 plots the volumetric changes along with CAP score in several structures that showed significant change points, including the basal ganglia, the deep white matter structures, the brainstem structures, and the lateral ventricle.

Similar to earlier studies Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2006, the group analysis showed that MD increased and FA decreased in the premanifest HD subjects compared to the controls. Figure 4A demonstrates that the MD values in major white matter tracts, including corpus callosum, and the inferior, posterior, and limbic white matter, steadily increased from median to high CAP groups, among which the corpus callosum showed the greatest extent of change compared to the controls (3 increase in median-CAP and 9 in high-CAP). The basal ganglia showed a drastic MD increase from 5 in the median-CAP group to 20-23 in the high-CAP group. MD in the thalamus also showed a rapid increase from 2 in the median-CAP group to 10 increase in the high-CAP group. The white matter tracts in the occipital lobe showed an MD increase from 1.6 in the median-CAP group to 4 in the high-CAP group; while tracts in the parietal, limbic, and temporal lobes showed a significant MD increase in the high-CAP group (4, 3.5, and 3, respectively). No significant changes were detected in low-CAP group compared to controls.\nThe dynamic changes in MD with CAP score are shown in Figure 5, where the data are plotted in the same way as in Figure 2: the blue dots are the MD measurement after correcting for age and sex; the black curves are the fitted MD data from the change-point term; the red lines point to the change-point positions; the x-axis is the CAP score; and the y-axis is the percentage difference in MD with respect to the controls.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, we achieved whole-brain mapping of the critical change points of structural MRI measurements in premanifest HD, which revealed important information about the order and pattern of brain structural changes before the clinical onset. We found that (1) brain atrophy occurred in a central-to-peripheral manner, starting from the deep gray matter, and then spreading to the deep white matter; (2) the volumetric reduction generally exhibited a posterior-to-anterior gradient, with the posterior white matter changes ahead of the anterior white matter;\n(3) the MD measurements showed early increases in the basal ganglia and the occipital lobe, and relatively late but rapid increases in the corpus callosum and thalamus after the initiation points; and (4) FA did not show significant changes in premanifest-HD cohort, except for the corpus callosum and basal ganglia in high-CAP patients.\nOur results support previous studies Aylward et al., 1997;Bohanna et al., 2011b;Della Nave et al., 2010;Faria et al., 2016;Paulsen et al., 2006b,;Peinemann et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2001Rosas et al., , 2010;;Sanchez-Castaneda et al., 2013;Sritharan et al., 2010, and they also bring unique new information about the disease characteristics in time and space. For example, the basal ganglia showed the earliest and most striking atrophy in our analysis, which is known to have high correlation with motor dysfunction seen in HD Aylward et al., 2004Aylward et al., , 2012;;Guo et al., 2012;Paulsen et al., 2010;Peinemann et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2001. Substantial white matter volume loss before clinical onset has also been reported in a number of studies Novak et al., 2014;Paulsen et al., 2006b,;Stoffers et al., 2010, especially in the corpus callosum and posterior white matter tracts Crawford et al., 2013;Rosas et al., 2010;Tabrizi et al., 2009. Cortical atrophy was found close to clinical onset Douaud et al., 2009;Rosas et al., 2003, and the cortical thinning occurred in a posterior-to-anterior fashion Rosas et al., 2008. These earlier findings are generally consistent with our observations, which together, point to a central-toperipheral and posterior-to-anterior atrophy pattern. It is also noticed that the thalamus showed a small degree of volume increase in the low-CAP group (0.05 and 0.5 in the left and right thalamus). We suspect that the younger age of the low-CAP group (35.7 6 9.6 years) compared to the controls (46.2 6 11.3 years) may lead to larger thalamus volume in this group, which effect was overturned by the disease progression in the median and high CAP groups. The age disparity may also be one of the reasons that a slight asymmetry was observed between hemispheres in the low-CAP group, as the asymmetrical aging effect Raz et al., 2004 can be mixed with early HD effect in the low-CAP group.\nPrevious DTI studies have demonstrated white matter deficits in the corpus callosum Crawford et al., 2013, internal capsule Rosas et al., 2006, corticospinal tract Phillips et al., 2015, cortico-striatal circuit Novak et al., 2014, and across extensively distributed white matter fibers Novak et al., 2014;Reading et al., 2005, years before symptoms occur. In addition to the existing findings, our data provide a more comprehensive spatial and temporal view of the changing pattern. An early MD increase was observed in the white matter within the basal ganglia, and that result is in-line with our previous findings in striatal fiber tracts using tractography analysis Faria et al., 2016. The large extent of MD increase in the corpus callosum and the significant changes in the deep white matter tracts also agrees with previous studies from our group and others Crawford et al., 2013;Faria et al., 2016;Rosas et al., 2006, and the change point results indicated that this white matter degeneration occurred relatively early compared to volume loss, in terms of their CAP scores. The thalamus demonstrated a relatively late, but rapid, MD increase after the change point, which may be associated with the thalamic dysfunction attributable to network degeneration Eidelberg and Surmeier, 2011;Kassubek et al., 2005;Ruocco et al., 2007. Furthermore, the white matter tracts in the occipital lobe demonstrated an early occurrence of MD increase, which may correlate to the cortical thinning Johnson et al., 2015;Rosas et al., 2008 and white matter abnormality Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Reading et al., 2005 in the occipital lobe. FA measurements did not show detectable changes except for the corpus callosum and basal ganglia in high-CAP premanifest-HD. The finding of increased FA in the basal ganglia has been reported in earlier studies in both human Bohanna et al., 2011a;Douaud et al., 2009;Kloppel et al., 2008;Magnotta et al., 2009;Rosas et al., 2006 and animal HD models Antonsen et al., 2013. However, the biological basis of this change is not certain. FA is a nonspecific measurement that reflects a range of microstructural information, including the axonal density, myelination, and the orientations of the fiber tracts. The interpretation of FA in gray matter structures such as the basal ganglia and thalamus is even more complicated. We speculate that increase of FA could be related to the loss of secondary fibers that alters the fiber composition, which may be tested using high angular diffusion MRI techniques Tuch, 2004;Wedeen et al., 2008 that resolve the crossing fibers.\nThe spatial pattern and temporal course of the structural MRI changes revealed by change-point analysis could have important indications on our understanding of disease progression in HD. Increasing evidence suggests that mutant Htt can spread in a prion-like manner from one neuron to another, perhaps via vesicle-like structures. Pathology could also spread via excitotoxicity or loss of trophic factor support or other mechanisms Jucker and Walker, 2011;Ross et al., 2014. Our data do not reveal the mechanism, but do support the concept of the spread of pathology through the brain. Therapeutic strategies for HD are being developed using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and other RNAibased reagents in order to suppress mutant Htt message and protein Kole et al., 2012;Kordasiewicz et al., 2012;Ross and Tabrizi, 2011. However, as these reagents do not cross the blood-brain barrier, they must be applied within the CNS. Antisense oligonucleotides delivered intrathecally are already in phase I trials (http:huntingtonsdiseasenews.comtagionis-httrx). ASOs could also be delivered into the lateral ventricles or into the striatum, although this is not currently planned. Viral delivery of shRNA or other RNAi reagents is under development, likely for intraventricular or direct intrastriatal delivery Passini et al., 2003;Wang et al., 2005. Our data suggest that targeting the striatum and surrounding white matter early in the disease process could be advantageous.\nThis study employed multivariate statistical models to detect the change points, which were recently developed in our group for the study of Alzheimers disease in several selected structures Liang et al., 2015;Younes et al., 2014a. This study combined multi-atlas-based whole-brain segmentation and the change-point analysis in premanifest HD patients. We analyzed the structural MRI changes with respect to the CAP score, which describes the extent of exposure to the CAG repeat expansion in HTT and can be used to index disease progression. Compared to the conventional groupwise analysis, which inevitably homogenizes individual differences within the groups, the change-point analysis utilizes individual measurements (longitudinal andor cross-sectional) into a linear model and statistically detects the critical point when structural changes begin. This provides a more precise description of brain structural changes in the continuum of disease progression compared to group analysis.\nHowever, we also realize that there are several limitations to our study. (1) The use of multicenter study data from a large number of performance sites (23 sites in our study) with variable acquisition protocols may have introduced bias in the analysis. We investigated the effects of performance site and DTI scan protocol using covariate analysis (Supporting Information). Our analysis suggested that the effect of performance site was not significant in the change point model nor the group analysis model, whereas the DTI protocol played a non-ignorable role in both models (Supporting Information, Results). Therefore, we included the DTI protocol as a covariate for change point and group difference analysis to account for its effect on MD and FA data. (2) Our T1 multiatlas segmentation pipeline has been shown to be robust to the scanner difference and acquisition protocols Liang et al., 2015, and it demonstrates high segmentation accuracy in the subcortical structures Tang et al., 2013. However, the accuracy of cortical segmentation is difficult to evaluate, as the cortical boundaries are difficult to distinguish even with manual delineation. That is one of the reasons we analyzed volumes at a relatively low granularity (lobular scale), which is relatively insensitive to segmentation errors Djamanakova et al., 2014. (3) Volume-based structural MRI analysis may not be as sensitive as shape analysis Miller et al., 2013Miller et al., , 2014;;Van Camp et al., 2012;Younes et al., 2014b or cortical thickness analysis Rosas et al., 2008. The change point model is a generic approach that can be applied to various measurements, including the shape and cortical thickness, which may worth investigation. In addition, we may also apply the analysis to finer structures, such as subregions of the caudate, which might lead to the intracaudate change-point topology. (4) Our data from the PREDICT-HD study are cross-sectional, which may infer but not directly reflect longitudinal structural degeneration, and thus, the interpretation needs to be cautious. The use of cross-sectional data is necessary for this type of statistical analysis, which requires a large number of data points and is impossible with only longitudinal studies, and important knowledge has been generated using large population cross-sectional imaging data in this and many other studies Dominguez et al., 2013;Paulsen et al., 2014b;Tabrizi et al., 2013.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "We employed a novel change-point analysis model to extract the onset points of structural MRI changes in premanifest HD subjects. Change points from whole-brain volumetric analysis demonstrated that brain atrophy occurs in a central-to-peripheral and posterior-to-anterior manner. The DTI-based analysis revealed an MD increase in the basal ganglia, the occipital lobe, and the major white matter tracts with relatively early change-points. Granted the limitations of analyses of cross-sectional data, the pattern and order of the structural MRI changes potentially offer new perspectives for understanding of the disease progression in premanifest phase, and potentially for the timing and location of therapeutic interventions.",

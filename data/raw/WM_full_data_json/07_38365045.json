    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor and cognitive abilities. Multiple studies have found white matter anomalies in HD-affected humans and animal models of HD. The identification of sensitive white-matter-based biomarkers in HD animal models will be important in understanding disease mechanisms and testing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Here we investigated the progression of white matter deficits in the knock-in zQ175DN heterozygous (HET) mouse model of HD at 3, 6 and 11 months of age (M), reflecting different states of phenotypic progression. We compared findings from traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced fixel-based analysis (FBA) diffusion metrics for their sensitivity in detecting white matter anomalies in the striatum, motor cortex, and segments of the corpus callosum. FBA metrics revealed progressive and widespread reductions of fiber cross-section and fiber density in myelinated bundles of HET mice. The corpus callosum genu was the most affected structure in HET mice at 6 and 11 M based on the DTI and FBA metrics, while the striatum showed the earliest progressive differences starting at 3 M based on the FBA metrics. Overall, FBA metrics detected earlier and more prominent alterations in myelinated fiber bundles compared to the DTI metrics. Luxol fast blue staining showed no loss in myelin density, indicating that diffusion anomalies could not be explained by myelin reduction but diffusion anomalies in HET mice were accompanied by increased levels of neurofilament light chain protein at 11 M. Altogether, our findings reveal progressive alterations in myelinated fiber bundles that can be measured using diffusion MRI, representing a candidate noninvasive imaging biomarker to study phenotype progression and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in zQ175DN mice. Moreover, our study exposed higher sensitivity of FBA than DTI metrics, suggesting a potential benefit of adopting these advanced metrics in other contexts, including biomarker development in humans.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive genetic neurological disease that affects the motor and cognitive abilities of people with HD (PwHD) (Bates et al., 2015;Snowden, 2017). HD is caused by an expansion in the CAG trinucleotide repeat of the huntingtin gene (HTT), leading to the expression of toxic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) (MacDonald et al., 1993). The medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum are most vulnerable to the toxic properties of mHTT, causing atrophy of the striatum and leading to motor dysfunction, a hallmark clinical sign of the disease (Fazl and Fleisher, 2018;Vonsattel et al., 1985;Wild et al., 2010).\nCurrently, there are no disease-modifying treatments available (Estevez-Fraga et al., 2020;Ferguson et al., 2022). To assess the efficacy of the current therapeutic strategies, animal models play a crucial role, and biomarkers are needed to identify specific anomalies or their mitigation post-intervention. The successful utilization of animal models depends on (1) model phenotypes that resemble the human phenotype that are (2) governed by analogous underlying pathologic mechanisms, and (3) the availability of markers that can measure the progression and modification of disease.\nThe zQ175DN heterozygous (HET) mouse model is a genetically precise knock-in mouse model of the CAG expansion responsible for HD, in which exon 1 of human HTT (containing 190 trinucleotide CAG repeats) was knocked into the endogenous murine Htt gene. zQ175DN mice are a subtle modification of the original zQ175 mouse model (Heikkinen et al., 2012;Menalled et al., 2012), in which the retained 5 neomycin cassette from the original line was removed (Farshim and Bates, 2018). They show progressive striatal projection neuron (medium spiny neuron) abnormalities and striatal volume loss (Deng et al., 2021;Goodliffe et al., 2019), complex alterations in basal ganglia indirect pathway activity (Atherton et al., 2016;Callahan et al., 2022), widespread HTT aggregate pathology (Herrmann et al., 2021;Smith et al., 2014), and extensive striatal transcriptional and proteomic dysregulation that is similar to the one that PwHD exhibit (Langfelder et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2020). Behaviorally, zQ175  zQ175DN mice exhibit progressive circadian dysfunction (Smarr et al., 2019) and other subtle behavioral manifestations indicative of cortico-basal ganglia circuit impairments, including amotivationapathy (Covey et al., 2016;Oakeshott et al., 2012), cognitive impairment (Piiponniemi et al., 2018), gait abnormalities and hypo-locomotor phenotypes (Beaumont et al., 2016;Heikkinen et al., 2020a;Smith et al., 2014). Unlike PwHD -but in common with other HD mouse models -striatal atrophy appears largely due to cell shrinkage and neuropil loss, rather than overt cellular neurodegeneration, suggestive that HD mouse models likely model an early stage of HD pathology throughout their lifespan (Deng et al., 2021).\nSince zQ175DN is already well studied for its phenotypic and neuropathologic similarity with the human disease, our study focuses on the third point, that is, the identification of biomarkers.\nIn PwHD, white matter shows prominent anomalies, and there is evidence that some of these anomalies may precede the typical striatal volume loss (Byrne et al., 2018;Casella et al., 2020). The measurement of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein, a known indicator of axonal damage, indicates that axonal damage occurs very early, before volumetric atrophy emerges (Byrne et al., 2018). Moreover, NfL levels are a good predictor of future atrophy (Johnson et al., 2018).\nWe therefore aimed to investigate longitudinally the zQ175DN mouse model utilizing state-of-the-art MRI techniques and analytical tools to determine whether we could detect microstructural anomalies in myelinated fiber bundles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely applied in HD studies before (Casella et al., 2020;Estevez-Fraga et al., 2021), but the conventional diffusion tensor model is limited in its ability to disentangle meaningful information from derived metrics in the presence of crossing-fibers (Jeurissen, Tournier, et al., 2014). Techniques such as constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) have been developed to address the issue of crossing-fibers by separating the diffusion-weighted signal into fiber bundles (Jeurissen et al., 2014b;Tournier et al., 2004Tournier et al., , 2007)), and CSD has been demonstrated to improve the correlation between pathology and microstructure in crossing tracts (Reijmer et al., 2012). The fixel-based analysis (FBA) method uses CSD to extract different fiber orientations and generate multiple fiber elements (fixels) that contain detailed information on the macrostructure (fiber cross-section (FC)) and microstructure (fiber density (FD), intraaxonal volume) of fiber tracts, and a combined fiber density and crosssection (FDC) metric (Raffelt et al., 2017b). Recently, FBA has been used to identify fiber bundles (systems) that are altered in PwHD before (Zeun et al., 2022) and after (Adanyeguh et al., 2021;Oh et al., 2021) clinical motor diagnosis. These studies reveal that in PwHD, FBA metrics are reduced in the cortico-spinal tract (Adanyeguh et al., 2021;Oh et al., 2021;Zeun et al., 2022), and are correlated to clinical outcome measures (Adanyeguh et al., 2021;Zeun et al., 2022). Also, in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia, and Multiple Sclerosis, decreases in FBA metrics are often reported (see review Dhollander et al., 2021a). However, while FBA has been used in clinical studies, to date there are no studies that have used FBA to investigate animal models of HD.\nOur study had three objectives: to (1) investigate the brain fiber microstructural anomalies in zQ175DN compared to wildtype (WT) littermates, (2) characterize the temporal changes to identify potential biomarkers of disease progression, and (3) determine whether FBA has greater sensitivity compared to the DTI approach. Additionally, we have performed analysis of plasma NfL and myelin density using Luxol Fast Blue (LFB). We predicted that zQ175DN mice may develop structural anomalies with age and that regional changes would precede global microstructural alterations at later ages. We also predict that improved modeling of the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data may detect those anomalies with more sensitivity than the traditional DTI.",

Hence, 20 mice were scanned at 3, 6 and 11 months of age. Seven WT and 8 HET animals were only scanned at 3 and 6 months, as 9 WT and 9 HET mice were already scanned at 11 months of age (Supplementary Fig. 1). Mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Maine, USA). Due to sporadic congenital portosystemic shunt occurring in C57Bl6J mice (Cudalbu et al., 2013), all animals were screened at Jackson Laboratories before shipment to avoid this confounding factor; hence, all animals used in this study were shunt-free. Mice were genotyped at birth and after experiments to determine their number of CAG repeats (WT  77 CAG repeats, HET  7194  3 CAG repeats).\nAll animals were single-housed at the central housing facility of the University of Antwerp on a 12-h light-dark cycle in climate-controlled rooms. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental procedures and animal handling described in this investigation were carried out according to European guidelines for the housing and use of laboratory animals (201063EEC). This project was approved by the ethical committee on animal care and use at the University of Antwerp, Belgium (ECD 2017-09 and2020-33).",

After induction, the mice were placed in a dedicated stereotactic setup that restricts movement. The animals breathing rate and body temperature were continuously monitored throughout the scanning procedure (SA Instruments, INC., USA). The breathing rate was maintained between 90 and 120 breaths per minute by adjusting the concentration of isoflurane and the body temperature was maintained at (37.0  0.1)  C using a heated feedback control system (SA instruments, INC., USA).\nDiffusion-weighted images were acquired on a 7 T Pharmascan 70 16 horizontal MR system (Bruker, Germany) interfaced with Paravision 6 software (Bruker, Germany).

      "text": "The gradient table of all diffusion datasets was checked and corrected in MRtrix3 (Jeurissen et al., 2014a). The complete dMRI image series was denoised in MRtrix3 (Veraart et al., 2016a(Veraart et al., , 2016b) ) and then corrected for Gibbs ringing artifacts in MRtrix3 (Kellner et al., 2016). The next step was a combined distortion, motion, and eddy current correction which includes an automated outlier slice detection algorithm using FSL6.0 software tools (Andersson et al., 2003;Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016;Skare and Bammer, 2009;Smith et al., 2004).\nFor FBA, pre-processed diffusion datasets were bias field corrected (N4 algorithm, ANTs) (Tustison et al., 2010). Then, group-averaged tissue response functions were estimated from dMRI data for the main tissue types; gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using an algorithm in MRtrix3 (Dhollander et al., 2016;Dhollander et al., 2019;Dhollander et al., 2021a;Jeurissen et al., 2014b). Diffusion-weighted images were up-sampled (MRtrix3) to an isotropic voxel size of 200 μm 3 . Then, the fiber orientation distributions (FOD) were estimated using a multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm (MSMT-CSD) (Jeurissen et al., 2014b;Tournier et al., 2004), resulting in tissue density maps for each compartment (white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), which were intensity normalized between tissue types (Dhollander et al., 2021b;Raffelt et al., 2017a).\nThe white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid tissue density maps of five HET and five WT subjects were randomly selected per age to create unbiased multi-tissue (white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) templates using a combined non-linear (SyN) registration in ANTs. All white matter fiber orientation distributions (WMFOD) maps were warped to the WMFOD template and converted to an MRtrix3 compatible format.\nThe WMFOD template was thresholded to include FOD lobes with an amplitude higher than 0.1 to include only white matter containing voxels. In the next step, the fixels were indexed in these white matter voxels and the apparent fiber density images were assigned to each fixel (Raffelt et al., 2012). Individual WMFOD images were warped to the WMFOD study space without reorientation of the fixels. Then individual fixel maps were reoriented using the warps that were estimated during the spatial transformation step from individual WMFOD to template WMFOD space. The correspondence between the subject and the template fixels was determined and the FD value of a subject fixel was assigned to its corresponding fixel in the template space. The FC was estimated from the warp field that maps from the template to the subject space (i.e., a reverse mapping). Finally, the combined metric fiber density and fiber cross-section parametric fixel maps were created per subject by multiplying the FD and FC fixel maps.\nA probabilistic 20 million streamline tractogram was generated in template space based on the WMFOD template using the iFOD2 algorithm (minmax tract length  125 mm, maximal angular deviation per step size is 45  , and streamline termination for an FOD amplitude of 0.1) and filtered with the SIFT algorithm to two million streamlines in MRtrix3 (Smith et al., 2013). This tractogram was used to perform smoothing and connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE) (Raffelt et al., 2015) of fixel data (FD, FC, and FDC). This tractogram was further reduced to 200.000 randomly selected tracts for visualization.\nFor diffusion tensor analysis, the dataset was smoothed separately within each tissue type, i.e., the white and gray matter, to reduce information spillover, using a 400 μm full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel in AFNI. Diffusion data were fitted to the diffusion kurtosis model in the subject space using Mrtrix3 (Basser et al., 1994;Veraart et al., 2013). Diffusion tensor metrics were calculated; fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD), and these parametric maps were warped to the template space for further analysis. Region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-of-interest (TOI) analysis were performed in whole brain white matter, corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), caudate putamen, and motor cortex, which have been often included as ROIs in human HD studies (Estevez-Fraga et al., 2021).",

Blood samples were collected from all mice at 6 and 11 months of age via acute puncture of the submandibular vein. Mice were restrained to taut the skin over the mandible. An acute puncture of the submandibular vein was performed using a 5.5 mm lancet (Goldenrod, MEDIpoint). Blood was then collected in pre-chilled 250 μL K-EDTA coated microtubes (BD microtainer MAP, NJ, USA). Approximately 200 μL of whole blood was collected, to ensure that 50 μL of plasma could be collected and kept on ice. Blood samples were centrifuged within 15 min of collection at 4  C with 5000 rpm for 5 min. Plasma was transferred to new labeled Eppendorf tubes chilled on dry ice and stored at -80  C. Samples were shipped on dry ice and NfL concentration was analyzed at Charles Rivers Laboratories.\nPlasma NfL levels were assessed using a factory validated-and Charles River Laboratories-qualified Simoa NF-Light Advantage Kit (product 103186, Quanterix, MA, USA). Plasma samples were first diluted with the kits NF-Light Sample Diluent (kit part 102252) at a 120 dilution factor and then analyzed with a fully automated Quan-terix HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix, MA, USA). To process and analyze samples, the HD-X Analyzer instrument used a multi-array of femtoliter-sized reaction chambers that isolated and detected single NfL molecules bound to proprietary paramagnetic beads supplied with the assay kit (part 102246). Anti-NfL antibody-coated beads were incubated with NfL protein standards (Kit part 102255), quality controls (including high, mid and low quality controls and an endogenous matrix quality control), or diluted plasma samples. Each well containing beads was then incubated with a biotinylated anti-NfL detection antibody supplied with the kit (part 102248). Unbound antibody was removed by a series of washes with system wash buffers (product 101619 and 100205.2, respectively, Quanterix, MA, USA) and antibody-bound beads were then loaded into arrays of femtoliter-sized wells that held no more than one bead per well. β-galactosidase-labeled streptavidin (kit part 102250) was added, followed by addition of resorufin β-Dgalactopyranoside substrate (kit part 103159). Wells were subsequently sealed with system sealing oil (product 100206, Quanterix, MA, USA) and the fluorescence signal digitally imaged by the Quan-terix HD-X Analyzer. A calibration curve was obtained by plotting the average number of enzymes per bead (AEB) signal against reference NfL protein concentrations. A five-parameter logistic (5PL) model was then used to fit the sigmoid calibration curve with a weighting factor of 1Y2. The concentration (pgmL) of NfL protein in plasma samples was determined by interpolation from the calibration curve.",

FD was higher in the cortical fibers and lower in fibers of the cerebellum of HET mice compared to WT littermates. On the contrary, FC was lower in HET mice compared to WT in widespread fiber bundles, including fibers in white matter structures such as the corpus callosum genu (CCG), internal capsule (IC), external capsule (EC), fimbria of the hippocampus (FH) and the arbor vitae of the cerebellum (AVCb) as well as gray matter structures such as the motor cortex (MC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), caudate putamen (CPu), and substantia nigra.

Contrary to the clear FBA-based outcomes, FA nor any other DTI-based metric were able to detect significant genotypic effects in the caudate putamen (Supplementary Tables 1 2).\nFibers in the motor cortex showed a decreased FDC as indicated by a significant main effect of genotype (F (1,73)  13.06, p  0.0017, Fig. 4C). FC was decreased at 6 months of age in HET mice (-9.38, p  0.0001, Supplementary Table 2). No difference was observed in the FD metric.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We have used traditional and advanced diffusion metrics in the zQ175DN HD mouse model at 3, 6, and 11 months of age to investigate microstructural anomalies in myelinated fiber bundles, its temporal progression, and the sensitivity of advanced FBA modeling as a potential marker for neuropathological anomalies in this HD mouse model. We demonstrated the presence of structural differences in myelinated fibers in the zQ175DN HET mouse brain at 6 months of age, with a further progression at 11 months of age. Regional anomalies in dMRI data were detected before global dMRI anomalies were found. FBA metrics could detect earlier and more prominent alterations in myelinated fiber bundles compared to the DTI metrics, supporting its use as potential marker for the investigation of HD-like phenotypic alterations in the zQ175DN mouse model.\nLoss of white matter is considered a key feature of disease progression in PwHD, and global alterations in white matter features have been reported after clinical motor diagnosis, including white matter volume decrease and global MD increases (Estevez-Fraga et al., 2023;Gregory et al., 2020;Tabrizi et al., 2011).\nOur study used a measure of the whole myelinated fiber compartment to assess if such a global pattern could reveal statistically significant differences. When analyzing the myelinated fibers in the white matter compartment, using the FBA metrics, we were able to measure a statistically significant global decrease at both 6 and 11 months of age, in contrast to the DTI-based metric (FA) showing a difference only at 11 months of age.\nWe show that, in the zQ175DN mouse model, the most affected region is the genu of the corpus callosum, a finding in line with recent work in the Q140 HD mouse model (Pérot et al., 2022), as well as an earlier report demonstrating an anterior to posterior sensitivity of the corpus callosum in the R61 transgene HD model (Gatto et al., 2021). In PwHD, some studies report that the anterior part of the corpus callosum is most affected (Klöppel et al., 2008), while other studies suggest that the corpus callosum body (medial) is earliest affected (Rosas et al., 2006) and show a decrease in FA and increase in RD (Phillips et al., 2016). Taken together, these findings support the utility of diffusionweighted imaging in the corpus callosum and suggest its potential as a biomarker of disease monitoring and HD-modifying treatments.\nIt is reported that changes in myelin density result in altered water diffusivity, as detected by dMRI (Casella et al., 2020;Song et al., 2002), thus an LFB staining was performed to rule out whether changes in myelin occurred in the corpus callosum genu. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, the myelin content of the corpus callosum genu did not Another important factor contributing to the alterations in water diffusivity is the size and shape of axons which is maintained by the cytoskeleton. Neurofilament is a crucial constituent of the cytoskeleton and regulates axon caliber and mechanical support of the cytoskeleton (Yuan et al., 2017). When neurofilament loss occurs in axons, their structural integrity could become compromised (Nihei and Kowall, 1992;Vickers et al., 2016). Increased axonal tortuosity leads to a less coherent directional preference of water diffusivity and therefore to reduced FA values (Nilsson et al., 2012). This has been demonstrated in the rapidly progressing HD mouse model R62, where tortuosity is markedly increased in callosal fibers (Gatto et al., 2019). This interpretation was supported by the increased plasma NfL protein levels observed at 11 months of age in HET mice. Neurofilament light chains are structural elements of axons, known to be increased in cerebrospinal fluid (Constantinescu et al., 2009;Wild et al., 2015) and plasma (Byrne et al., 2017) in PwHD, and therefore proposed as prognostic biomarkers in HD (Rodrigues et al., 2021;Scahill et al., 2020). Increased levels of NfL have also been observed in rodent models of HD such as the R62 model, which were also correlated with disease severity (Soylu-Kucharz et al., 2017).\nNfL protein levels are significantly increased at 11 months of age in zQ175DN HET mice, but not at 6 months of age, indicating that structural deficits can be detected using dMRI, prior to plasma NfL elevation in the zQ175DN mouse model. A possible explanation is that the detection of axonal damage using a peripheral marker (plasma NfL) is slower than a more local readout of axonal integrity using dMRI.\nTogether with the finding that no difference was observed using LFB to quantify myelination in the corpus callosum genu, we conclude that the observed differences are mainly driven by axonal pathology itself rather than demyelination. This is contrary to many findings in other human HD studies and studies in rodent model mimicking the HD phenotype, mainly reporting white matter related anomalies which result in subsequent axonal damage (Casella et al., 2020). Further ultrastructural investigation, e.g. electron microscopy, could elucidate the precise morphological changes that occur in myelinated fiber bundles in the zQ175DN model.\nThe caudate putamen is considered a hallmark region in HD and consists of a complex structure containing predominantly D1 and D2 medium spiny projection neurons and traversing myelinated fiber bundles that connect the basal ganglia circuit to the cortex, thalamus, and many more structures (Fazl and Fleisher, 2018). The fixels that were modeled in our study in the caudate putamen, connect the motor cortex to the basal ganglia. These are known connections of the cortico-striatal pathway which have been demonstrated using diffusion MRI tractography and tracer studies (Allen atlas) (Pérot et al., 2022). Alterations to the cortico-striatal projections inhibit their ability to relay information and potentially lead to the motor pathology of HD in zQ175DN, which is first observed at approximately 6 months of age (Wu et al., 2022). However, progressive reductions in FC in the caudate putamen start at 3 months, suggesting it is appearing in parallel to local accumulation of mHTT aggregates and loss of phosphodiesterase 10A (Bertoglio et al., 2022a), preceding the known macrostructural changes (Heikkinen et al., 2012). The appearance of widespread changes at 6 months of age was anticipated given that most molecular, cellular, behavioral, cognitive, and brain functional changes appear at this age (Farrar et al., 2014;Heikkinen et al., 2020b;Ibrahim et al., 2023;Vasilkovska et al., 2023;Zarate et al., 2023), also reflected in the body weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 3) (Wu et al., 2022). Our findings also reveal a progressive pathology, which is in line with the progressive nature of HD (Bertoglio et al., 2018;Bertoglio et al., 2022b;Häggkvist et al., 2017), leading to mHTT aggregation in intracellular and intranuclear inclusions (Bertoglio et al., 2022a;Southwell et al., 2016). The earliest progressive change was observed in the fiber-cross section metric at 3 months of age in the caudate putamen. This could therefore be explored and potentially proposed as an early biomarker of HD.\nGlobal decreases in FDC at 6 months also precede the decrease in FA observed at 11 months of age using the more commonly used DTI, further supporting that FBA could be an earlier, more sensitive marker. Similarly, regional observations in fibers of the corpus callosum and myelinated fibers of the caudate putamen show that the FDC metric is more sensitive to detect genotypic differences compared to FA.\nHowever, FBA requires a high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) acquisition, i.e. high b-values (2000 smm 2 ) and sufficient diffusion directions to improve the estimation of fiber density and resolve crossing fibers (Raffelt et al., 2017b), and therefore requires longer scan times. It provides improved sensitivity compared to DTI thanks to the multiple diffusion shells incorporating more information to model crossing fibers with a minimal threshold of FD. Despite the longer diffusion acquisition, the approach can easily be translated to clinical studies and a similar acquisition has already been used in clinical studies of PwHD to perform FBA (Adanyeguh et al., 2021;Oh et al., 2021;Zeun et al., 2022). Adanyeguh et al. found that fixel-based metrics (FD, FC and FDC) are reduced, which was further supported by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) showing intra-axonal damage, decreased FA and increased RD in white matter tracts (Adanyeguh et al., 2021). In all studies using FBA to study HD, decreased fixel-based metrics in the cortico-striatalspinal tracts are observed in the HD population before and after clinical motor diagnosis (Adanyeguh et al., 2021;Oh et al., 2021;Zeun et al., 2022). Our work demonstrating the ability of FBA to detect white matter abnormalities in the zQ175DN mouse model, strengthens the interest in exploring FBA-based endpoints as response biomarkers in preclinical and clinical HD studies.\nHowever, the choice of FBA parameter is an important consideration, as we have observed that some parameters (e.g. FDC in the corpus callosum splenium) show a non-monotonic temporal change. Similarly, we previously reported a non-monotonic decrease in resting state brain functional connectivity, which is lower at 6 months of age, but not present at 10 months of age (Vasilkovska et al., 2023). Liu et al. observed a flip in directionality of differences in cerebral blood volume in zQ175 mice from 3 to 9 months of age, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms occurring at 3 months of age (Liu et al., 2021). It is important to mention that while FBA is a sensitive method, which does not require a priori assumptions for modeling of dMRI data, this method does not offer a direct biological interpretation of underlying pathological processes, such as those driving the observed non-monotonic changes in the corpus callosum splenium. Future studies investigating therapeutic effects on FBA markers in the zQ175DN are encouraged to include sufficient timepoints to investigate such non-monotonic changes.\nA limitation of this study is the use of only male mice. In rodent models, sex differences have been reported with more pronounced striatal deficits in male HD rats (Bode et al., 2008) and male Q175 HD mice (Padovan-Neto et al., 2019). Future studies including both male and female zQ175DN HET mice, in combination with the above described post-mortem readouts of tissue ultrastructure or localized readouts of NfL are encouraged.",

      "text": "By using FBA in the zQ175DN mouse model, we have shown the presence of micro-and macrostructural deficits in white matter fibers that occur in brain regions that are typically affected by mHTT-driven pathology. Progressive myelinated fiber alterations can be detected in the corpus callosum genu and caudate putamen prior to behavioral impairments using FBA metrics but not DTI metrics. The spatiotemporal progressive alterations in myelinated fiber bundles can be measured noninvasively using diffusion MRI. Altogether, further exploration of FBA-based endpoints as response biomarkers in preclinical and HD clinical studies is encouraged. The higher sensitivity of FBA to detect white matter anomalies than DTI metrics, suggests a potential benefit of adopting these advanced metrics in biomarker development in humans.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:doi. org10.1016j.nbd.2024.106438.",

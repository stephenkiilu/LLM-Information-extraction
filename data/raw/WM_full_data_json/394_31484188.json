    "abstract": "Introduction: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common familial cerebral small vessel disease caused by notch homolog protein 3 gene mutations and is strongly associated with ischemic stroke and dementia. Patients are characterized by cognitive impairment and widespread white matter (WM) lesions. However, the relationship between WM lesions and cognitive impairment is not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate WM microstructural abnormalities by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the relationship between WM alterations and cognitive impairment in patients with CADASIL. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated WM degeneration in 18 patients with CADASIL and 18 controls by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) based on DTI. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with CADASIL showed extensive and significant reductions in FA and increased RD, AD, and MD. These alterations were distributed throughout the entire brain (mainly the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, corona radiata, thalamic radiation, and cingulum). Furthermore, these WM microstructural alterations were significantly correlated with cognitive scores and stroke scale scores. Conclusion: Patients with CADASIL showed widespread WM abnormalities, and WM microstructural integrity and cognitive impairment were significantly correlated. Our results indicated that damage to WM tracts plays an important role in cognitive impairment in CADASIL.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common inherited small vessel disease of the brain and is linked to neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3 (Notch3) mutations 1. CADASIL is characterized by migraine, stroke, psychiatric disorders, and progressive cognitive impairment in adults 2. The most common symptoms of CADASIL are small ischemic strokes andor transient ischemic attacks and cognitive impairment, which appear in middle age and may progress to vascular dementia 3. One of the main characteristics of CADASIL is the presence of diffuse white matter (WM) lesions, which are often termed leukoaraiosis and are easily detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This finding suggests that various neural tracts in the human brain might be vulnerable to CADA-SIL. The mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in CADASIL is uncertain, but this effect may be secondary to WM tract damage.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique based on the measurement of water diffusion that is used to determine the orientation and diffusion characteristics of WM. DTI has been used to detect microstructural changes in CADASIL 456789. Chabriat et al. 4 observed a 60 increase in water mean diffusivity (MD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in hyperintensities identified on T2-weighted images; furthermore, diffusion measured within T2 hyperintensities was correlated with cognitive and Rankin scale scores. OSullivan et al. 5 observed that MD was increased in WM lesions, normal-appearing WM, and normal-appearing gray matter; these DTI measurements were especially strongly correlated with executive functions. In a 2-year follow-up study, T2 lesion volumes and MD histogram metrics significantly changed, and the average MD correlated with clinical scores at baseline and the main predictor of clinical progression 6. Correlations have been found in a number of discrete regions in the WM of the frontal lobes, which underlie executive dysfunction in CADASIL 7. Mascalchi et al. 8 reported that compared to healthy controls, CADASIL patients showed extensive symmetric areas of increased MDradial diffusivity (RD) and decreased axial diffusivity (AD)FA that involved almost the entire hemispheric cerebral WM, thalami, and corpus callosum; additionally, FA was negatively correlated with extended Fazekas visual scores. Although AD and RD changes have been less well studied in CADASIL patients 8, they provide ad-ditional and highly valuable information in the study of other neurodegenerative diseases in both experimental and human studies 1011121314.\nMRI data have indicated that diffuse WM changes are associated with cognitive impairment in CADASIL. However, WM hyperintensities on normal MRI were not correlated with cognitive dysfunction in CADASIL 15. In contrast, DTI, which was used to predict disease progression, was related to impairment in executive function in CADASIL 567. According to a previous study, the disruption of either cortico-cortical or subcortical-cortical networks in the WM of the frontal lobe may contribute to motor deficits and executive dysfunction in CADASIL 16. At present, the correlations between DTI and global cognitive impairment have not been fully investigated. For example, AD and RD abnormalities have rarely been described in CADASIL, and how they relate to clinical scores is unclear. Furthermore, the relationship between local WM injury and cognitive function has not been systematically investigated. We hypothesize that CADASIL patients have extensive WM impairment, but different areas of WM impairment have different effects on cognitive function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine differences in brain microstructure between healthy controls and patients with CADASIL. A combination of FA, AD, and RD analyses was used in the present study to provide detailed and specific information to improve our understanding of the underlying neuropsychopathological mechanism of CADASIL. Moreover, correlations between clinical measures and local WM damage were systematically examined. In addition, CA-DASIL is a disorder that serves as a model for more common forms of subcortical ischemic strokes and pure vascular dementia. Thus, DTI studies performed on patients with CADASIL could provide insights into the vascular mechanisms underlying these diseases.",

      "text": "MRI data were acquired on a Siemens 3T Trio MR scanner with a 12-channel phased array coil. Structural MRI scans and fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging were performed. The parameters of the FLAIR sequence were as follows: repetition time, 9,000 ms; echo time, 93 ms; field of view, 200 (220 mm 2 ; number of slices, 30; and slice thickness, 3.5 mm). DTI acquisition involved a single-shot, spin-echo planar imaging sequence acquired in contiguous axial planes that covered the whole brain. Diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied in 64 noncollinear directions together with acquisition without diffusion weighting (b  0). The imaging parameters were set to the following values: repetition time  8,900 ms, echo time  86 ms, field of view  256  256 mm, matrix size  128  128, 70 contiguous slices, slice thickness  2 mm and b value  0 at 1,000 smm 2 . The subjects were instructed not to move during the scans, and a Siemens dedicated filler was used to prevent head movement.\nFazekas Scale Score WM hyperintensities were evaluated using quantitative analyses of follow-up FLAIR sequences. The degree of WM hyperintensity severity was assessed visually on axial FLAIR images according to the modified Fazekas scale 17,18, the most widely used scale to describe WM hyperintensity severity. This scale divides WM hyperintensities into periventricular and deep categories. Periventricular WM hyperintensities were graded according to the following patterns: 0  absent, 1  caps or a pencil-thin lining, 2  a smooth halo, and 3  irregular WM hyperintensities extending into the deep WM. Deep WM hyperintensities were graded according to the following patterns: 0  absent or single punctate foci, 1  multiple punctate foci, 2  beginning confluence of foci, and 3  large fused foci. The total scores were acquired by adding the periventricular and deep WM hyperintensity scores, and the results were compared.",

    "DiscussionConclusion": {
      "text": "In this study, patients with CADASIL showed extensive significant reductions in FA and increases in RD, AD, and MD. Furthermore, these WM microstructural alterations were significantly correlated with global cognitive scores. FA decreased and MD increased in patients with CADA-SIL, consistent with previous studies 45678. According to Mascalchi et al. 8, RD increased and AD decreased in the cerebral WM of CADASIL patients. The different results obtained for AD may be due to differences among the samples or the pathological stages of the samples.\nTo more comprehensively explore the behavior of the diffusion tensor in neurodegeneration, we performed tract-based spatial statistics analyses on FA maps as well as on AD, RD, and MD in both CADASIL patients and healthy controls. Based on our results, FA was decreased, while AD, RD, and MD were increased throughout the brain in CADASIL. These findings indicated that the neurodegeneration observed in CADASIL is associated with tensor variations that are predominantly proportional in all 3 dimensions. The magnitude of the impact of these processes on the diffusion tensor is unknown, but they may cause water molecules to diffuse faster in unanticipated directions. Both AD and RD increased; this effect is related to fiber tract loss, myelin sheath disruption during neurodegeneration, increased membrane permeability, intracellular compartment destruction, and glial alterations 12,20. The decrease observed in FA indicates that the increase in RD was more dramatic than the change in AD, which should lead to a significant reduction in FA. An ROI analysis confirmed this finding by showing that the RD, AD, and FA of altered brain regions were 33.50 higher, 14.87 higher, and 20.00 lower, respectively, in the CADASIL group than those in the healthy control group.\nCADASIL is associated with arterial smooth muscle degeneration and is linked to mutations in the Notch3 gene, which produces a transmembrane receptor that functions in cell-cell communication 21. However, how CADASIL causes WM degeneration is unclear. According to previous neuroimaging studies, there is an early decrease in cerebral blood flow and metabolism in CADASIL patients, suggesting chronic subcortical ischemia 2,22,23. Compromised cerebral hemodynamics probably arises from both structural and functional changes in brain arteries. Autopsy studies performed in patients with CADASIL have shown stenosis of arterioles in WM 24,25. Thus, the degradation of WM observed in CADASIL is probably due to a chronic hypoxic state within the WM resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion. Microvacuoles in myelin sheaths are associated with focal myelin degradation and occur in the absence of oligodendrocyte loss principally in cerebral WM in TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice, a model of preclinical CA-DASIL 26. Additionally, compared with controls, patients with CADASIL have a larger WM volume 27. Brain WM intramyelinic edema is consistently found in patients with CADASIL and mouse models with compromised ion and water homeostasis. In our study, the increases observed in MD, RD, and AD in CADASIL patients may have been due to WM edema. CADASIL is associated with arterial smooth muscle degeneration, and arterial smooth muscle degeneration induces a chronic hypoxic state within the WM, leading to the subsequent comprehensive chronic degeneration of WM, including WM edema, axonal injury, and demyelination 16.\nIn the present study, FA, MD, AD, and RD were significantly correlated with cognitive scores. These results show that CADASIL with greater global cognitive impairment is associated with extensive significant WM tract damage. In fact, WM hyperintensities on normal MRI were not correlated with cognitive dysfunction in CADASIL 15, and WM lesions or atrophy on MRI were not associated with cognitive decline during the progression of CADASIL in younger, mildly affected patients. In our study, FA, MD, AD, and RD were significantly correlated with cognitive scores. The DTI values of each patient were correlated with their Fazekas score, and the Fazekas score of each patient was correlated with their clinical scores. However, DTI values had a higher correlation coefficient with clinical scores than did the Fazekas score. DTI may be better than conventional MRI for describing WM damage in CADASIL patients. Our results also showed that FA, MD, AD, and RD were significantly correlated with mRs scores. The mRs scores are used to assess disability in patients, and our results indicated that WM tract damage affects cognitive function as well as the basic living ability. Furthermore, we found that WM impairment in different brain regions has different effects on cognitive function. For example, the DTI values in corpus callosum, bilateral anterior coronae radiatae, bilateral superior coronae radiatae, bilateral fornix (cres) stria terminalis, and bilateral tapeta were highly correlated with cognitive scores. However, there was no significant correlation between cognitive scores and WM In conclusion, compared with healthy controls, patients with CADASIL showed extensive significant reductions in FA and increases in RD, AD, and MD in the main WM skeleton of the whole brain. Decreased FA values in specific brain areas were significantly positively correlated with cognitive scores and negatively correlated with mRs scores in patients. Conversely, the increased AD, RD, and MD in specific brain areas were significantly and negatively correlated with MMSE and MoCA scores and positively correlated with mRs scores. Based on these data, we conclude that DTI can fully describe the physical phenomena that characterize WM degeneration in CADASIL. Additionally, these results contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of CADASIL.",

    "abstract": "Background Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies emphasize the role of vascular factors, including the glymphatic system, in AD pathogenesis, particularly in Aβ clearance. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS-Index) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive method to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo, showing glymphatic insufficiency in AD. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the function of the glymphatic system in individuals with AD versus healthy controls (HC), and to explore its association with Aβ, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive function. Methods DTI MRI data from three independent study cohorts (ActiGliA: AD n  16, Controls n  18; DELCODE: AD n  54, Controls n  67; ADNI: AD n  43, Controls n  49) were used to evaluate the perivascular space (PVS) integrity; a potential biomarker for glymphatic activity. The DTI-Along the Perivascular Space technique was used to measure water diffusion along PVS providing an index to assess the efficiency of the glymphatic systems waste clearance function. WMH load was quantified in FLAIR MRI using the lesion segmentation tool. We quantified WMHs volume within our defined region of interest (ROI) and excluded participants with any WMHs to avoid confounding the ALPS-Index. Associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD hallmark biomarkers, cognitive performance (MMSE) and clinical severity (CDR) were assessed.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the progressive deterioration of neural circuits leading to cognitive decline and dementia. While extensive research on the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and glial responses has been carried out, the importance of vascular contributions has long been recognized but sometimes overlooked in earlier studies 1. According to the amyloid hypothesis, an imbalance between the production and clearance of Aβ results in the accumulation and aggregation within the brain and triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events with the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles, loss of neurons and synaptic dysfunction ultimately resulting in dementia 2. The production of Aβ has received much attention as a therapeutic target against AD in recent years; less emphasis was placed on the modification of mechanisms related to Aβ clearance. It has been postulated that insufficient cerebral clearance of Aβ peptides which are produced at a normal rate account for most cases of sporadic AD 3. Until recently, transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was considered as the main mechanism to remove Aβ from the brain; however, newer findings support the existence of additional important mechanisms 4. Bulk-flow of interstitial fluid (ISF) mediated by astroglia and the recently discovered glymphatic vessels in the meninges probably also make a meaningful contribution to Aβ clearance 5. Previously, it was thought that about 75 of Aβ is cleared by BBB transport and only 10 by the glymphatic system. However, recent photon imaging studies in mice, using microscopy with fluorescent tracers, have suggested that the glymphatic system contributes to a larger part of Aβ clearance than previously thought 6. The glymphatic system comprises the transport of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after para-arterial influx and transport via aquaporin 4 channels into the interstitium, followed by convective intestinal transport to efflux via the perivenous space into the lymphatic system 7,8. This system regulated by astrocytes is assumed to play a major role in the drainage of brain metabolites, and its malfunction may lead to the accumulation of waste products and is related to AD pathogenesis 7,9. The glymphatic pathway has been visualized in rodents using a variety of imaging approaches; clinical imaging of the glymphatic pathway is an emerging field, and several innovative methods in humans intrathecal contrast agent injection has been used to visualize the glymphatic system 10, a rather invasive imaging approach. Recently a novel technique diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS_Index) using non-invasive MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based technique has been developed to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo 11. Numerous studies have shown glymphatic insufficiency in a variety of diseases using this approach, which measures the ratio of water diffusivity along the perivascular space 121314. In AD and older adults at risk for dementia a decreased ALPS-Index compared to healthy controls was reported in two previous studies 11,15.\nBesides the dysfunction of the glymphatic system there is increasing evidence suggesting that cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and AD not only share common risk factors, but also have additive harmful effects on cognitive function 16. Studies have demonstrated that reducing cardiovascular risk protects against AD 17. A two-hitsmechanism where BBB disruption as a first hit is followed by Aβ accumulation as a second hit ultimately leading to full-blown AD has been proposed 18. A vast number of studies demonstrated links between established AD biomarkers and vascular abnormalities in AD. It has been shown that Aβ 19, tau 20 and glucose metabolism 21 in AD are associated with microvascular damage, and it was suggested that vascular changes are among the earlies events in the course of the disease 22. A frequent finding in AD are white matter hyperintensities (WMH) observable on T2-weighted Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain MRI scans. The pathophysiological origin of WMH has not yet been fully understood. Associations with cerebrovascular damage, microglial and endothelial cell activation and glial reorganization have been reported frequently, suggesting that WMH is a proxy measure of white matter damage 23. Recent studies have also reported associations between white matter changes and both Aβ 24 and tau pathology 25. Additionally, the extent of WMH is correlated with cognitive impairment and an increased risk of dementia 26.\nIn our study, we first examined alterations in the glymphatic system integrity and function, specifically focusing on changes detected using the DTI-ALPS method, across three independent cohorts of individuals with AD compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we investigated the potential contamination of DTI-ALPS measurements by the concurrent presence of WMH in the regions analyzed, often ignored by previous analyses. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the ALPS-Index and both the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and Aβ as measured in PET imaging 27,28. However, to our knowledge, this is the first investigation that explicitly examines how impairments in the glymphatic system is associated with CSF Aβ levels. Furthermore, we assess the associations between glymphatic system impairments and cerebral small vessel disease, evidenced by WMH in FLAIR MRI.",

Healthy controls (HC) were defined as CDR  0 and Aβ negative for CSF. For the cohortspecific CSF cutoff values, please see the CSF biomarker section.

Parameters of this model fit were used to segment lesions by providing an estimate for the lesion probability for each voxel 38.\nTo enhance the robustness of our analysis, we developed a computational script to quantify the presence of WMHs within our defined ROI. In short, this script automates the quantification of WMH in specified ROIs by transforming hand-drawn DTI coordinates into FLAIR space, creating 5 mm spherical masks around these coordinates, and counting the intersecting WMH voxels. It efficiently processes multiple cases, facilitating the analysis of WMH load in defined brain regions. To and mitigate confounding of the ALPS-Index by WMHs, we decided to exclude participants exhibiting any level of WMH in our ROI (n  48) from analyses investigating correlations and associations between the ALPS-Index and biomarkers, WMH volume in the rest of the brain (outside of the ROI), and clinical markers. However, these excluded participants were analyzed separately to evaluate the specific impact of WMH within the ROI on the ALPS-Index. This decision was informed by the observed negative correlations between WMH and ALPS-Index in ADNI and DELCODE, both cohorts with the most WMH detected, which could potentially obscure the interpretation of our findings. For a better understanding of how the images were processed, see Fig. 4. Specifically, we excluded n  36 subjects, including AD and HC, from the ADNI, n  10 from the DELCODE, and n  2 participants from the ActiGliA dataset (see Tables 1 and2 in RESULTS). The rationale for this exclusion criterion is grounded in the premise that vascular anomalies could erroneously affect the interpretation of ALPS-Index measurements, thereby skewing the assessment of glymphatic function.",

      "text": "The ALPS-Index has gained prominence as a tool for measuring the glymphatic systems functionality in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsons disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, migraines, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, and traumatic brain injuries among others 394041424344. This study aimed to explore the association of the ALPS-Index with hallmarks of AD, such as The main results of our study were: (i) There was a significant group differences in ALPS indices between AD patients and HC across all cohorts, with AD patients showing lower ALPS indices. (ii) ALPS-Index was positively associated with Aβ42 and cognitive and clinical decline and (iii) WMH within a ROI is leading to lower ALPS indices. Our findings confirm earlier studies that have identified the ALPS-Index as a viable marker for disease progression and potentially for early detection of AD in very early stages, mild cognitive impairment, or even before the onset of symptoms. In a study by Zhong et al., AD patients showed significantly lower ALPS-Index compared to controls, and a decreased ALPS-Index with cognitive decline 15,45. Furthermore, we observed strong correlations between the ALPS-Index and CSF biomarkers, particularly Aβ42 and the Aβ42Aβ40 ratio. Higher CSF Aβ42 levels consistently correlated with higher ALPS indices across the cohorts, supporting the hypothesis that glymphatic clearance mechanisms are closely tied to amyloid-beta metabolism. Notably, this is the first study to establish such a relationship with CSF biomarkers, highlighting its unique contribution to the field of AD research. Similarly, other studies show correlations between ALPS and extracellular perivascular space (ePVS), which suggest a shared pathology between impaired glymphatic function and AD-specific markers such as amyloid-beta aggregation, as observed in both PET scans and CSF samples 28,46,47. While our analysis initially showed no significant differences in WMH volume or count between AD and HC groups within the ADNI cohort, a more detailed examination within the DELCODE and ActiGlia cohort revealed significant correlations between WMH count and ALPS indices. This suggests that WMH may impact the measurement of the ALPS-Index, possibly due to changes in bulk diffusivity caused by the WMH, though an association between AD pathology and cerebrovascular factors cannot be ruled out. It has been shown in several previous studies that WMH are correlated to glymphatic impairment and the higher the vascular damage the lower the ALPS-Index 484950. One study in particular highlighted an interesting L-shaped association of the DTI-ALPS-Index with the presence and severity of CSVD (cortical small vessel disease) measured by taking WMH into account 50. The graph could indicate a threshold level of glymphatic function beyond which WMH begin to significantly impact brain health. When ALPS-Index values are above this threshold, WMH values remain low and stable. However, once the ALPS-Index falls below this critical value, WMH values start to increase sharply. This suggests that a minimally functional glymphatic system might be sufficient to prevent or limit WMH, but any further decline leads to rapid deterioration. At lower levels of WMH, the vascular impairment might be mild and not significantly affect glymphatic function. However, with more extensive vascular damage (as WMH increases), there may be a critical point where glymphatic impairment becomes pronounced, leading to the observed decline in the ALPS-Index. This L-shaped association might be a reason to why especially smaller cohorts might not show too big of a correlation between ALPS and WMH. Another study was able to show how DTI-ALPS-Index partially mediated the association of Choroid plexus volume (CPv) with both WMH load and growth and how CPv was correlated with slower glymphatic clearance in the brain-again highlighting the close relationship between WMH, vascular health and the clearance of the brain done by the GS 49.",

These findings were significant in both the ADNI and DELCODE cohorts but not in ActiGliA, likely due to the small number of subjects with WMH in these specific ROIs (n  4). Once we combined all three cohorts together and looked at correlation with age, sex, and group as confounding variables, we found significant negative correlations in all three ALPS indices, likely due to vascular impairments in these regions affecting measurements of diffusivity along the x-axis. This highlights the necessity of considering vascular damage when interpreting ALPS-Index changes, as such damage can mimic or obscure changes attributable to AD pathology. Crucially, our findings also revealed significant correlations between MMSE and CDR scores and the ALPS-Index across all three cohorts, indicating that glymphatic system impairment is associated with decline in cognitive performance and increased dementia severity. These findings are in line with several previous studies suggesting a correlation between ALPS-Index and cognitive decline in AD 11,15,27.\nThe observed differences in ALPS indices between the left and right hemispheres suggest variations in diffusivity along perivascular spaces, potentially reflecting asymmetries in glymphatic system function.

Several factors could contribute to these hemispheric differences. Anatomical variations in the vascular and perivascular architecture between hemispheres may influence the efficiency of glymphatic clearance 52. Functional lateralization of the brain, particularly differences in neuronal activity or metabolic demands, could also play a role, as glymphatic function is closely tied to cerebrovascular dynamics and interstitial fluid flow. Furthermore, asymmetrical distribution of white matter hyperintensities or regional variations in AQP4 expression, which regulates fluid transport, might differentially affect glymphatic function. These findings underscore the need for further research to understand how hemispheric differences in glymphatic activity might contribute to or result from neurodegenerative processes like Alzheimers disease.",

      "text": "While our study provides valuable insights into the importance of glymphatic impairment in AD, it is important to acknowledge several limitations that may affect the generalizability and interpretation of our findings. Potential for WMH to confound the ALPS-Index calculations remains a critical concern. The ALPS-Index is predicated on assessing changes in diffusivity along the x-axis, representing alterations in fluid dynamics within perivascular spaces-a key factor in AD pathology.\nOne significant concern is that the ALPS index primarily measures predominant water diffusion along the perivascular space, yet it does not directly validate glymphatic system functionality. Moreover, this method lacks the ability to differentiate between water movement within or outside the perivascular space and cannot assess the direction of flow. This measurement can be confounded by the presence of vascular damage, such as that represented by WMH, which can similarly affect diffusivity metrics. Further research is essential to develop strategies that effectively differentiate between changes due to perivascular space alterations and those resulting from vascular damage. Additionally, variations in imaging techniques, resolution, and ROI placement impact the reproducibility and interpretation of the ALPS index. To our knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates WMH into the calculation of the ALPS-Index 11,27,53. This studys exclusion of individuals with pronounced WMH within the ROI was an attempt to address this issue; however, future studies should incorporate more comprehensive methodologies to mitigate such confounding factors. Our studys scope was limited to early-stage AD cases, primarily within demographically homogeneous populations. Future studies should aim to include more diverse populations to enhance the representativeness and generalizability of the findings, and they should incorporate follow-up periods to assess the enduring effects of the variables studied. We were unable to control for all potential confounding variables, such as lifestyle factors and genetic predispositions, which might influence the results. Future studies should consider a broader range of confounding factors. The relatively small sample size for WMH in ROI may limit the statistical power to detect significant differences and relationships.\nLastly, other studies also touched upon the role of inflammation, microglial activation, and reactive astrogliosis in impairing aquaporin-4 (AQP4), leading to discrepancies in CSF flow and accumulation of brain waste products such as Aβ and tau 31,545556. Extending this speculation, perhaps regional loss of AQP4 may explain subregion-dependent susceptibility to neurodegeneration by driving local interstitial fluid and protein stagnation increasing the risk of aggregation prone proteins. This inflammation might be a precursor to or a consequence of protein aggregation, suggesting a complex, possibly bidirectional relationship between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The interplay between AQP4, neuroinflammation, and the glymphatic system may contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative processes 57.\nWhile there are some similarities between our study and the work by Shu-Yi Huang et al., 2024 46, there are several significant differences that distinguish our research. The previous study primarily focuses on longitudinal cohorts and examines how ALPS might be used as a clinical marker to track disease progression or detect Alzheimers disease. In contrast, our study utilizes three distinct cohorts in a cross-sectional analysis to explore how ALPS correlates with WMH and other AD-specific biomarkers, with a particular focus on WMH found in the ROI.\nOne of the key distinctions in our methodology is the use of WMH as a biomarker, specifically excluding participants with WMH in the ROI, allowing us to investigate the localized effects of WMH on ALPS. This aspect was not specifically addressed in the earlier study. Additionally, while the previous study utilized the PACC to measure cognitive function, we used MMSE and CDR, which are more commonly used in clinical settings and provide different insights into cognitive status in our cohort.\nOverall, our study aims to provide new insights into how WMH in the ROI influences ALPS and its potential Abbreviations: ALPS_R, ALPS_L: calculated ALPS index on right R and left L hemisphere of the brain. ALPS_comb: combined ALPS index, by calculating the mean of Index for right and left hemishphere; adj-R 2 : adjusted R 2 ; SE: Standard error;  significant difference with P  0.05. Calculated with multivariate linear regression analyses, using age, sex, and years of education as confounding variables to correlate with other Alzheimers disease biomarkers, offering a novel approach distinct from the longitudinal focus of the prior research.\nIn conclusion, our findings underscore the potential of the ALPS-Index as a biomarker for Alzheimers Disease, albeit with considerations for the influence of WMH on its accuracy and reliability. The variations observed across cohorts highlight the complexity of AD pathology and the need for comprehensive approaches in biomarker development, including associative analyses beyond imaging, such as those offered by animal models, histological examinations, and other investigative methods. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of cerebrovascular factors in AD and refine neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring, with a particular focus on cognitive implications in our aging population.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) detects white matter damage in neuro-psychiatric disorders, but data on reliability of DTI measures across more than two scanners are still missing. In this study we assessed multicenter reproducibility of DTI acquisitions based on a physical phantom as well as brain scans across 16 scanners. In addition, we performed DTI scans in a group of 26 patients with clinically probable Alzheimers disease (AD) and 12 healthy elderly controls at one single center. We determined the variability of fractional anisotropy (FA) measures using manually placed regions of interest as well as automated tract based spatial statistics and deformation based analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) of FA was 6.9 for the physical phantom data. The mean CV across the multicenter brain scans was 14 for tract based statistics, and 29 for deformation based analysis. The degree of variation was higher in less organized fiber tracts. Our findings suggest that a clinical and physical phantom study involving more than two scanners is indispensable to detect potential sources of bias and to reliably estimate effect size in multicenter diagnostic trials using DTI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "In recent years, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become a widely used tool to determine microstructural integrity of subcortical fiber tracts in healthy aging and neuro-psychiatric disease (Teipel et al., 2007;Friedman et al., 2008;Matsuo et al., 2008;Douaud et al., 2009;Kieseppa et al., 2011). The exact molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying specific changes in DTI derived measures of fiber tract integrity remain still widely unexplored. DTI is sensitive to axonal growth and myelination during brain maturation (Huppi and Dubois, 2006;Lebel et al., 2008). Furthermore, it is sensitive to axonal demyelination and lesions of the axonal membrane in both aging and neurodegeneration (Beaulieu, 2002).\nInitial studies have set out to determine the diagnostic value of DTI in neuro-psychiatric disorders. Multivariate pattern of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity as scalar markers of fiber tract changes discriminate patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) or schizophrenia from age-matched healthy controls with an accuracy that matches the accuracy of established MRI based volumetric measures (Ardekani et al., 2011;Friese et al., 2010). Of particular interest will be the application of DTI measures in presymptomatic stages of neuropsychiatric disorders, however, studies on these early stages are rare (Rosas et al., 2006;Muller et al., 2007;Ringman et al., 2007).\nThe future use of DTI as a diagnostic biomarker in clinical studies on neuro-psychiatric disorders requires reliability and stability of measures across multiple sites employing different scanners with different field strengths and scan parameters. Currently, evidence relating to the multicenter stability of DTI derived markers is limited. Only few published studies have investigated variability of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity between two different scanners in healthy volunteers (Cercignani et al., 2003;Pfefferbaum et al., 2003;Vollmar et al., 2011) and between three different scanners using a human brain and phantom study (Zhu et al., 2011). One of these studies only reported multicenter effects for the whole brain (Cercignani et al., 2003), two other studies investigated a limited number of brain regions (Pfefferbaum et al., 2003;Vollmar et al., 2011). Studies comparing more than three scanners are still lacking.\nIn this study, we measured between scanner variability across 16 scanners from different manufacturers employing different field strengths. Initially, we had set out to use a common acquisition protocol specific for a given field strength. However, during the course of the study acquisition parameters could not fully be met by every center leading to variation in acquisition parameters across the scanners. Measures were performed on one single healthy subject scanned at each site as well as using a recently developed DTI physical fiber phantom (Laun et al., 2009). We used three different analyses: (i) manual region of interest measurement, (ii) an individual fiber tract model using tract based spatial statistics, and (iii) voxel-based analysis across the entire white matter. We determined the effect size of differences between patients with AD and healthy control subjects based on monocenter and multicenter variability to illustrate the relative magnitude of inter-site differences in FA values compared to biologically meaningful differences of FA values between groups.",

The phantom was placed in the locally available head coil together with a large standard bottle phantom provided by the manufacturer of the respective scanner to adjust for coil load. The center of the phantom object was positioned in the center of the head coil so that the middle of the phantom was placed in the isocenter of the magnetic field. Prior to scanning automated shimming was used to adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field to the phantom object. If automatic shimming yielded insufficient results (visible as shape deformations of the scanned object), manual shimming was employed.

      "text": "Prior to analysis, one rater (S.R.) visually assessed scan quality as described above. Criteria of quality assessment were obvious deformations, artifacts (such as folding, ghosting, and movement etc.) and signal homogeneity.\nWe used two different automated approaches to determine regional variability of FA measurements: first, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) v1.2 implemented in FSL 4.1 (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford, UK, http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukanalysisresearchtbss) (Smith et al., 2006), second, high dimensional warping based on coregistered structural MRI scans. As common step for both approaches, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using FDT (FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox integrated in the FSL software), and then brain-extracted using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) (Smith, 2002).\n2.3.2.1. TBSS. TBSS allows spatial reorientation of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps into standard space without systematic effects of spatial transformation on fiber tract directionality and without the need to select a spatial smoothing kernel that may impact the effects of interest. All subjects FA data (after brain extraction) were aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (Andersson et al., 2007a,b), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999). Next, the mean FA image was created and thinned to obtain a mean FA skeleton which represents the centers of all tracts common to the different scans. Each scanners aligned FA data was then projected onto this skeleton and the resulting data fed into voxelwise cross-scanner analysis.\nIn addition to voxel-wise analysis of fiber tract maps, we extracted mean FA values in predefined fiber tracts using a region of interest approach. We used white matter regions in MNI standard space as represented in the John Hopkins University (JHU) Fiber Tract-based Atlas of Human White Matter Anatomy (Wakana et al., 2004). This atlas template is implemented in the FSL software. We used an in-house written Matlab script to overlay the white matter atlas regions with the individual fiber tract skeletons. We extracted mean FA values for corpus callosum genu, body and splenium, fornix, as well as bilateral posterior thalamic radiation, sagittal stratum, cingulum, hippocampus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus.\n2.3.2.2. High dimensional warping. The B0 images of the DTI scans were spatially aligned to the corresponding structural MRI scans using 12 parameter affine coregistration as implemented in SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging). The T1-weighted MRI data were partitioned into different tissue classes by using a unified segmentation approach (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) to obtain gray and white matter maps in native space. These gray and white matter maps were then registered to a common space representing the average across scanners in native space using the DARTEL toolbox, an efficient large deformation diffeomorphic framework implemented in SPM8 that has demonstrated to minimize anatomical variations between scans (Ashburner, 2007). The DARTEL flow-fields were applied to the coregistered FA maps to spatially transform them in a common space. The FA maps were resliced to a final isotropic voxel size of 1.5 mm 3 . The white matter template in the common standard space was binarized at a probability of 80 of a voxel to belong to white matter and used to exclude all voxels outside the white matter from the FA maps.\nIn a second analysis of the FA maps, the TBSS-based study specific fiber tract template was used to mask the FA maps. This was done to avoid an overestimation of variability in the deformation based analysis due to the inclusion of more peripheral fiber tracts compared to the TBSS analysis. Scan parameters of scans where data quality was sufficient for further analysis (for details see Section 3.1). Scan parameters from the 14 scanners where data were available. Data were excluded in two cases where the brain was not entirely covered by the employed sequence.",

This model assumes that inter-scanner and inter-subject components of FA variability are independent. This assumption cannot be proven based on the available data.

In all of these cases the shape of the phantom object showed obvious deviations from a circular cross-section.

The mean phantom specific FA was 0.6, the CV ranged from 5.2 in the left ROI to 9.8 in the upper ROI, with a mean of 6.9 across the four ROIs.

To determine the effect of differences in acquisition parameters, we compared the variability between these 3 scans with the variability across all 56 possible combinations of 3 out of the 8 scans. The average CV of these combinations was 6.1.\nTo assess a potential effect of positioning of the phantom within the head coil we had measured the phantom in the center of the head coil and 2 cm each anterior, posterior, above and below the center of the head coil in one scanner (site XI, Magnetom Avanto scanner).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We investigated the multicenter variability of FA measurements derived from DTI scans of a physical phantom object and a clinical brain study. Scanning involved 12 radiological expert centers across four European countries employing 16 scanners from three different manufacturers combining 1.5 and 3.0 T machines. The phantom data could not sufficiently be acquired by half of the scanners, in all cases due to problems with the shim. From those eight phantom scans that reached sufficient quality, the variability of FA measures ranged between 5 and 9. The average CV of the FA values of the brain scans ranged between 14 for tract based statistical analysis and 29 for deformation based analysis. These values are considerably higher than the variability of gray and white matter density obtained from the anatomical MRI scans in our and a previous study (Ewers et al., 2006).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first international multicenter reliability and phantom study using more than three different MRI scanners. Unfortunately, acquisition of the phantom data was more difficult than expected at eight of the 16 scanners. The physical phantom had originally been developed for single site studies on the effects of different gradient fields on DTI measures (Laun et al., 2009) on a 1.5 T scanner. Recent studies on the diffusion phantom have indicated that the saline doped agarose may act as shield for the signal inside the phantom. This effect is more pronounced at high field strengths and this may explain, why the load was insufficient mainly at 3 T, where seven of the ten 3 Tesla scanners, but only two of the seven 1.5 Tesla scanners had problems with the data quality. However, the fact that shimming was possible in three of the ten 3 T scanners also indicates that other factors have played an important role in the final results. For future use the phantom will need to be modified in respect to saline concentration, a work which is presently ongoing.\nThe successful phantom scans showed a coefficient of variation of FA values around 6.9. When we used only three scans with identical scanning parameters, the CV was reduced to 5.2 compared to 6.1 for any possible triple selected out of the original eight scans. These findings suggest a modest effect of differences in hardware and acquisition parameters across sites relative to overall inter-site variability. This notion is supported by the findings of a recent study that reported a standard deviation of FA measurements ranging between 0.039 and 0.047 for a physical phantom object across three scanners from the same vendor with similar hardware and acquisition parameters (Zhu et al., 2011). Our standard deviation values ranging between 0.033 and 0.053 across eight sites with different hardware and acquisition parameters are very close to the values of this previous study using homogeneous scan parameters. In conclusion, a physical phantom study seems helpful to assess variability of FA measures across scanners.",

    "CV": {
      "text": "The quality of the brain scans was generally high across the sites. The large majority of studies have investigated variability of DTI brain scans only across two scanners. Across two scanners and averaged across 10 healthy subjects, the between scanner CV for a voxel-based analysis ranged between 1.5 and 2.2 for white matter voxels only (Pfefferbaum et al., 2003). In another study, using histogram derived mean FA values across the entire brain, the CV between two scanners was 7.7 across eight healthy subjects scanned twice on two different scanners (Cercignani et al., 2003). When we determined pair-wise CVs from our data, the mean CV across all 91 pairs out of 14 scans was 11.3, ranging between 8.3 and 16.0 for the TBSS data. One previous study investigated inter-scanner coefficients of variation across three different brain regions covering posterior corpus callosum, uncinate fascicle and frontal lobe white matter (Vollmar et al., 2011). In our analysis across 14 scanners, the CV based on the voxel-wise variation was about 6 for the splenium and 11 and 9 for the right and left uncinate fascicle, respectively. Based on the averaged FA values within each region the coefficients of variation became smaller, with 4.2 for the splenium and 8.1 and 6.1 for right and left uncinate fascicle, respectively. This agrees with a previous study (Vollmar et al., 2011) where ROI analysis with averaging of values within a given region reduced the variation compared to unsmoothed voxel-based data.\nOur data suggest that the multi-center reliability of DTI measures could not be estimated only from the comparison of two scanners. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we determined the density distribution of the mean variation between any possible pair of the 14 scanners in the corpus callosum splenium. The distribution of variation ranged from b1 to almost 12. The variation between two scanners that has been reported by (Vollmar et al., 2011) for the same brain region was about 2 and falls within the range of our data. However, a single estimate based on only two scanners does not give an accurate estimate of the range of variability across our 14 scanners. In contrast to the previous studies (Cercignani et al., 2003;Pfefferbaum et al., 2003;Vollmar et al., 2011) using more than two scanners employing different field strengths, hardware specifications and scan parameters will be the more realistic condition for future DTI multicenter studies. In addition, the comparison of inter-site to intrasite variation will be relevant for future studies across a larger number of sites than in the previously published studies (Cercignani et al., 2003;Pfefferbaum et al., 2003;Vollmar et al., 2011;Zhu et al., 2011), as the differences in hardware and acquisition parameters will not only affect direct inter-site differences but also difference in intra-site variability that may be relevant for detection of between group effects. This will be an important line of research for future studies.\nThe TBSS approach uses an a priori model of fiber tracts to extract FA values in these tracts from individual FA maps without the use of anatomical information from structural MRI data. The deformation based approach uses the anatomical information from a highresolution structural scan and provides a high-dimensional matching of the data into a study specific common space. The mean variability as determined by the CV value was about 14 for TBSS analysis, yielding considerably lower variability measures than deformation based analysis of FA maps. This is further supported by the higher correlation between voxels across the scanners for the TBSS compared to the deformation based analysis. The correlation of TBSS derived FA values was similar to that obtained from a voxel-based analysis of FA values between two different scanners (Pfefferbaum et al., 2003).\nThe deformation based analysis of FA values yielded higher variation than the TBSS analysis. This analysis includes areas at the border between white matter and gray matter which have a high variability in FA values. These areas are not contained within the fiber tract model underlying the TBSS analysis. Even when these areas were excluded by using the TBSS based study specific fiber tract template to mask the FA maps, the CV was higher in the deformation based than the TBSS data. The TBSS algorithm searches perpendicular to the local fiber tract skeleton structure for the maximum value in the individual FA map (Smith et al., 2006). Through this approach the differences between scanners will be attenuated as a voxel of highest intensity is selected as representation of a given fiber tract localization. This is also illustrated when we plot the FA values in a given region, such as the corpus callosum from TBSS and deformation based analysis across the sites. As shown in supplementary Fig. 3, the FA values are higher, their spread is smaller for the TBSS analysis than for the deformation based analysis. One could assume that the TBSS approach may be more likely to underestimate fiber tract changes in neurodegenerative disorders compared to deformation based analysis, because it focuses on voxels of highest intensity in the neighborhood of large fiber tracts. TBSS has shown to be sensitive towards neurodegenerative tract changes (Ciccarelli et al., 2009;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Stricker et al., 2009;Teipel et al., 2011), but there are no studies available that directly compare the sensitivity of a TBSS based approach and a deformation based approach for FA data analysis.\nIt is important to note that the extent of variation between scanners was inversely correlated with the FA value of the underlying fiber tract. Fiber tracts with one main direction of fibers, such as corpus callosum splenium, showed a lower CV compared to fiber tracts with lower FA and more crossing fibers, such as fasciculus longitudinalis superior. This finding concurs with a previous study on a group of 20 healthy subjects scanned twice on the same scanner (Marenco et al., 2006). In these subjects CV values showed a marked variability across regions with lowest values within centers of structures and lowest values at the edges. Particularly low values were seen in corpus callosum areas and other highly organized fiber systems. The previous study (Marenco et al., 2006), however, had not correlated FA and CV values so that a direct inference on underlying structural organization is not possible. These findings suggest that multicenter effects will not be homogeneously distributed across the brain, but will induce bias in diagnostic studies. An inverse association between fiber tract organization and variability (Supplementary Fig. 2) implies that fiber tracts with higher FA, having smaller variation across scanners, will be more likely to show group differences compared to fiber tracts with lower FA and higher variation across scanners, irrespective of the underlying neurobiological group differences.\nWith DTI sequences, susceptibility related deformations play a potential role for between scanner variation. As can be seen from Figs. 1 and3, very high CV values occurred in areas near to the scull basis, suggesting a contribution from susceptibility related field inhomogeneities. Gradient field maps may be used to correct for magnetic field inhomogeneities to at least partly account for these effects. This will be an interesting issue to explore in future studies.\nDifferences in the numbers of diffusion gradients across scanners could potentially have increased the variability of FA measures. However, the overall variability was only modestly reduced when derived from a subset of scans from 6 Magnetom Trio scanners, where 12 gradient directions and identical TRTE were used. When we determined the CV only from these scans, the mean CV using TBSS was 12.3, median 10.2, compared to a mean of 14.4, median 12.3, when the variability was determined across all available scans irrespective of scanner type or differences in sequence parameters. With the deformation based analysis, the mean CV across the 6 Magnetom Trio scans was 30.1, median 29.1, compared to a mean CV of 29.5, median 26.9, across all scanners. This extends the findings from a previous study using simulated data and experimental data on one single subject scanned using different diffusion weighting schemes (Landman et al., 2007). This study suggested that within the limits that are met by a clinical protocol with more than six gradient directions, the differences in DTI contrasts due to different numbers of diffusion gradients are relatively small relative to the variability of FA measures between sessions. This also agrees with the comparison of the standard deviation of TBSS derived measurements in our human study ranging between 0.012 and 0.30 across 14 sites, and the standard deviation of FA measurements across three homogeneous scanners ranging between 0.01 and 0.20 in a previous study (Zhu et al., 2011). These data underscore the notion that the effect of different hardware and acquisition parameters (within certain limits) is modest in comparison to the overall level of intersite variability. Due to the differences in FA baseline values, however, we think that for interpretation of inter-site variation of human brain scans, the coefficient of variation is a more relevant measure than the standard deviation (precision) alone.\nWe used data from a group of AD patients and controls gathered at one single center to illustrate the relative magnitude of inter-site variation in FA values compared to biologically meaningful differences in FA values. The extent of variation between scanners was similar to the extent of variation of FA values between these two groups. Thus, multicenter acquisition adds a clinically significant amount of variation to between group comparisons and has an impact on group size estimates for multicenter diagnostic studies. We used an additive model of scanner variance to the between group effects, assuming independence between both sources of variability. This additive model will give a rather conservative estimate of multicenter effect size. When both sources of variability are dependent on each other, this would reduce the denominator and lead to higher estimates of effect sizes.",

      "text": "In summary, we found clinically significant variation of FA measures across multiple scanners both using a physical phantom object and brain scans. The use of tract based spatial statistics reduced the effect of multicenter variation, most likely due to the a priori information and the selection of peak intensity voxels inherent in this analytical approach. Although we used a large range of scanner types and field strengths and experienced some variation in scan parameters, the amount of variability of FA measures was only modestly reduced when focusing on a subset of scanners with identical build-up and scanning parameters. This suggests that the variability of FA measures can only partly be controlled through the use of identical scanner types and acquisition parameters in multicenter studies. In addition, our data indicate that determining multicenter effects based on only two scanners will underestimate inter-scanner variability across multiple sites. The inter-site variation systematically varied with the degree of organization of fiber tracts, with more highly organized fiber tracts exhibiting a lower degree of variation. Our findings suggest that a clinical and physical phantom study is indispensable to detect potential sources of diagnostic bias and allow for reliable effect size estimates in multicenter diagnostic studies using DTI measures as biomarkers. As international and national networks for diagnosis of neuro-psychiatric disorders set out to implement DTI into the multicenter scanning program (Jack et al., 2011), the assessment of multicenter variability of these relatively new technologies will gain increasing clinical relevance in the near future (Bokde et al., 2009).

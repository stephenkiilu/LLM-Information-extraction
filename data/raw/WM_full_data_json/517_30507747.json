    "abstract": "Background New PET tracers could have a substantial impact on the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD), particularly if they are accompanied by optimised image analysis and machine learning methods. Fractal dimension (FD) analysis, a measure of shape complexity, has been proven useful in MRI but its application to fluorine-18 amyloid PET has not yet been demonstrated. Shannon entropy (SE) has also been proposed as a measure of image complexity in DTI imaging, but it is not yet widely used in radiology. Materials and methods In this study, one volumetric FD method and one volumetric SE method were applied to fluorine-18-flutemetamol and fluorine-18-florbetapir 3D amyloid images from 65 and 281 participants, respectively, including healthy volunteers, and patients with probable Alzheimers disease (pAD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results The group average FD of white matter surface and SE of white matter volume for healthy volunteers were higher than for pAD patients. Both FD and SE are effective in the identification of MCI patients who progress to pAD during the 2-year follow-up (ground truth). Finally, we developed a support vector machine multimodal classification framework using both PET and MRI features, which showed higher accuracy compared to traditional standard uptake value ratio or using PET alone. The classification accuracy for flutemetamol and florbetapir is 88.9 and 83.3, respectively, for MCI progression, which is competitive with existing literature. Conclusion The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of FD and SE methods for the analysis of brain PET scans in early AD diagnosis and in the prediction of MCI-AD conversion.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. The brain changes of AD may begin 20 or more years before symptoms appear 1.\nThe first PET tracer used to image β-amyloid plaques was 11 C-Pittsburgh compound-B 2. Due to the limited availability of 11 C-Pittsburgh compound-B with its short halflife, 18 F-labelled alternatives have been developed, which allow off-site production and regional distribution. Fluorine-18 ( 18 F)-flutemetamol, 18 F-florbetapir and 18 F-florbetaben have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. Abnormal uptake in grey matter causes a disruption of the characteristic white matter pattern caused by nonspecific white matter binding 3. These scans are generally interpreted visually.\nA separate group from healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with probable Alzheimers disease (pAD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate cognitive state between normal aging and dementia. Patients with MCI, especially MCI involving memory problems, are more likely to develop AD and other dementias 4. According to this progression, MCI patients can subsequently be classified as progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) or stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) 5.\nIn recent years, the focus for image analysis has gradually evolved from classification between healthy control and disease patients to classification between pMCI and sMCI. Most of the earlier studies for MCI conversion were based on a single modality. Min et al. 6 developed a joint learning of optimum representation of features from multiple atlases using maximum margin approach. The method was applied to MRI with sensitivity and specificity of 76.4 and 70.8, respectively. Another recent singlemodality study 7 applied a novel relationship-induced multitemplate learning method for automatic diagnosis of AD and MCI on MRI data. The achieved sensitivity and specificity were 87.9 and 75.5, respectively.\nMore recent studies have explored classification based on multimodality data. Cheng et al. 8 integrated a kernelbased maximum mean discrepancy criterion and a manifold regularization function into a combined learning algorithm for both feature selection and classification.\nThree modalities were used here: MRI, fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and cerebrospinal fluid. The sensitivity and specificity achieved were 85.3 and 73.3, respectively. Chen et al. 9 proposed an embedded novel statistical learning approach in a multikernel framework for longitudinal, multimodal data. They achieved 91 accuracy for pMCI versus sMCI classification. These results demonstrate promising classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods for single modality based MCI conversion classification.\nA recent review 10 highlights that the use of novel features from amyloid PET to classify MCI to AD progression has not been widely explored. In this work, we apply fractal dimension (FD) analysis, a measure of uptake pattern complexity, to amyloid PET scans. As the disease progress and plaques build, the characteristic white matter pattern seen in normal participants becomes increasingly obscured by the presence of uptake in grey matter. This leads to a decrease of the complexity of the isocontours of the PET images. We hypothesise that this decrease in complexity can be detected using FD analysis. This is the approach we demonstrate in the present work.\nShannon entropy (SE) is an alternative complexity measure to FD that quantifies the information content of the data 11. While SE has been used in ECG analysis 12, it is not well-known or widely used in radiology. Recently, SE 13 was investigated as a diagnostic tool in patients with mild traumatic brain injury in diffusion tensor imaging, to differentiate between those with and without post-traumatic migraines. The results show that white matter damage from a mild traumatic injury may cause some decrease of image complexity that results in lower SE. To our knowledge, SE has not been used in the study of PET images up to date.\nIn addition, many previous works have shown that MRI offers information complementary to PET-derived features such as morphological features 14. Daoqiang et al. 15 proposed a multimodal classification framework for MCI conversion prediction, and they found that the multimodality method shows considerably better performance, compared to the case of using biomarkers from an individual modality. More recently, Juergen et al. 16 developed a meta-analysis based support vector machine (SVM) classification model using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and MRI, which outperformed single modality as well.\nAfter the calculation of specific features, a range of classifiers have been used in related work. Among these, SVMs have been used for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD with relatively high accuracy. Liu et al. 17 proposed an inherent structure-based multiview learning method using multiple templates for ADMCI classification, with an SVM classifier used to draw the final decision. They achieved a classification accuracy of 80.9. Costafreda et al. 18 also combined the shape and volumetric features of the hippocampus for SVM-based AD conversion prediction. Their model correctly predicted MCI conversion to AD with an accuracy of 80.\nIn this study, we propose, for the first time, the application of FD and SE to the analysis of complexity of amyloid PET images. We augment FD and SE by combining these with standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) and MRI features generated from the FreeSurfer pipeline, feeding these into an SVM classifier to identify AD and predict MCI progression.",

    "Data": {
      "text": "Two sets of data were used in the preparation of this article. The first was obtained from GE Healthcare (Oslo, Norway), and included 18 F-flutemetamol PET and MRI scans for 65 participants (24 HV, 23 pAD and 18 MCI, divided into nine sMCI and nine pMCI). The participants were recruited into the study from multiple clinical study sites. Details of the trial are described on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT00785759). To diagnose pAD and assess MCI progression, there was an initial assessment at study enrolment (baseline) with a subsequent assessment 2 years later. The clinical assessment included physical symptoms, blood tests and a variety of mental tests. The flutemetamol image dimensions are 128  128  81 with a voxel size of 2.13 mm  2.13 mm  2 mm. Screening MRI scanning was performed for each patient prior to PET scanning. MRI were acquired using 3D T1-weighted sequence with the whole brain in the field-of-view for all images.\nOn the day of PET imaging, each patient received an intravenous dose of 18 F-flutemetamol as a bolus injection. The target activity of a single administration of 18 F-flutemetamol injection was 185 MBq. Three scanning sites were used: Liege and Leuven in Belgium and Rigshospitalet in Denmark. The images were acquired 30 min after the injection and were analysed by five expert clinicians who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis and all other clinical findings; the consensus of this blinded image evaluation (BIE) was available for our study. The gold standard was assessed at 2 years followup for AD conversion by measuring ranges of regional cerebral to cerebellum tracer uptake ratios.\nFor 18 F-florbetapir data, 36 pAD, 82 HV, 29 pMCI and 134 sMCI 18 F-florbetapir images with corresponding MRI were obtained from the ADNI database 19. The PET and MRI volumes for each patient selected for this study were acquired no more than 12 months apart. As part of the ADNI protocol, patients were assessed at baseline and 2-year follow-up using a combination of neuropsychological testing, imaging and fluid sample analysis. AD conversion for MCI patients was established using the 2-year assessment: patients were labeled as sMCI if they remained in the MCI assessment and pMCI if the MCI label changed to AD in the follow-up.",

    "Preprocessing": {
      "text": "All the florbetapir images had been already preprocessed by ADNI: MRI and PET scans from each patient were co-registered, and the image from their baseline PET scan was then reoriented into a standard 160  160  96 voxel image grid, comprising 1.5 mm cubic voxels. This image grid was oriented such that the anterior-posterior axis of the patient is parallel to the AC-PC line. The corresponding MRI have dimensions 256  256  196 with a voxel size of 1 mm  1 mm  1.2 mm. Flutemetamol images were obtained in their original state from the GE study and thus needed to be preprocessed as follows. As a first step, image intensities were rescaled to 0-255, and then the segmentation of the white matter in the PET images was performed using a hysteresis thresholding method 20. This segmentation method performs a dual thresholding operation on a grayscale image using two threshold values. We followed this by an erosion operation. The white matter masks calculated in this way were used in two ways: (a) to binarise the original images for the calculation of FD; and (b) to remove all image values outside of the mask (by making them zero), while keeping the original image intensities inside the mask: the images obtained in this way were used for the calculation of SE. Examples of original T1-weighted MRI, flutemetamol PET images, with their corresponding segmented label maps are shown in Fig. 1.\nSecondly, the PET volumes were rigidly registered to their corresponding MR volumes using FSLs FLIRT software 21. The MR volumes were then affinely registered to Montreal Neurological Institute space using Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 12 22, and the resulting transformations were applied to the PET volumes.",

    "Calculation of fractal dimension using the box-counting method": {
      "text": "In order to calculate features based on fractals, here we applied a box-counting (dilation) method to compute the FD from binary images.\nThe original box-counting method consists of partitioning the structure space with a three-dimensional fixed grid of boxes of equal size r. The box sizes correspond to powers of 2, ranging in our case from 0 to 4 23. In fractal structures, the number N r of nonempty boxes of size r needed to cover the fractal structure depends on r according to the following equation:\nThe box-counting algorithm hence counts the number N r for different values of r and plots the log of the value N r versus the log of the box size r. The value of FD is then estimated from the slope of least squares best fitting curve:\nIn practical applications, when studying objects that are not pure fractals, the limit lim r0 is not attainable. Instead, N r is measured for a limited range of r values corresponding to intermediate resolutions of the object under study. Here a dilation algorithm was implemented using a 3D convolution. The voxel dilation method replaces each voxel in the white matter surface by a cube with size r. This provides a more precise version than the original box-counting algorithm. Subsequently, FD is then estimated by approximating Eq. ( 2).",

      "text": "Sixty-five flutemetamol images (23 pAD and 24 HV, nine pMCI and nine sMCI) and 281 florbetapir images (36 pAD and 82 HV, 134 sMCI and 29 pMCI) were used for this study.\nFirstly, we applied the hysteresis segmentation to the unprocessed PET images. The threshold values t 1 and t 2 (between 0 and 1) were set empirically to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. Three-dimensional six-connected neighborhoods were searched from each object voxel. Binary erosion was applied to the segmented binary image to extract the surface, using a cube structuring element with size 3. After this step, box counting and SE were applied to the white matter binary image (surface) and white matter original intensity image (volume), respectively.\nSecondly, SUVr in each of four lobes (frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe) were calculated from the co-registered PET images using the Montreal Neurological Institute atlas. The reference region for SUVr computation was the cerebellum. The resulting SUVr values from all lobes were fed to a SVM classifier to make a decision for pAD and HV, pMCI and sMCI.\nFinally, FD, SE and MRI features (hippocampus volume, lateral ventricle volume and cortical thickness generated from standard FreeSurfer pipeline) were then combined with SUVr 26. Due to the limited number of flutemetamol images, a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed for these data sets: one patient was taken as a test set and the remaining as training set, and this process was repeated 65 times. For each of the leaveone-out experiments, a three-fold cross-validation was used on the 64 patients in the training set to find the optimal parameters C and γ for the nonlinear support vector machine with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel. The resulting classifier was then used on the single testing set.\nThe florbetapir set was larger (n  281) and thus we chose to perform 10-fold cross-validation on it. Two hundred and fifty-three participants were taken as training set and the remaining 28 patients as test set. Three-fold crossvalidation was applied within the training set to find the optimal parameters as before.\nIn this study, PET and MRI features were computed from all 65 flutemetamol images and 281 florbetapir images. Both PET and MRI features were combined with SUVr to predict HV and pAD, pMCI and sMCI. The classification results were compared with BIE and most recent results from literature. In all cases, the gold standard for pAD classification was clinical diagnosis, and for MCI progression was 2-year follow-up.",

    "Discussion and conclusion": {
      "text": "In this paper two complexity measurements were proposed for amyloid status classification, namely FD and SE methods. Both FD and SE outperformed the traditional SUVr, both for the identification of pAD versus HVs and for identification of patients likely to convert from MCI to pAD. Individual application of FD and SE improved on the individual application of SUVr. When FD and SE were combined, an additional modest improvement was observed, suggesting some complementarity of the information from each. The best results for PET-only classification were obtained when SUVr, FD and SE were combined together. As an additional advantage, in our framework, FD and SE are calculated directly on the images on a straightforward manner, while SUVr was parcellated into four lobes with the help of an external atlas.\nThe SVM classification results indicated the ability of using 18 F PET features alone, and also pointed out the importance of introducing MR features, which resulted in a marked increase of the accuracy when compared to PET-only calculation in both the flutemetamol and florbetapir groups. However, these clearly introduced some information complementary from that in the PET as shown in the fact that the combination between MRI, FD, SE and SUVr (calculated on a lobar basis) resulted in the best classification overall. Results were competitive with existing literature, particularly on the prediction of MCI conversion.",

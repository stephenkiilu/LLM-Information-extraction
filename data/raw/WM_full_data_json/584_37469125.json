    "abstract": "Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments and motor symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers have been investigated as potential tools for detecting and monitoring memory-related impairment in ALS. Our objective was to examine the importance of identifying MRI biomarkers for memory-related impairment in ALS, motor neuron disease (MND), and ALS frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (ALS-FTD) patients. Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched. Keywords covering magnetic resonance imaging, ALS, MND, and memory impairments were searched. There were a total of 25 studies included in our work here. Results: The structural MRI (sMRI) studies reported gray matter (GM) atrophy in the regions associated with memory processing, such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus (PhG), in ALS patients. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies showed white matter (WM) alterations in the corticospinal tract (CST) and other tracts that are related to motor and extra-motor functions, and these alterations were associated with memory and executive function impairments in ALS. The functional MRI (fMRI) studies also demonstrated an altered activation in the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and other brain regions involved in memory and emotional processing in ALS patients. Conclusion: MRI biomarkers show promise in uncovering the neural mechanisms of memory-related impairment in ALS. Nonetheless, addressing challenges such as sample sizes, imaging protocols, and longitudinal studies is crucial for future research. Ultimately, MRI biomarkers have the potential to be a tool for detecting and monitoring memory-related impairments in ALS.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable diagnostic tool for several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6). MRI is a noninvasive technique that can detect brain changes, making it promising for identifying cognitive impairment biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (7)(8)(9). ALS is an NDD that primarily affects the motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) (10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18). ALS affects both motor and cognitive functions, ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to severe dementia, especially in ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) overlap syndrome (11,(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24). ALS-FTD can cause personality changes, language difficulties, memory impairment, and executive function problems that affect non-motor regions (11,22,25). According to the latest research, up to 50 of ALS patients have mild to moderate cognitive andor behavioral impairment (24,(26)(27)(28)(29). Approximately 30 of ALS patients have cognitive impairments, and 8-15 have significant behavioral changes linked to the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (25,30,31).\nAlong with motor symptoms, memory-related impairments are also observed in ALS patients (32)(33)(34). Identifying biomarkers for memoryrelated impairment in ALS patients is crucial for improving their quality of life and developing effective treatments (35). Recent studies have utilized MRI techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (36), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (5), and functional MRI (fMRI) to examine memory-related impairments in ALS and corresponding changes in the CNS (36,37).\nALS is associated with memory problems, particularly in episodic and working memory (38)(39)(40)(41)(42)(43) (Figure 1). Memory impairment in ALS can affect various types of memory and its prevalence varies among patients (38). It may be a primary deficit or a secondary effect of executive dysfunction, depression, or reduced attention. The complex neuropathology underlying memory deficits involves mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and genetic mutations (44,45). These processes can lead to hippocampal dysfunction and neuronal loss in connected brain regions (46). Propagation of pathological protein aggregates, such as TDP-43, from the motor cortex to other brain regions may also contribute (47).\nThe hippocampus is important for memory processes, but ALS can affect it in different ways, leading to memory impairment and cognitive decline (21). Christidi et al. conducted a systematic review of hippocampal pathology in ALS, emphasizing the need for structure-specific cognitive and neuroimaging tools to evaluate changes in the hippocampus (48). The extent and nature of hippocampal dysfunction in ALS vary among patients, reflecting the diseases heterogeneity (49,50).\nMRI biomarkers can aid in diagnosing and monitoring memory loss in ALS patients, providing insights into the mechanisms and developing targeted treatments (35,51). Identifying biomarkers can predict disease progression and treatment response, improving outcomes for ALS patients with common memory-related impairment (1,4,35,36,(52)(53)(54). This study aims to emphasize the importance of identifying MRI biomarkers for memory-related impairment in motor neuron disease (MND) and ALS patients, for improving their quality of life, treatments, and predicting disease progression.",

      "text": "3.2.1. Gray matter findings. In ALS, a degenerative disease affecting both motor and non-motor systems, cognitive impairments such as memory have been linked to gray matter (GM) changes in various brain regions. Volumetric MRI studies have consistently revealed hippocampal atrophy, with bilateral right hippocampus volume reductions associated with learning, memory, and recognition impairments (17,70). Further, the involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus (PhG) in cognitive dysfunction has been demonstrated, with thinning related to lower learning ability and memory performance-dependent atrophy (17).\nMesial temporal lobe dysfunction, affecting the hippocampus and amygdala, has been implicated (75). Moreover, distinctive atrophy patterns have been observed in the amygdala of ALS patients without cognitive and behavioral impairment (ALSni) and in the hippocampus of those with cognitive impairment (ALSci) compared to controls (54), but accumbens nucleus volumes were adversely associated with apathetic scores (51). Prefrontal atrophy has also been reported, with modestly decreased storing skills found in working memory tests but entirely intact filtering (34).",

These reductions are linked to cognitive profiles of executive and memory failure. Additionally, cortical thinning has been noted in bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, with lower MRI cortical thickness in the left prefrontal and parietal regions associated with improved recognition sorting test performance (72).",
      "subsections": {}
    },
    "DTI findings": {
      "text": "According to the DTI findings, there is a significant relationship between alterations in white matter integrity and memory deficits in ALS patients. Many studies reported significant associations between white matter alterations and memory deficits in ALS patients, particularly in the middle cerebellar peduncles, hippocampus, frontotemporal white matter pathways, and thalamocortical circuits (21,62,65,69). The DTI measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) In patients with the C9orf72 mutation, lower FA values were observed in the inferior and orbitofrontal cortical regions, which correlated with poor performance in verbal fluency and nonverbal memory tests (58). Microstructural changes in the hippocampus and frontotemporal white matter pathways affect the memory profiles of ALS patients. Changes in the left prefrontal pathway zone and the left uncinate fasciculus (UF) contribute to list-learning and prose memory, with AD and RD diffusivity measurements more strongly associated with memory performance (65).\nThe 2019 study by Trojsi et al. found that DTI measurements may serve as biomarkers for cognitive impairment in ALS patients. Negative relationships were found between isolated memory subscores and MDRD measurements in the left mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the corpus callosums genu, anterior body, and splenium. Verbal fluency scores were substantially linked with FA in various extra-motor white matter regions in the left hemisphere. Both subtotal and isolated memory scores were significantly associated with AD and RDMD in the left thalamus and the CC. These findings suggest that early extra-motor white matter problems may exist in ALS patients without cognitive impairment. The ALS nonspecific total score, which assesses memory and visuospatial cognitive domains, was inversely linked to an increase in AD in the left thalamus, mostly associated with axonal damage. The left mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus was linked to many DTI measures as well as cognitive scores, likely due to its function as a higher order thalamic relay that contributes to interaction across association cortexes through cortical-thalamocortical connections (62). In addition to the DTI measurements, another study by Chipika et al. examined the volumetric profile of specific thalamic nuclei that act as relay circuits between different cortical regions in ALS patients. They found that C9orf72 negative ALS patients and PLS patients exhibited reduced volumes of the ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei, which are involved in motor functions, and the mediodorsal-paratenial-reuniens nuclei, which are involved in memory and executive functions. These findings suggest that thalamus relayed circuits are selectively impaired in different phenotypes of ALS and that evaluating individual thalamic nuclei may provide more sensitive biomarkers than overall thalamic changes (62,65,78).\nThe association between WM tract degradation and cognitive impairments in ALS was reported in various studies, with alterations in interhemispheric and long-range corticocortical association networks being linked to executive function and memory test performance (73). Memory problems were linked to morphological changes in the hippocampi and were strongly linked to FA levels in the PhG (64). Memory performance was related to increased WM FA and reduced MD in the hippocampus region of the left cingulum bundle. The MD of the left cingulum bundle was likewise connected to memory performance (63).\nSome studies suggested a phased progression of cognitive impairment in ALS, with memory problems appearing later in the diseases progression, concurrent with hippocampal and medial temporal lobe alterations (67).",

    "fMRI findings": {
      "text": "3.4.1. Task-based fMRI findings. The fMRI studies investigating memory impairments in ALS patients utilized various cognitive tasks to probe different aspects of memory function. Patients exhibited compensatory brain activity during working memory tasks, with increased frontotemporal and parietal activation positively correlated with neuropsychological performance (57). In novelty processing tests, activation was observed in the fusiform and lingual gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus, with hippocampal hyperactivity potentially indicating compensatory processes (57). Over 40 of ALS patients exhibited cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function, with 14-21 showing memory deficits (68).\nDuring memory storage tasks, hemodynamic response function (HRF) responses in the prefrontal, occipital, and fusiform gyrus were decreased, but superior frontal areas were hyperactivated during filtering, suggesting that top-down control of posterior brain regions during memory storage has failed (63). Emotional decision and memory recognition tests revealed enhanced left hemisphere activation and reduced right hemisphere activity, implicating the PC gyrus in emotional and memory-related processes (74).\nIn language-related tasks, such as letter fluency and confrontation naming tests, ALS patients showed decreased activation in prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. Specifically, the confrontation-naming fMRI test demonstrated reduced activity in less widespread prefrontal areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus and the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes (77).",

Compensatory mechanisms, such as increased frontotemporal and parietal activity during working memory tasks, were observed, suggesting that the brain may adapt to ALS-related disruptions. Further research is required to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairments in ALS and to identify potential MRI biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and treatment response.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "ALS is an NDD (57). Cognitive and memoryrelated impairments are increasingly recognized as essential features of ALS. This study aimed to identify MRI biomarkers associated with memory impairment in ALS patients, using sMRI, DTI, and fMRI techniques. The study correlated MRI data with cognitive and behavioral tests to understand the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders and develop better diagnostic tools and treatments. The findings revealed significant structural and functional changes in brain regions associated with memory processing in ALS patients.\nSeveral other MRI biomarkers have been investigated in relation to memory-related impairment in ALS patients, including cortical thickness, GM volume (GMV), WMV, FC, FA, MD, AD, RD, etc (21,58,62,63,65,69,71,73,76). Biomarkers provide information about structural and functional changes in the brain linked to memory deficits in ALS patients. Cortical thickness and GMV changes in regions like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parietal cortex, and WM changes in regions like the CC, corticospinal tracts (CSTs), and anterior cingulate cortex are associated with memory deficits in ALS patients.\nThe study suggests that sMRI can detect memory-related changes in ALS, with structural damage observed in the Papez circuit (21,63), a neural network known to be involved in memory consolidation. Structural damage in the Papez circuit was linked to memory impairments in neurological disorders. Reduced GMV in the hippocampus further emphasizes the role of structural changes in memory deficits (57,59,61,63,64,(66)(67)(68)70). Previous research supports the current studys findings that sMRI can detect structural changes linked to memory impairment in ALS. Studies have linked right hippocampal atrophy to memory deficits, and memory performance-dependent atrophy of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus suggest the involvement of these regions in disease pathology (17). The study found that lower learning ability was related to thinning in the PhG, and the volume of the right and left hippocampus was associated with memory test performance (17).\nCortical atrophy in the bilateral frontal and cingulate cortex, left temporal gyrus, and right occipital gyrus is associated with verbal episodic memory (60). Thinning of the PhG is linked to poorer learning, and atrophy of the right orbital and anterior cingulate cortex is associated with verbal fluency and episodic memory impairment (17,60,77). Cortical atrophy in premotor regions linked to face, arm, and leg illustration is associated with performance on action knowledge assessments, contributing to semantic memory (75). MRI studies found atrophy in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex in ALS patients with memory impairment (63). In one study, vertexwise and volumetric differences were found between ALS patients with high and low memory performance, indicating the sensitivity of neuropsychological tests in detecting hippocampal pathology (61). Left entorhinal atrophy was linked to delayed recall and recognition, suggesting the Papez circuits general involvement in ALS (63).\nDTI revealed disrupted WM tracts in memoryrelated regions like the fornix and corpus callosum (CC) (21,62,69,73). DTI biomarkers studies have shown reduced FA in multiple regions (58,62,69) and WM tract disruption in important areas such as the frontal and temporal lobes (73,76). The disruption of these tracts suggests that impaired communication between brain regions may contribute to memory impairment. Reduced FA in disrupted WM tracts was linked to worse memory performance, supporting the role of WM abnormalities in memory deficits. Another study reported widespread WM alterations in ALS patients, focusing on the CSTs association with clinical features (73). CST alterations in ALS are linked to motor and cognitive symptoms, including weakness, spasticity, upper motor neuron involvement, and cognitive impairment in language and executive function. Other affected WM tracts include the CC and UF, associated with cognitive domains like memory, language, and executive function (61,62,65,69).\nDTI biomarkers have been correlated with cognitive performance in ALS patients, highlighting the link between WM integrity and cognitive impairment (58,69,71). Decreased FA in the UF and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus is linked to impairments in verbal fluency and naming ability (58,60,62), while decreased FA and increased MD, AD, or RD in the WM fiber tract integrity have been associated with poorer memory performance (69). These findings are in line with previous studies indicating that DTI can identify microstructural changes in WM tracts associated with cognitive and memory-related impairments in ALS (62,65,71,73). ALS patients with memory impairment demonstrated lower GMV in the hippocampus (17,63,66,68,70), insula (60), and cingulate cortex (60), as well as worse WM integrity in the fornix (73) and UF (65,69,71) when sMRI and DTI were combined. Reduced GMV in the hippocampus and insula was also linked to worse memory test results (70).\nALS affects both motor and non-motor systems, leading to cognitive abnormalities like memory impairment. sMRI and DTI studies show cortical and subcortical atrophy, involving the hippocampus, PhG, and mesial temporal lobe. Structural connectivity anomalies in the Papez circuit indicate extra-motor dysfunction. Atrophy and reduced WM integrity occur in several brain regions, suggesting broad involvement in cognitive impairment.\nwas used to explore the neural correlates of memory impairment in ALS patients, revealing altered neural activation patterns during memory tasks in individuals with neurological disorders (68,74,77). During working memory tasks, hyperactivity was observed in the frontotemporal and parietal regions in ALS patients, indicating compensatory mechanisms to overcome memory impairments (68). Reduced activation in prefrontal regions during memory storage tasks in ALS patients may suggest a breakdown in the top-down regulation of posterior brain areas, which is crucial for high-load memory tasks (37,77). Emotional decision and memory recognition tasks showed increased left hemisphere activation and decreased right hemisphere activation in ALS patients, indicating hemispheric lateralization in emotional and memory-related processes (74). Moreover, during memory storage, HRF responses are reduced in the prefrontal, occipital, and fusiform gyrus, while superior frontal regions are hyperactivated during filtering in ALS patients.\nFurthermore, advanced MRI techniques such as MRS (56,79), diffusion microstructure imaging (DMI) (80,81), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) (82) can provide additional information on the metabolic, microstructural, and hemodynamic aspects of hippocampal pathology in ALS. These techniques can complement the conventional MRI methods and enhance the detection and ALS monitoring of memory-related impairment in ALS. Recent research has found that patients with ALS exhibit higher levels of hippocampal total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), tNAAcreatine (tCr), and total choline (tCho) bilaterally, compared to healthy individuals. However, there were no significant differences in volumetric and perforant pathway zone (PPZ) diffusivity measures between the two groups. ALS patients with superior memory performance demonstrated higher levels of hippocampal tNAAtCr bilaterally, while those with longer symptom duration and greater functional disability exhibited higher tCho levels. These findings suggest that hippocampal 1H-MRS can serve as a sensitive biomarker for extra-motor disease burden in ALS and should be included in neuroimaging protocols for ALS patients (56).\nTo summarize, cognitive impairments in ALS are linked to microstructural changes in WM fiber tracts in both motor and extra-motor regions, including the middle cerebellar peduncles, thalamocortical circuits, and frontotemporal pathways. ALS affects multiple CNS areas associated with memory impairment, learning, verbal fluency, social cognition, and semantic memory, such as the hippocampus, PhG, mesial temporal lobe, frontal and cingulate cortex, left temporal gyrus, and right occipital gyrus. Anomalies in the structural connectivity of the Papez circuit and beyond may contribute to extra-motor dysfunction of a cortico-cerebellar loop substrate underlying memory changes in ALS. FA, MD, AD, and RD alterations were linked to verbal fluency, memory, and visuospatial abilities in ALS patients. Memory impairment was associated with anatomical changes in the hippocampal regions, left cingulum bundle, and perforantal pathway zone. Executive and memory tests correlated with WM fiber tract integrity changes in commissural and associative tracts. Extra-motor WMV loss was observed in executive and memory dysfunctions, and diffusivity abnormalities of the fornix and left uncinate were linked to poorer performance in memory and visuospatial tests, respectively.\nA hallmark of ALS pathology is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, including TAR DNAbinding protein 43 (TDP-43), in the cytoplasm of neurons (83)(84)(85). Misfolded proteins, including TDP-43, disrupt neuronal function and cause ALS. The Brettschneider staging system grades TDP-43 proteinopathy severity from 1 to 4 based on postmortem analysis, with higher stages indicating more severe disease (86)(87)(88)(89). TDP-43 protein accumulation in neurons is associated with ALS pathology, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The Brettschneider staging system assesses the severity of TDP-43 proteinopathy in ALS patients (90).\nPrior research has reported GM and WM atrophy in regions linked to memory processing in ALS patients using structural MRI. However, the relationship between these structural changes and the underlying molecular pathology of ALS remains unclear (17,37,63,64,91). The identification of MRI biomarkers that can detect and monitor the effects of TDP-43 pathology on brain structure and function is of great importance. Incorporating the gross, microscopic, and molecular pathology of ALS, such as TDP-43 and the Brettschneider pathological staging system, in future studies investigating MRI biomarkers for memory-related impairment in ALS patients is crucial (91)(92)(93)(94). The findings provide insights into neural mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in ALS, which may help in developing interventions to improve cognitive functioning in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range of clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the central nervous system leading to loss of brain function and eventual death. The most prevalent of these is Alzheimers disease (AD), which affects approximately 50 million people worldwide and is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative diseases can only be fully diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological assessment of the type and distribution of protein deposits which characterise each different condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in aiding patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these conditions for many years. In this review, we consider the range of MR-based measurements and describe the findings in AD, but also contrast these with the second most common dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The most definitive observation is the major structural brain changes seen in AD using conventional T1weighted (T1w) MRI, where medial temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most symptomatic patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings are sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in tissue microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter structures. There are suggestions that there are subtle differences between AD and DLB populations. At the metabolic level, atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of healthy neurons in brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to show higher deposits of pathogenic proteins. As studies have moved from patients with advanced disease and clear dysfunction to patients with earlier presentation such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some represents the first signs of their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to detect differences has been weaker and further work is still required, ideally in much larger cohorts than previously studied. The vast majority of imaging research in dementia populations has been univariate with respect to the MR-derived parameters considered. To date, none of these measurements has uniquely replicated the patterns of tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, and the ability of MR techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. Future opportunities may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches (position emission tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of structural and metabolic changes. Such developments will require multi-variate analyses, possibly combined with artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms, to enhance our ability to combine the array of imagederived information, genetic, gender and lifestyle factors.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The term neurodegenerative disease, like dementia, the other common description, is an umbrella term which covers a wide range of clinical conditions from the most common, Alzheimers disease, through motor neuron diseases to increasingly rare conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy. Collective to these conditions is the progressive degeneration of neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) which leads to loss of brain function and eventual death.\nNeurodegenerative diseases are one of the fastest growing conditions worldwide, with the number of people diagnosed with dementia worldwide being estimated at nearly 47 million individuals in 2016 1. In the general population, the most important risk factor for dementia is age and so, as life expectancy continues to increase, the number of individuals with a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative dementia is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030 and 131 million by 2050. Understanding the pathophysiology of the degenerative processes within the CNS is inherently limited by the inaccessibility of tissue in the living subject, and so the use of non-invasive measurement technologies such as MRI and MRS has long been a topic of interest.\nIn this review, we will focus on the group of most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, the dementias. We will give a brief overview of the most common forms and describe the current understanding regarding their neuropathology. We will then consider in depth the use of MR methods to study dementia, beginning with a historical perspective and continuing to consider what the latest state-of-the-art imaging studies have revealed.",

      "text": "The most common forms of dementia are Alzheimers disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and vascular dementia (VaD). In this review, we will consider the first two of these groups, as clinically these conditions manifest with overlapping symptoms and so one key driver for the use of imaging technologies is to aid differential diagnosis. AD is manifest with symptoms of memory impairment, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia and altered executive functioning (being the ability to plan and organise). The course of the disease is characterised by gradual onset of symptoms with a continuing cognitive decline. The clinical symptoms of DLB also feature progressive cognitive decline, but memory impairment is a less prominent feature. Instead core features include fluctuating levels of cognition and attention, recurrent visual hallucinations, parkinsonian symptoms (balance problems and rigid muscles), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder and autonomic system dysfunction 2,3.\nNeuropathologically, neurodegeneration is characterised by the accumulation and amalgamation of specific proteins within the cell bodies, axonal processes and the extracellular space which are toxic to nerve cells and lead to impaired cellular function and eventual cell death 4. Historically, different protein deposits have been associated with different types of dementia, but on detailed investigation it is clear that there is significant overlap in the cellular pathology between dementia types 4. It is also important to recognise that during life, patient diagnosis is made based on their clinical symptoms and a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease does not guarantee the neuropathological observations which will be found in the post-mortem brain. In practice, a range of histological findings and varying levels of these dementia-associated protein aggregates are found in the brain even in elderly subjects without dementia 4,5.\nAlzheimers disease is characterised by accumulated deposits of amyloid b protein (Ab) found in the extracellularinterstitial space and known as amyloid plaques. Deposits of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein are also observed within the neuronal cell bodies and their neuronal processes, referred to as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neuropil threads respectively. Finally, AD brains also contain neuritic plaques composed of both Ab and tau deposits and which are considered to be distinct from Ab plaques 6. For both Ab and NFT, neuropathology has revealed hierarchical sequences of spatial deposition throughout the brain 789 which are used to classify the disease severity (see Fig. 1). These spatial patterns are of direct interest for imaging researchers as target regions for specific measurements such as MR spectroscopy (MRS), or to evaluate whether imaging techniques can reflect these patterns as surrogates of the underlying histopathology. For Ab, Thal et al defined 5 spatial phases 7 beginning with limited deposits in neocortex (frontal, parietal, temporal, or occipital, Fig. 1, left, Stage I), progressing to medial temporal lobe (entorhinal region, hippocampus, insular cortex), amygdala and cingulate cortex, then to subcortical structures including deep gray matter structure (caudate, thalamus) and white matter and finally into brainstem and cerebellum (Fig. 1, left, Stage V). For NFT (Fig. 1, middle), Braak et al 8,9 described the progressive deposition from initially limited involvement in the transentorhinal cortex, through extensive transentorhinal involvement (including hippocampus), deposits in the limbic areas and insular cortex and then to widespread cortical involvement, particularly in occipital, temporal and parietal lobes 10.\nLewy body dementias have distinct neuropathology based on the observation of the protein a-synuclein which forms into spindle or thread like structures within the cellular processes, termed Lewy neurites (LNs), and as globular structures or Lewy bodies (LBs) in the neuronal cell bodies 11. The presence of LNs and LBs is accompanied by neuronal loss. The commonly used Braak staging applied to describe the distribution and severity of LNs and LBs 11 suggests that nuclei in the medulla oblongata are the first to be affected (Fig. 1, right, stage I), with pathology spreading gradually to pons (stage II), midbrain (stage III), entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (stage IV) and finally the neocortex (stages V and VI).\nIn sporadic cases of dementia (as distinct from dominantly inherited cases with underlying genetic mutations), the formation of the various insoluble protein aggregates was assumed to be cellautonomous, with many cells all independently developing their own local aggregates which eventually led to damage and death of those cells. However, in the past decade evidence has emerged that this is not necessarily the case and that aggregates of tau and a-syn can begin locally with formation of a pathological seed in a single or small number of cells which then propagates through the tissue. This process is likened to (but distinct from) prion diseases whereby the abnormal conformation of the proteins within the pathological seed can induce the same conformation changes in the protein within the local environment, and even spread from cell to cell 10,12,13. In the context of non-invasive imaging, the ability to track such a spread in the living subject is considered an important target as a putative outcome measure for clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "text": "The most common approach to follow the impact of neurodegenerative diseases by MRI is assessment of changes in regional and total brain volumes. As a result of the consistency of findings using MRI, the diagnostic criteria for AD include observation of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, which is clearly seen in patients with AD but is a much less common finding in DLB. Indeed the recently revised diagnostic criteria for DLB use relative preservation of the MTL structures on imaging as a supportive biomarker for DLB 3. Initial studies on the potential value of structural MRI to detect regional brain atrophy in dementia patients commenced almost as soon as the technique was clinically available. Alzheimers disease was well recognised from neuropathological studies and from imaging studies using CT 14 to show extensive medial temporal lobe atrophy, and this became the first target for MRI quantification. The pioneering MRI studies 151617 clearly revealed the expected pathology, demonstrating significant atrophy and allowed quantification, beginning with simple visual rating scores 17 and progressing to total hippocampal volume measurements made by manual delineation on individual scan slices 16. Measuring the global rate of tissue loss was suggested as a potentially potent marker of disease progression 18 and techniques such as the boundary shift integral 19 were introduced and applied in AD. Since those early studies in small cohorts, larger patient groups have been investigated 20 and structural imaging has become a key measure in important longitudinal studies such as the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, 21), now in its sec-ond decade and providing a rich data resource for dementia researchers 22. Given the scale of the challenge presented by the numbers of patients with neurodegenerative disease, imaging study group sizes, however, remain modest at typically 50-100 subjects.",

      "text": "As automated image analysis methodologies developed, pixelwise assessment became feasible. The detailed spatial patterns of atrophy have been extensively studied, using methods such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) within the statistical parametric mapping framework (SPM, 23) and surface-based methods such as Freesurfer ( 24). Findings between all analysis methods are largely consistent and depict the clear MTL loss seen by visual inspection 25, as well as more subtle and widespread bilateral cortical thinning throughout the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. These observations are illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows the results of comparing cortical thickness, derived from structural T1-weighted MRI scans between patients with AD and matched controls.. As the changes affect the grey matter, covering the surface of the brain, they are conveniently presented as colour overlays indicating signifcant differences projected onto a representative volume rendered view of the brain anatomy.\nIn patients with AD, greatest cortical loss is found in MTL, temporoparietal regions, posterior cingulate and precuneus 262728. As a potential test for differential diagnosis between dementia sub-types, a number of studies have compared atrophy patterns and rate of decline. A significant study in the comparison of AD and DLB is the work of Lebedev et al which applied classification software to cortical thickness data 29. Importantly that work included two independent patient cohorts which allowed classifications derived from one cohort to be tested in the other. The discriminatory features between AD and DLB were similar in both cohorts, with the most striking area being thinning of the temporal pole, but also including anterior parahippocampal, subgenual cingulate and occipital regions being important in classification as AD, and thinning of bilateral cingulate and superior temporooccipital cortex characterising DLB (Fig. 3a). Cross-validation between cohorts did not, however, provide consistent results, although this may be explained by differences in the scan acquisition parameters used between cohorts which could influence the precise quantitative cortical thickness measurements which form the core of the discriminant analysis. Interestingly, there is some overlap between these findings and the pattern of differences obtained by groupwise statistical analysis in a further larger cohort 27 (Fig. 3b). These data point towards the clear need for standardised acquisition approaches if such statistical approaches are to be used in routine diagnosis.\nWith the advent of higher magnetic field strength scanners, the MTL remains an important target for imaging assessment at increased spatial resolution. The hippocampus is composed of 6 layers 30 and studies at 1.5 T had suggested that elements of the layered structure could be visualised using MRI, but the clarity of layers was variable due to the available signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the sub-millimetre resolution required 31. Work at 3 T subsequently showed significant improvements due to the higher SNR, achieving greater spatial resolution, and possible contrast differences from B 0 -derived differences in relaxivity, with the main visible feature being a dark band on T2-weighted imaging arising from the stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum and stratum moleculare (SRLM) 32. Human studies at 7 Tesla have again shown that improved SNR achieves greater reliability in visualisation of the main substructures 33,34, and at highest resolution begin to show finer details such as the dentate gyrus cell layer at only 0.1 mm in thickness 35. However, the long duration of the scan and subject motion on a scale commensurate to or often greater than the size of the structures of interest hamper routine use of these techniques in clinical populations. Fig. 2. Analysis of volumetric images show regional cortical atrophy in patients with Alzheimers disease (upper panel) and in Dementia with Lewy bodies (lower panel) versus matched healthy subjects. In each panel the four images represent the surface rendered views of the brain looking at the outer surface of left and right hemispheres (upper pairs) and the medial surfaces of each hemisphere (lower pairs). Anatomical, isotropic resolution T1-weighted MRI scans were analysed using the Freesurfer 24 software approach. A dense mesh of vertices are defined over the outer surface of the grey matter (at the grey matter to CSF boundary) and the inner surface (at the grey to white matter boundary). The thickness of the cortex (grey matter) is then measured as the separation between these two surfaces at every point over the entire brain surface. Groupwise statistical comparison is then made been the cortical thickness at every vertex point. Statistically significant differences are colour coded according p value, with hotter colours indicating greater differences and overlaid on the surface rendered anatomical view of the brain. In these examples all areas show where patients have lost grey matter and hence have thinner cortex than age-and gender-matched healthy controls.

It was of interest that, in addition to loss of regional tissue volumes, there was a disease-driven disappearance of the SRLM band in these images, which mirrors neuropathological studies which reported this layer as one of the earliest affected by AD pathology 8. When the visual clarity of the layer on 3 T MRI was classified by a simple rating score, it was found to be significantly less pronounced in patients with AD and more preserved in patients with DLB 32 (Fig. 4). In patients with DLB there was also a relationship between clarity of the SRLM and performance on tests of delayed recall. Similarly, a contemporaneous study at 7 T demonstrated quantita-tive measures of the layer thickness, showing reductions in individuals with AD 34. Subsequent studies harnessing the greater image quality at 7 T have repeated these observations 36, and others have demonstrated a functional consequence of the loss of the SRLM with highly significant relationships to performance on memory testing in patients with AD 37.\nThe hippocampus is highly interconnected to other brain regions and so the consequence of structural loss is potentially important in understanding clinical dysfunction. It was also interesting that when the visual clarity of the SRLM was used as regressor to explain variability in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, see Section 3.2) analysis of the white matter in the same subjects, highly significant associations were found between loss of the ). This layer was found to be significantly reduced in patients with AD 32.Images in panel (a) reprinted from 32 with permission from IOS Press.

A larger study in AD confirmed this finding, reporting reduced white matter integrity on diffusion imaging associated with regional hippocampal atrophy 39. Volumetric MRI has established widely accepted whole brain rates of atrophy in the healthy older subjects (0.6 per year), together with demonstrating higher rates of atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment (1.1 per year) who are at risk of progressing to Alzheimers disease. In patients with AD itself the rate is higher still (with typical reports suggesting figures of 1.5 per year 22, however the rate is highly regional and tissue loss in the hippocampus occurs at a greater rate than elsewhere in the brain (1.4 vs 4.6 per year in healthy controls and AD patients respectively) 40. These rates represent average values across patient cohorts, but atrophy rate itself is now known to increase during disease progression 41,42, accelerating tissue loss in later stages. Dissecting the role of hippocampal sub-fields has become the next target to enhance our understanding of disease progression and extend the role for structural imaging in clinical trials, and is an area where the power of 7 T MRI will be critical. Combining improved clinical assessment of disease heterogeneity within the overarching classification of AD 43 or DLB 44 with advanced image analysis and large cohort datasets will further improve the diagnostic value of structural MRI 45.",

    "Diffusion measurements": {
      "text": "While conventional T1w structural MRI has provided the means to measure total brain tissue loss and cortical atrophy, the field has turned to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the white matter tracts.\nDiffusion tensor imaging quantifies the directionality and overall restriction of the self-diffusion of water molecules within the tissue. In the clinical setting, diffusion imaging sequences are based on the Stejskal-Tanner pulsed gradient spin-echo approach 46. Gradient performance characteristics mean that sequence diffusion times are always tens of milliseconds in duration, which in unrestricted conditions would lead to mean free diffusion distances of 10 lm, compared to the axonal dimension of 0.5 lm 47. Consequently, clinical measurement of brain tissue water diffusion is always in a highly restricted regime. Using only 3 orthogonal diffusion measurement directions the overall diffusivity can be estimated independent of underlying microstructure orientation via the trace of the diffusion tensor, which is theoretically invariant to the selection of measurement axes. This approximation was used in early diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) studies to measure changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). However, in the white matter, diffusion is strongly orientation dependent, following the major white matter tracts. Detailed analysis of the diffusion tensor provides additional key metrics to assess the integrity of the white matter microstructure, with the most commonly applied being mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and the main diffusion components (axial and radial diffusivities, AxD and RD respectively derived from the principle diffusion eigenvalues). In the simplest terms, degenerative damage to axonal structure is hypothesised to increase MD and reduce FA, with changes in the radial component (RD) being attributed to loss of myelin.\nThere are again clear commonalities across the many hundreds of studies that have been conducted using DTI in patients with Alzheimers disease. Early studies investigated small patient groups using DWI with manually selected regions of interest distributed throughout important white matter structures. Kantarci et al reported that the ADC was elevated throughout the brain in AD 48. Similarly using the more elaborate DTI methods MD was reported to be increased in most sampled areas, while FA was decreased 49,50. Larger cohort studies using ROI-based methodology replicated these initial findings 51. The surge in interest in DTI for neurological imaging was again followed by more advanced analysis methods to examine spatial distributions using SPM but also DTI specific approaches, particularly the Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS, 52) method which restricts analysis to only the most reliable white matter skeleton at the centre of the tracts. Regional variation in FA was mapped and provided the most detailed view, again highlighting that reduced FA encompasses the vast majority of the white matter tracts in patients with AD 53,54. A meta-analysis conducted in 2011 details the consensus, that MD increases across all brain regions in AD, while FA is reduced in all regions except parietal white matter and internal capsule 55. Illustrative diffusion findings in dementia groups are shown in (Fig. 5) which depicts areas of significantly reduced MD (red-orange regions) and areas of significantly decreased FA (blue regions). To understand the neurobiological substrate for these changes requires comparison of imaging metrics with the underlying pathology, which is infrequently possible. The limited imaging and histological studies in post-mortem brain have, however, shown that reduced FA in the AD brain primarily results from axonal loss 56.\nAn essential consideration for all neuroimaging techniques is their potential to aid in diagnosis. In this context, important studies have examined the differences between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early and late disease AD subjects compared to matched controls. MCI is a disorder characterised by cognitive impairment, learning difficulties, and reduced ability to concentrate when assessed by formal investigation, but with symptoms which are insufficient for a diagnosis of dementia. MCI patients can be sub-divided into those with (amnestic MCI) and without (non-amnestic MCI) memory impairment. Amnestic MCI may be one of the earliest signs of AD and hence predicting which patients will progress to AD is important for clinical management and will have increasing value as new therapeutic strategies for AD become available. A large number of studies continue to be conducted in these patient populations but data are not always consistent. Key white matter tracts of interest are the splenium of the corpus callosum and the cingulum. Zhang et al reported graded reduction in the cingulum FA, being lower in MCI than controls and more so in AD, while FA was reduced in the splenium in AD, but not in MCI, suggesting measurements in these brain areas may offer potential for differential diagnosis 57. FA values were also reported by others to be reduced in the fornix and splenium in AD compared with either MCI or healthy controls 58; however a subsequent study reported decreased posterior cingulate FA in both amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD compared to controls, but no difference between aMCI and AD 59. While the data in this area continue to grow, the 2011 meta-analysis 55 suggested that the splenium and posterior cingulum were important regions in the MCI group but show significantly higher variability in MCI compared to AD patients, possibly due to heterogeneity of the MCI patient group associated with the weaker diagnostic criteria for MCI.\nDTI clearly demonstrates disease-related differences between patients with AD, MCI and matched controls. As described in Section 2, the neuropathology of dementia varies between AD and DLB, so it is reasonable to ask whether DTI reveals any microstructural differences between patients with different dementia diagnoses, and hence whether DTI could provide a future method for differential diagnosis. Comparing groups of patients with either AD or DLB against control subjects revealed areas of reduced FA in both cohorts, which in DLB was predominantly in the parietooccipital white matter tracts, with relative sparing of the frontal areas (Fig. 5). In AD, however, widespread reduction in FA was seen, including the white matter tracts of the frontal lobes 60. Similarly, comparing patients with DLB against those with Parkinsons Disease Dementia (PDD), a posterior dominance for reduced FA was found in DLB 61. This posterior dominance in DLB is interesting given the core diagnostic feature of recurrent visual hallucinations, suggesting abnormalities of the visual network. Indeed tract-based analyses of the visual association pathways have identified reduced FA in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus 62,63. Therefore, beyond group differences based on essential diagnosis, there is evidence of strong relationships between the cognitive symptoms and the white matter changes in tracts which are associated with known networks 60.\nMuch of the DTI-based research in dementia cohorts has been cross-sectional in nature with longitudinal studies fewer in number. Understanding the potential of DTI to monitor disease progression is a further important consideration. As new interventions become available, there is a clear need for sensitive outcome measures which can detect slowing of progression to aid in clinical trials. Data are however rather variable, with studies in small groups of subjects. In some cohorts, MD has been noted to increase over a 1 year period while FA has been unchanged 58,64, whereas others have reported FA to decline 65 and become more widespread with time 66. While the cognitive impairment (mini mental state examination, MMSE) scores are similar across these studies, the AD cohorts differ in age, which may then explain these differences. In DLB patients, a 1 year longitudinal study found groupwise differences compared to control subjects but did not find any significant differences over time in FA or MD in patients, suggesting that white matter degeneration may be a relatively early feature of DLB 64. It is clear that more detailed work is required to characterise any longitudinal differences in DTI.\nA further factor which we have not so far considered but which will undoubtedly impact on the diagnostic use of DTI in the individual patient is the influence of the genetic background on both their risk factor for dementia and on the imaging-derived metrics. The strongest genetic association with dementia risk in the general population is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) status of the individual.\nThere are 3 major alleles of the APOE gene (e2, e3 and e4), and individuals who carry the e4 variant have higher risk for sporadic AD then individuals without the e4 variant. In 2006, Perrson et al reported the differences in brain diffusion metrics between healthy older subjects who were matched for age, gender, education and cognitive performance but differed between e3 and e4 status. They observed that FA was reduced in e4 carriers in the splenium and the left hippocampus 67, both areas where patient studies in AD had found significant differences relative to control subjects. Further studies exploring the association between genotype and FA have also reported reduced FA in left parahippocampal gyrus white matter 68 and a strong (but not statistically significant) FA reduction in the posterior cingulum 69 in e4 carriers. A further study spanning cohorts from multiple research centres also observed reduced FA in the cingulum in older e4 carriers, with further differences in the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, internal and external capsule 70. Additionally, gender has also been identified as a factor which influences white matter diffusion metrics 69, further confounding interpretation of much of the data in the AD literature.\nRecent work has considered how closely the DTI metric changes represent the pathological staging of disease. The constant challenge in attempting such work is the need for imaging assessments to be made during life (water diffusion properties change substantially post mortem), while the neuropathological comparison can Fig. 5. Findings from a tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) DTI study comparing patients with AD and DLB against matched controls. Individual brain diffusion datasets in each subject were registered to a standard template and the major white matter tracts (referred to as the white matter skeleton, shown in green overlaid on the anatomical template) throughout the brain were identified. Groupwise comparison of the diffusion derived metrics were then made between the patients and control group at every point in the white matter skeleton pixels. Statistically significant differences are then overlaid using a colourscale depicting the degree of significance. Upper panel: Statistically significant increases (p  0.05) in water mean diffusivity (MD) in patients compared to controls are seen throughout the white matter (red-orange pixels), with little to differentiate between AD and DLB patients. Lower panel: Statistically significant decreases (p  0.05) in water fractional anisotropy FA in patients compared to controls (blue pixels). While AD patients again show widespread differences throughout the white matter, the DLB group show predominance of changes in the posterior brain regions. The full report of this study is found in 60.\nonly be made post mortem. While diffusion studies have extensively described altered FA as markers of damaged axonal integrity, Kantarci et al 71 were unable to show voxelwise differences in FA between patient groups based on neurofibrillary tangle stage (Braak IV and VI, 9). However, voxelwise MD was increased in precuneus, fornix and cingulum. Adopting a region of interest approach to sample whole WM tracts did reveal significant associations between decreasing FA (and increasing MD) and Braak NFT staging in the ventral cingulum tract and precuneus white-matter 71. Thus while an association was present between imaging and neuropathology, disease progression cannot currently be visualised using DTI metrics.",

    "Relaxation time mapping measurements": {
      "text": "Quantitative MRI methodology has long focussed on mapping of relaxation times to seek subtle changes in tissue characteristics beyond those which can be discriminated by visual radiological review. In the context of relaxation time mapping in neurodegenerative diseases, the goals are typically to determine whether the changes in tissue characteristics, most specifically the presence of abnormal protein deposits in the tissue, can be detected through altered relaxivity. Transgenic animal models based on gene modification mimicking the familiar forms of dementia have provided a useful testbed for these hypotheses allowing direct correlation of in vivo imaging to neuropathology. A number of such studies in animal models with differing mutations leading to increased amyloid have shown altered T 1 and T 2 72,73. Reduction in tissue water T 2 is reported which may be related to increased iron deposition associated with amyloid plaques. T 1 is found to be strongly associated with normal age-related changes and tissue water content, but when these confounding factors are taken into account T 1 is decreased and has been reported to be significantly correlated to amyloid load. The co-localisation of amyloid and deposits of iron in amyloid rich cortex, however, make the mechanism for reduced T 1 relaxation time difficult to determine 72. Other studies at higher field 74, however, have not observed changes in T 1 , which may reflect alterations in relaxation behaviour due to the field dependence of T 1 or may reflect heterogeneity in observational methodology.\nRelaxation mapping studies in human subjects pose additional challenges due to the thin nature of the cortex and the proximity to CSF, with the potential for significant bias in T 1 estimates in the presence of partial volume effects. In patients with AD, T 1 was reported in the earliest studies to be significantly elevated across areas of the cortex 75 with the possibility that cortical atrophy was a contributing factor given the large pixel size. Recently we have used voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) to follow longitudinal changes in cortical and subcortical grey matter 76 in patients with AD (Fig. 6, in the same cohort for whom volumetric 28 (Fig. 2) and DTI findings were previously reported 60 (Fig. 5). With registration of datasets over time and exclusion of voxels with partial volume effects from CSF and atrophy, we observed reduced T 1 values in temporal lobe cortex in AD compared to control subjects, which tended to increase particularly in the hippocampus over a 1-year interval, and where this increase was strongly correlated to decline in cognitive performance on MMSE. The fact that quantitative relaxometric methods can yield additional information is further underlined by a recent innovative study in cognitively intact subjects with enhanced risk factors for AD (APOE) which investigated the association between white matter T 1 and T 2, myelin water fraction (a further quantitative MR approach) and CSF biomarkers including phosphorylated tau and b-amyloid 77. Extensive correlations were reported between all imaging measures and CSF biomarkers, suggesting that amyloid pathology significantly impacts on the properties of white matter and may be an early feature of AD. Future work seems warranted by these observations.\nIn humans there is an-age related decline in T 2 within the hippocampus with a further significant shortening of T 2 in patients with AD compared to age-matched controls 78,79. Other work has suggested that reduced T 2 correlates with clinical decline (MMSE) in AD 80, which was supported by our own findings using voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) in a larger cohort of AD patients, where again significant reduction in T 2 was observed in bilateral hippocampus 76 (Fig. 6). Interestingly our observed changes in T 2 were much more restricted than the areas of reduced T 1 , indicating a potentially different mechanism. It should be noted, however, that reduced T 2 relaxation times are not found ubiquitously, with some authors reporting no changes 81. One explanation for these discrepancies is methodological bias, Fig. 6. Voxel-based relaxometry data comparing changes in cortical relaxation times in patients with Alzheimers disease versus a matched control group. Coloured areas indicated areas with altered relaxation times in patients. In this study, image data were acquired to quantify the tissue relaxation times T 1 and T 2 and generate pixelwise relaxation maps. Each map was segmented into the basic tissue classes of grey matter, white matter and CSF and these were spatially transformed to match a standard brain template. Relaxation values were compared at each point in the grey matter comparing the group of AD subjects with matched controls to identify tissue where there were significant alterations in relaxation time in the AD group.

However, the fact that a number of studies, including unbiased VBR analysis, have independently demonstrated the same areas of altered relaxation lends weight to these findings.\nTo determine whether there are neurodegeneration-driven changes in relaxation times in human brain and precisely how they relate to the neuropathology requires correlation to post-mortem histology. Data from the animal models already described suggest that iron is the most likely mechanism. Detailed histological and histopathological analysis of human tissue has shown that T 2 is reduced in the AD brain associated with increased iron 82 which accumulates in activated microglia and in myelin in the middle cortical layers in the AD brain and is correlated with the Braak staging 83. These observations fuel the potential for clinical non-invasive measurements of AD-associated neuropathology by MRI. However, while high resolution imaging of fixed specimens does demonstrate the association of increased iron with elevated cortical Ab, the data do not show one-to-one correspondence between plaques, iron and imaging changes 84. Using microimaging correlated to histology and chelation techniques to strip iron from the tissue samples, Meadowcroft et al showed that the change in R 2  (1T 2 ) in areas of b-amyloid is not solely due to co-localised iron, as R 2  remained elevated after iron was removed 85. A larger study comparing early and late onset AD with control tissue also reported that reduced cortical T 2  was associated with a mix of elevated iron levels and abnormal cortical myelin architecture, with limited impact of amyloid or tau 86. Recently a largescale study has been conducted using post-mortem brain hemispheres with MRI in 567 brains, including 210 subjects diagnosed with AD 87. That study performed pixelwise regression analysis of tissue R 2 values against potential explanatory factors including demographics, AD pathology and other histology. The majority of change was found in the white matter where R 2 was slower (longer T 2 ), with only a small area of insular cortex showing elevated R 2 (shorter T 2 ).\nIt is therefore clear that subtle changes in relaxation behaviour are present throughout the brain in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Simple relaxation mapping can reveal the spatial distributions but mechanisms are multifactorial. More complex analysis methods which attempt to model the various biophysical factors that simultaneously influence relaxation may be a way to further the use of quantitative relaxometry 88.",

      "text": "While the MR methodologies discussed so far provide unique information on brain tissue structure and function, MRI can also quantify physiological parameters such as cerebral perfusion. In this area though, MRI has a number of long established competitor techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI approaches should, however, be considered here as they benefit significantly from the ability to correct for atrophy using the volumetric scans acquired at the same imaging investigation and provide a nonionising alternative scan methodology.\nThe predominant research MRI method for quantitative assessment of cerebral perfusion is the arterial spin labelling (ASL) approach 89. ASL methods are many, but are grouped into three main families -pulsed, continuous and pseudo-continuous methods -defining how the inflowing magnetization is labelled (typically by magnetization inversion) for subsequent detection in the imaging plane. All ASL methods in routine research rely on image differencing between perfusion encoded and control scan collections to reveal the inflowing magnetization. Here we will only briefly summarise the findings with ASL as these typically mirror what was already known to occur in neurodegeneration from SPECT and PET scanning, but we will also consider the comparison of these methodologies.\nThe benchmark findings in patients with AD using nuclear medicine methods such as PET cerebral blood flow (CBF) or metabolic studies by fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) are primarily hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in temporoparietal association cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and frontal lobe 90. The abnormalities progress with disease development, with the cingulate gyri and temporoparietal cortices being first affected in milder AD and with frontal hypoperfusion seen with more advanced disease. Comparison of patients with AD against DLB reveals occipital hypometabolismhypoperfusion as a key diagnostic feature of DLB; on sagittal midline view there is sparing of the posterior cingulate relative to the cuneus and precuneus which is visually described as the cingulate island sign 91.\nEarly investigations by ASL were performed in isolation from other nuclear medicine techniques and reported spatial distributions which compared favourably with PET and SPECT in patients with AD  92 93,94 (Fig. 7). Formal comparison of ASL with nuclear medicine techniques has followed in studies where patients have undergone multi-modality investigation. Chen et al demonstrated a clear voxelwise synergy between regions of hypo-perfusion on ASL and areas of hypometabolism on FDG-PET 95. That work was supported by the similar findings of Musiek et al 96 who also considered the diagnostic value of ASL versus PET and concluded that both techniques were similar in performance based on Fig. 7.

Investigations using ASL in DLB again replicate expected patterns of hypoperfusion 97,98.\nA significant advantage of the MRI-based methods is the inherent ability to combine the CBF data with high quality structural MRI. When the partial volume error arising from cortical atrophy is measured from T1w scans and used to correct the blood flow data, the AD brain still shows clear hypoperfusion in the inferior parietal lobe, bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and middle frontal gyri 99,100. Extending the studies to patients with MCI has suggested some areas of hyperperfusion, particularly in hippocampus, amygdala and deep gray matter structures 101, but this has not been supported by larger more recent studies 102. With the widespread availability of ASL methods compared to traditional nuclear medicine approaches, MRI-based studies have also begun to dissect the genetic factors associated with variations in CBF.\nHere there is a suggestion that APOE4 carriers show areas of elevated perfusion in areas of central importance in AD pathology such as parahippampal gyrus; however opposing lateralisation has been reported between different studies, perhaps reflecting low statistical power in the analysis 103,104.\nIn addition to blood flow, ASL methods can also measure other hemodynamic factors. Mak et al demonstrated the expected patterns of reduced CBF in AD patients using the QUASAR-ASL approach, but also demonstrated that the positive correlation between reduced cognitive function (MMSE) and hypoperfusion was mirrored by an inverse correlation with arterial transit time in the same brain regions 100. The MRI-based methods suggest that the perfusion deficits reflect vascular changes within the remaining cortex in the AD.\nIn summary then, the non-invasive nature of the ASL measurements and the additional quantitative and vascular information which can be extracted, coupled with the increasing availability of commercial ASL methods from scanner vendors, make the use of ASL in AD an attractive alternative to FDG-PET.",

    "Basic CNS spectroscopy -A brief review": {
      "text": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has long been promoted as a method to visualise metabolic changes in tissue, which may present the earliest detectable sign of neurodegeneration before structural change and atrophy can be observed. Proton MRS has been used extensively over the past two decades to study neurodegenerative conditions, particularly AD, with more recent studies considering MCI and DLB. To understand the potential role for MRS requires review of the information contained in the MR spectrum. The key features of the proton MR spectrum from human brain (Fig. 8a) are the 4 main peaks from N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cre), choline (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI), with smaller less easily quantified signals from glutamate  glutamine (Glx) and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). In the context of neurodegeneration, NAA has received the most attention as it is considered a marker of neuro-axonal viability or, more generally, of neuronal density 105. This assignment is based on the known neuronal localisation 106 and its relationship to ATP synthesis 107. The precise metabolic function of NAA remains elusive but it also plays a role in osmotic regulation and cell signallingneurotransmission 108. The creatine signal (Cre) combines free creatine and phosphocreatine which are relatively ubiquitous throughout the cells of the CNS. For this reason Cre is often considered as relatively inert to tissue injury and historically many studies report metabolite levels as a ratio to creatine, assuming it is a stable internal concentration reference. The choline (Cho) peak combines signals arising from multiple sources including free choline, phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphocholine 109, which all have membrane-related roles. Changes, most often increases, in the Cho peak are therefore normally attributed to membrane degradation. Myo-Inositol (mI) is known to be largely astrocytic in localisation 110 so is considered a marker of glial cell density in tissue, although since it also functions to provide osmotic balance 111, changes may also reflect stress of cell volume regulation processes.",

    "Early observations by MRS": {
      "text": "The low sensitivity of MRS and need to avoid signals from lipids in the skull and scalp have typically required pre-selection of single volumes of interest or voxel grids of limited extent from which the spectra are acquired, trading away much knowledge of spatial variation in return for metabolic detail. Research applications of MRS in dementia are, however, extensive and consequently studies have sampled a wide range of anatomical areas. (The relevant literature has been reviewed elsewhere in detail 112). There is a pervasive finding that NAA is reduced in patients with AD in the majority of grey matter regions which have been investigated. Myo-inositol is generally found to be elevated while Cho and Cre -(where separately and externally quantified) are unchanged. This pattern of findings has been reported in temporal lobe 113114115116, medial temporal lobe 117, posterior cingulate 113,115,118119120, cuneusprecuneus 121, centrum semi-ovale 122 and frontal white matter 114. Exceptions to the finding of reduced NAA in AD are studies of occipital lobe 113, fronto-parietal cortical surface 117 and frontal grey matter voxels where NAA is reported as normal in AD 115. These metabolic changes have been associated with clinical status with elevated mI inversely correlating to MMSE 114 and reduced NAA correlating with MMSE 117. It must be noted for completeness that a small number of studies have failed to find any metabolic changes in AD versus controls 123,124, but studies with such negative findings are few in number.\nLooking beyond AD to studies in MCI and DLB, the literature is more compact, but also more variable. Chantal et al reported that NAA was largely normal in patients with mild AD or MCI compared to controls across the range of the usual voxel locations, and only reduced in left MTL grey matter, accompanied by increased Cho, while mI was only abnormal in parietotemporal cortex but was elevated in both AD and MCI subjects 125. Patients with amnestic MCI had reduced NAA and elevated mI in posterior cingulate NAA 120. Metastasio et al reported that patients with stable MCI had normal NAA while those who went on to develop AD had early reduction in NAA in occipito-parietal white matter 126, but in this study mI was unchanged between all groups.\nImaging comparisons between patients with AD and DLB show distinctive differences in regional atrophy (see Section 3.1) and potential differences in white matter tracts (see Section 3.2) which raises the possibility that underlying metabolic changes may also be different. Extending the MRS methodology to examine multiple strategically placed voxels might then have increased diagnostic value. An early study comparing patients with DLB to controls found that NAA was reduced in both centrum semi-ovale and parasagittal parietal cortex, while mI was unchanged 127, with normal mI then contrasting with the majority of studies in AD. A more comprehensive recent study with multiple sampled volumes reported that NAA was significantly reduced in midline occipital grey matter in DLB but normal in AD, but this work found mI was equally elevated in AD and DLB 128. This work was supported by similar findings of reduced occipital lobe NAA in DLB compared to AD or controls 129.\nTo determine whether MRS could be used to monitor treatment, it is important to understand the temporal characteristics of metabolic change. A number of studies have recorded longitudinal data with a view to mapping the natural history and determining whether MRS could have prognostic value, particularly in people with MCI who may progress to a full AD diagnosis. In a very large (by MRS standards) study of over 500 community dwelling healthy volunteers (not MCI) followed over time, baseline white matter NAA levels were not different in those subjects who developed cognitive problems and AD over a 3-6 year time window 130, suggesting that MRS is not able to detect pre-symptomatic changes. Further, a study comparing changes in patients already classified as amnestic MCI (aMCI) with AD patients and controls demonstrated declining NAA levels in posterior cingulate in both AD and aMCI, but no differences in baseline levels between aMCI patients who converted to AD (n  18) versus those who did not (n  31) over a mean 13 month period 120. However, annualised rate of loss of NAA was highest in AD patients, then in aMCI who converted (although not statistically significant), and lastly in stable aMCI. In this study, ChoCre was reported to be elevated (which is not a common observation) and the rate of decline in ChoCre was greatest in the aMCI patients who converted to AD. A further and even more extensive study by the same group 131 used a combined MRI and MRS protocol to follow 1100 cognitively normal subjects over a median 2.8 year period. The ratio of NAAmI (which maximises numerical change since the component values typically individually show contrary changes in AD) was found to be predictive of individuals progressing to MCI and associated with cognitive decline, with further predictive value when combined with image-derived data on hippocampal atrophy.\nMRS investigation of GABA levels in neurodegeneration is one of the most recent areas of research, as spectral editing methods have become clinically accessible 132. In AD patients, Bai et al report normal GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex but reduced levels in precuneus 133. Liese et al extended this observation to subjects with MCI and also report low GABA in posterior cingulate cortexprecuneus 134. However, GABA was not different between patients with or without amyloid deposit (from PET imaging) and neither did it differ with APOE genotype, suggesting that GABA has less potential as a diagnostic biomarker. GABA measurements may however help shed light on mechanisms of disease symptoms. Our own recent work in Parkinsons disease dementia patients (PDD, a Lewy body disorder) showed that GABA levels were significantly lower in the visual cortex in patients suffering from visual hallucinations than in those without 135, suggesting that hallucinations may be in part driven by decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter action, consistent with loss of post-synaptic GABA receptors found by microarray analysis of visual cortex in post-mortem DLB brain 136.",

    "Relationship of MRS findings to neuropathology": {
      "text": "Of particular interest in the interpretation of these MRS findings are those studies which applied MRS to post-mortem samples in order to validate the in vivo observations in patients. The earliest such observation was by Kwo-On-Yuen et al. 137 who analysed perchloric acid extracts from brain samples from 7 patients with AD and noted that the NAA concentration was significantly reduced in areas known to be affected by the disease. While the degree of reduction was not dependent on disease duration, reduced NAA in the parahippocampal cortex correlated with clinical functional assessment (MMSE) made during the patient lifetime. These data provided underpinning evidence that even within the remaining non-atrophied tissue, metabolic abnormalities are present as a result of disease processes and strengthen the argument to develop MRS as a diagnostic tool. More recently, as the understanding of the association between specific protein accumulation and degenerative diseases has increased, further comparison of MRS and neuropathological findings have been made. Murray et al 138 compared immunohistochemical analysis of NFT, Ab, microglial and neuronal density in post-mortem tissue from posterior cingulate cortex with the MRS observations from the same cortical regions in the same patients during life. They observed that Ab burden was associated with elevated myoinositol but not with reduced NAA, while lower NAA was associated with increased phosphorylated tau. Murray et al interpret these findings that decreasing NAA represents loss of synapses and early tau-related pathology, while myo-inositol indicates presence of Ab plaques 138.\nTo extend these observations, however, requires a shift to imaging evaluation using multi-voxel MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) capable of sampling cortical regions. In our recent comparative study of AD and DLB subjects, we applied an MRSI approach exploiting outer-volume saturation of skull (lipids) combined with multi-sliced, single spin-echo 2D spectroscopic imaging acquisition to acquire extended coverage imaging datasets 139. Voxelwise statistical comparison demonstrated patterns of reduced NAA, entirely consistent with the previous single voxel measurements in areas such as posterior cingulate cortex, but now revealing whole brain changes (Fig. 8b) which demonstrate some similarities to PET studies of tau distribution 140, but equally overlapping with features of Ab distribution 141 also.\nThese observations suggest that MRS does provide additional detail on disease activity within remaining tissue, which may be useful as MR-derived markers of disease, particularly when combined with other imaging-derived measurements as part of multi-variate analysis 131. In future work, extension of the MRS approach to an MRSI imaging solution 139,142 will undoubtedly enhance such multi-variate methods for disease monitoring. The precise nature of the additional diagnostic information which can be derived from MRSI compared with nuclear medicine tracers for the key disease-related proteins remains to be determined and is another area where PET-MRI can be of value.",

      "text": "Developments in technology, driven largely from the field of oncology diagnosis, have led to commercial availability of fully integrated PET and MRI technologies within the same scanner. In the simplest experimental design, these devices allow the full range of MR techniques to be simultaneously conducted alongside molecular imaging with appropriate PET tracers. The precise relationship between structural, micro-structural, physiological and metabolic features of the degenerating brain can then be investigated in detail. Of course, using separate scan acquisitions with PET-CT and MRI alongside image registration methods has always offered this possibility, but a single investigation has obvious benefits in these neurodegenerative disease populations. The logistics of PET-MRI scanning also force a re-evaluation of how the measurements are typically made, which may bring forward new opportunities. For example, conventional clinical PET-CT investigations using fluorinated tracers (e.g. FDG, Florbetapir, Florbetaben, etc.) administer the tracer with the patient outside of the scanner, and wait for equilibration before imaging. However, as the scan durations for the MRI acquisitions, particularly for multiparametric research studies can be rather longer than for PET, administering the tracer while the subject is in the scanner offers little disadvantage. Dynamic imaging of the tracer delivery may provide additional detail on regional perfusion at no cost to the rest of the acquisition 143144145.\nHowever, of greater interest is the potential for new study designs which cannot be achieved with simple combination of data from separate PET-CT and MRI scans. For example, recent work has applied simultaneous PET-fMRI acquisition to dynamically study the coupling of dopamine releasebinding and neural activity using the PET tracer  11 CRaclopride (a D2 dopamine receptors antagonist) combined with a monetary incentive fMRI task 146. While that study investigated patients with major depressive disorder, similar study designs could be translated directly into the field of neurodegeneration given the important changes in the dopaminergic system in DLB, Parkinsons Disease (PD) and PD Dementia (PDD). As the availability of PET-MRI and radiotracers grows, such studies may add a new understanding to the progression of brain pathophysiology in these patients.",

      "text": "One of the most recent advances in MR technology is the use of hyperpolarised tracers to detect pathology based on changes in dynamic metabolic processes. Molecular imaging by nuclear medicine methods provide extremely high sensitivity but cannot reveal the conversion of the tracer as it enters the metabolic pathway. Hyperpolarisation preparation of exogenous metabolic tracers enhances the spin polarisation by many orders of magnitude allowing them to be briefly followed in vivo. The use of highspeed MRSI methods provides dynamic maps of the tracer distribution and shows conversion to other metabolic products 147. Again, the primary focus for this methodology has been in cancer where the hyperpolarised tracer is rapidly delivered. The brain has been a secondary target, since the access of tracers across the blood brain barrier has been considered restrictive compared to the lifetime of the hyperpolarisation in vivo (10 s of seconds). However, recent studies have shown that hyperpolarised tracers can be tracked into the human brain and used to gain dynamic information on brain metabolism 148, which may pave the way for investigations in neurodegenerative diseases.",

These methods have led to an improved understanding of the effects of neurodegenerative disease and in the case of structural imaging have made observations which are sufficiently robust to be incorporated into the clinical diagnostic pathway. A limitation of much of the historical research has, however, been the use of small subject groups with imaging performed largely in isolation from other assessments such as genetic risk factors. The future of research into neurodegenerative diseases must lie, at least partly, in large scale, deeply phenotyped cohorts such that the data scale is sufficient to disentangle the many factors which influence the brain.",

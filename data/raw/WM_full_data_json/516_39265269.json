    "abstract": "Background: Few studies have quantitatively analyzed the imaging disparities between multiple sclerosis (MS) and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). We aimed to compare the imaging characteristics of MS and CADASIL in middle-aged patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study used a single-center database and included patients aged 40-60 years with MS and CADASIL who underwent the designated imaging protocol including 3D T1-weighted imaging and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion tensor imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging between January 2018 and March 2023. Patients with MRI-detected macrobleeds were excluded. Results: A total of 27 patients with MS (mean age, 46.7 years  4.4, 8 men) and 30 patients with CADASIL (mean age, 51.6 years  5.8, 14 men) were included. No significant differences were observed in the Fazekas grades of white matter lesions (WMLs). Patients with CADASIL exhibited greater external capsule involvement (56.7 vs.18.5 ; p  0.006), whereas the MS group had more lesions in the corpus callosum (81.5 vs. 53.3 , p  0.02) and brainstem (74.1 vs. 46.7 , p  0.04). The CADASIL group exhibited a higher incidence of microbleeds (12.07 vs. 0.11, p  0.001). The WMLs in the MS group exhibited a lower T1 lesioncerebrospinal fluid signal index (2.206 vs. 2.882, p  0.001). A value of 2.57 demonstrated a sensitivity of 92.6  and a specificity of 90.0  in differentiating MS. Patients with MS had a thinner corpus callosum (7.18 mm vs 7.86 mm, p  0.04), while patients with CADASIL showed significantly higher mean diffusivity (0.8776  10 -3 vs. 0.7637  10 -3 mm2s, p  0.03) and lower fractional anisotropy (0.7581 vs. 0.8389, p  0.04) in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Conclusion: Middle-aged patients with MS and CADASIL showed comparable Fazekas grades for WMLs. However, lesion distribution, T1 signal characteristics, and splenic diffusivity changes can help differentiate between MS and CADASIL.",

      "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a primary demyelinating disease that targets the central nervous system. It is characterized by a wide range of clinical symptoms, including motor, sensory, and autonomic impairments such as weakness, ataxia, and fatigue. The clinical course of MS includes can be relapsing, remitting, or progressive (Filippi andRocca, 2011, Sarbu et al., 2016). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often reveals ovoid or elongated plaques with T2FLAIR hyperintensity in specific locations, including the periventricular region, juxta-cortical areas, infratentorial region, and the spinal cord (Sarbu et al., 2016). Additionally, MS plaques can be accompanied by diffusely abnormal white matter, also known as dirty appearing white matter, which covers larger areas than typical plaques (Ge et al., 2003).\nAbbreviations: MS, multiple sclerosis; CADASIL, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; WMLs, white matter lesions; T2WI, T2-weighted imaging; T1WI, T1-weighted imaging; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; T1sig Index, T1 lesion signal index; T1std Index, T1 lesion signal standard deviation index; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; FA, fractional anisotropy.\nCerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), however, is the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). It is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19 (Chabriat et al., 2009, Tang et al., 2019). This disease primarily affects middle-aged adults and can present with various clinical manifestations such as migraine with aura, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, psychological disorders, and dementia (Chabriat et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2023). Common characteristic MRI features include white matter lesions (WMLs), lacunes, and microbleeds (Liem et al., 2008). Among these imaging features, WMLs are often the initial signs and can even present before the onset of clinical symptoms (Chabriat et al., 2009).\nDifferentiating MS from CADASIL can be challenging, particularly in middle-aged individuals with recurrent and progressive neurological symptoms (Geraldes et al., 2018). Although imaging studies play a crucial role in the diagnosis, both diseases can present with periventricular WMLs that exhibit subtle differences and may mimic each other (Saleem et al., 2019). Sathe et al. reported that approximately 40  (2050) patients with CADASIL were initially misdiagnosed as having MS (Sathe and Nunziato, 2015). Moreover, some of the misdiagnosed patients are even administered immunomodulatory therapy. Such misdiagnosis can result in suboptimal outcomes. However, only a few studies have quantitatively analyzed the imaging disparities between MS and CADASIL. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate these differences in a middle-aged population.",

      "text": "This retrospective study used data from the MS and CADASIL cohorts at National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2018 and March 2023, and employed the same MRI protocol for regular follow-up during periods of stable disease. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Taiwan University Hospital and conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.\nMS diagnoses were based on the McDonald criteria, using the 2010 criteria for cases diagnosed before 2017 and the revised 2017 criteria for those diagnosed afterward (Polman et al., 2011, Thompson et al., 2018). The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed by genetic testing, specifically by detecting the NOTCH3 mutations (Joutel et al., 1997, Liao et al., 2015). A total of 55 patients with MS and 68 patients with CADASIL were initially enrolled in this study (Fig. 1). We aimed to compare the WMLs in middle-aged patients in both groups; therefore, 28 patients with MS and 34 with CADASIL who were either above 60 or under 40 years of age, were excluded. Four patients with CADASIL demonstrating macrobleeds (intracerebral hemorrhage size 10 mm) were also excluded. Finally, 27 patients with MS and 30 patients with CADASIL were included in the analysis. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in patients with MS and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with CADASIL were administered.",

WMLs observed on T2WI and FLAIR were graded using the Fazekas scale (Fazekas et al., 1987). The presence or absence of WMLs in other locations, including the corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), juxtacortical region, anterior temporal lobe, external capsule, brainstem, and cerebellum, was carefully checked on FLAIR and T1WI and recorded.\nMicrobleeds (diameters 10 mm) were detected using SWI. The total number was counted individually and recorded based on the anatomical location. The presence of lacunes, defined as cavitated lesions measuring 3-15 mm in size, exhibiting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals on all sequences and located in the territory of perforating arteries, was recorded (Wardlaw et al., 2013).",

Enlarged perivascular spaces, defined as linear or oval lesions along the course of penetrating vessels, with CSF signal on all pulse sequences and a diameter of less than 3 mm, as well as lacunes, were excluded from the measurement analysis (Wardlaw et al., 2013).\nThe largest T1 hypointense lesion in each case was chosen as the target for measurement. If the largest lesion was less than 10 mm in its greatest dimension, the three largest lesions were selected instead of just one. If the WMLs were extensive bilaterally, the left parietal WML was selected for measurement. Manual outlining was performed to delineate the boundaries of the selected lesions on axial T1WI. The average T1 signal and the standard deviation were recorded for each lesion. To adjust for variations in signal intensity gains across individual MRI scans, the CSF T1 signal was used for calibration. The CSF T1 signal was measured by manually outlining the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle (Supplementary Figure 1). The T1 lesion signal index (T1sig Index) was calculated as the ratio of the measured T1 signal to the CSF signal. Similarly, the T1 lesion signal standard deviation index (T1std Index) was determined by dividing the T1 signal standard deviation by the CSF signal.",

For each participant, ADC and FA maps were co-registered with the corresponding 3D T1WI using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (http:fil.ion.ucl. ac.ukspm). On 3D T1WI, a volume of interest (VOI) was created for the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum using MRIcron software (https:people.cas.sc.edurordenmricron). The VOI extended over six contiguous slices in three orthogonal directions (size  6 mm  6 mm  6 mm). Its center was determined by cross-referencing the axial, coronal, and sagittal views and leaving at least two voxels between its margin and the ventricular wall to reduce the partial volume effect. The VOI was then overlaid onto the co-registered ADC and FA maps, and the mean values were recorded (Supplementary Figure 3).\nFurthermore, we conducted a subgroup analysis focusing on cases with less severe WMLs, specifically excluding those classified as Fazekas grade 3 in either the periventricular or subcortical regions.",

Patients with CADASIL exhibited a higher prevalence of external capsule involvement than those with MS (56.7 vs. 16.5 , p  0.006). In contrast, patients with MS showed a higher percentage of corpus callosum involvement (81.5 vs. 53.3 , p  0.02), specifically in the body of the corpus callosum (81.5 vs. 46.7 , p  0.007), and brainstem involvement (74.1 vs. 46.7 , p  0.04), than patients with CADASIL. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of involvement of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, juxtacortical region, anterior temporal lobe, or cerebellum (Table 1, Figs. 2 and3). In the MS group, the EDSS score moderately correlated with both the total (r  0.47, p  0.013) and periventricular (r  0.50, p  0.009) Fazekas grades. In the CADASIL group, although a moderate negative trend was observed (r  -0.31 for total Fazekas grade and r  -0.31 for periventricular Fazekas grade), the MMSE score did not significantly correlate with the WML grading.\nRegarding T1 signal analysis, the MS group showed a significantly lower T1sig Index but a higher T1std Index than the CADASIL group (2.206  0.33 vs. 2.886  0.41, p  0.001; 0.309  0.1 vs. 0.237  0.66, p  0.003, respectively) (Table 1, Fig. 4). Using Youdens index, the optimal cut-off value for the T1 signal index was  2.57, yielding a sensitivity of 92.6 , specificity of 90.0 , positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.3 , and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.1  for predicting MS.\nMicrobleeds were significantly more common in patients with CADASIL than in those with MS, with a higher prevalence in all locations (lobar, deep, and infratentorial). The average number of microbleeds was also significantly higher in the CADASIL group (12.07  18.4 vs 0.11  0.42, p  0.001). Only two patients with MS exhibited microbleeds, which were located in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (Table 1). Lacunes were observed in 17 patients (56.7 ) in the CADASIL group but not in the MS group.\nThe mean thickness of the corpus callosum was found to be significantly thinner in the MS group than in the CADASIL group (7.18  1.38 mm vs 7.86  0.97 mm, p  0.039). Conversely, the Evans ratio did not exhibit a significant difference between the two groups (0.24 0.02 vs 0.25  0.03, p  0.127) (Table 1). In terms of clinical condition, the MS group exhibited moderate correlations between the EDSS score and both mean corpus callosum thickness (r  0.45, p  0.019) and Evans ratio (r  0.55, p  0.003). In the CADASIL group, no significant correlation was observed between MMSE score and either parameter.\nIn the subgroup analysis (excluding patients with Fazekas grade 3), 22 and 17 patients had MS and CADASIL, respectively. The distribution of WMLs in this subgroup was comparable to that of the original analysis. In addition, the MS group exhibited significantly higher involvement of the cerebellum (45.5 vs. 5.9 , p  0.011). Furthermore, the MS group continued to exhibit a significantly lower T1 signal Index and higher T1 standard Index than the CADASIL group. Although microbleeds were more frequently observed in the CADASIL group, this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, the MS group still demonstrated a tendency towards thinner corpus callosum; however, this finding was not statistically significant (Table 1).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative and semiquantitative investigation to compare imaging differences between MS and CADASIL. Our focus was on individuals aged 40-60 years of age, as this age range has been associated with a significant number of misdiagnosed cases reported in existing literature (Joshi et al., 2017, Motolese et al., 2020).\nWe used the Fazekas scale to grade WMLs in both groups, which is widely used and is considered a simple and reliable tool for WMLs classification (Fazekas et al., 1987). Grading, including the deep white matter, periventricular white matter, and their combination, did not reveal any significant differences between the MS and CADASIL groups. This strengthened the analysis by minimizing bias and providing a more concrete assessment of the two groups.\nPrevious studies have described a characteristic pattern in CADASIL et al., 2001). However, in our study, there was a higher but non-significant prevalence of anterior temporal lobe involvement in patients with CADASIL. Temporal lobe involvement is not uncommon in MS and has been associated with psychiatric symptoms (Silveira et al., 2019). Furthermore, the extent of the anterior temporal lobe involvement in CADASIL may vary among different ethnic groups. Liao et al. reported that the R544C mutation, the most common mutation type in Taiwanese patients with CADASIL, is associated with less frequent involvement of the anterior temporal lobe than that in Caucasian populations (Liao et al., 2015). In contrast, we observed a significantly higher rate of external capsule involvement in patients with CADASIL than in patients with MS, which is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated a high prevalence of external capsule involvement in patients with CADASIL (Liao et al., 2015, Pescini et al., 2012, Cheng et al., 2020). Overall, the discriminatory value of external capsule involvement in distinguishing MS from CADASIL may be higher than that of the anterior temporal lobe involvement.\nIn general, patients with MS a higher prevalence of WMLs in the corpus callosum than patients with CADASIL. This finding aligns with previous research that reported callosal lesions in MS, ranging between 55-90  (Simon et al., 1986, Cocozza et al., 2017). Few studies have investigated the prevalence of corpus callosum lesions in patients with CADASIL, ranging from around 40-60  (Coulthard et al., 2000, Ouin et al., 2023). It is crucial to note that CADASIL, unlike other atherosclerotic SVD, has a higher likelihood of involving the corpus callosum owing to its distinct pathogenesis and arteriolar anastomosis (Stojanov et al., 2015). This unique characteristic can sometimes lead to confusion in interpreting corpus callosum lesions, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis of MS (Joshi et al., 2017, Carone, 2017). We found a significant difference between the two diseases in the body of the corpus callosum, but not in the genu or splenium. Additionally, patients with CADASIL exhibited a higher ADC and lower FA in the splenium of corpus callosum than patients with MS. However, this difference was diminished in the subgroup analysis, suggesting that increased disease severity might lead to a greater tissue alteration gap between CADASIL and MS. Recent studies have established an association between corpus callosum WMLs and clinical conditions (Ouin et al., 2023). Zhang et al. have demonstrated that changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum are specifically related to cognitive function (Zhang et al., 2021). These unique topographic patterns identified on structural images and DTI play pivotal roles in distinguishing between MS and CADASIL.\nThe WMLs in both groups showed hypointensities on T1WI. Previous research has highlighted the significance of low T1 signals in MS plaques, sometimes referred to as black holes (Truyen et al., 1996). These T1 hypointense lesions represent tissue destruction, axonal loss, and edema associated with inflammation (Filippi andRocca, 2011, Bitsch et al., 2001). By contrast, white matter lacunes are common in CADASIL and are sometimes mistaken for black holes. T1 hypointense lesions other than lacunes in CADASIL may represent chronic ischemia and astrocyte loss (Hase et al., 2018). Our study revealed that WMLs in MS had lower lesionCSF signal ratios on T1WI with higher standard deviations, which may suggest more focal and severe structural damage, leading to lower and more heterogeneous signals. A cut-off value of 2.75 for the T1sig Index also shows high sensitivity and specificity in guiding the differentiation between the two diseases. This could serve as a potential marker for distinguishing between these two diseases.\nBrain atrophy is a critical parameter linked to clinical severity and a vital endpoint in clinical trials for both diseases (Peters et al., 2006). Corpus callosum atrophy may occur earlier than general brain atrophy (Dietemann et al., 1988) and has been identified as an indicator of cognitive impairment (Goncalves et al., 2018). We observed that the MS group exhibited thinner callosum than the CADASIL group, suggesting a more severe white matter loss. Although this outcome may have been influenced by the longer disease duration in the MS group, it remains noteworthy.\nOur study had several limitations. First, our sample size was relatively small, which was a deliberate choice to focus on the middle-aged population, a group at higher risk for misdiagnosis. Second, the crosssectional and retrospective design introduced inherent selection biases, as the patients included may have had varying disease severities and durations, potentially affecting the imaging results. Future prospective longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the disease progression and changes in imaging features over time. Additionally, the imaging techniques used, particularly the 5 mm slice thickness in DTI sequences, may lack the resolution required to detect subtle differences.\nIn summary, middle-aged patients with MS exhibit a higher frequency of WMLs in the brainstem and corpus callosum, whereas patients with CADASIL show a higher occurrence of WMLs in the external capsule along with an increased prevalence of microbleeds and lacunes. While MS patients has more pronounced atrophy of the corpus callosum, CADASIL patients exhibit significant tissue alterations in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Additionally, WMLs in MS demonstrate a lower T1 signal index than those in CADASIL. A better understanding of the imaging differences between MS and CADASIL in middle-aged populations may facilitate more accurate imaging diagnosis and management.",

      "text": "The human apolipoprotein E (APOE) 3 gene instructs the making of apoE protein, which contributes to the construction of myelin sheath. APOE has been found to affect the deposition of amyloid- (A) in the brain, which is one of the leading causes of the Alzheimers disease (AD) 1. APOE has three allelic variants (2, 3 and 4), of which APOE 4 allele has been confirmed as the strongest genetic risk factor of AD 2. Individuals with APOE 4 are three to four times more likely to develop AD, and they have a younger mean age at onset than APOE 4 non-carriers 3. Thus, APOE 4 carriers are a critical target population for the screening and monitoring of AD.\nThe mechanism of how APOE 4 leads to the increased risk of AD is still unknown, but APOE does influence a variety of cellular processes from the development, the plasticity to the repair of both gray and white matter 4. Neuroimaging is a potential tool to study the changes caused by APOE and to look for early signs of AD in the APOE 4 carriers for potential screening in this higher-risk group. Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a set of structural and functional brain differences between APOE 4 carriers and non-carriers in heathy adults of various age groups and genotype-specific brain differences before cognitive decline 5678910111213141516.\nCoherent spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations of 0.01-0.1 Hz in the blood oxygenlevel-dependent (BOLD) signal reflects gross cortical excitability and neuronal synchronization and more importantly, the coding of cognition at rest state. Despite the abundant researches trying to link APOE 4 with various brain function 171819, it is still uncertain whether APOE 4 risk gene have modulated spontaneous neural activity in the resting state due to previous inconsistent results. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in BOLD signals can provide signal changes underlying spontaneous neural activity, reflecting baseline brain activity. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) method also reliably measures the coherence of spontaneous brain activity by quantifying the intra-cluster information similarity, serving as a valuable imaging feature for exploring pathological changes in brain gray matter activity 20. White matter degradation is accompanied with gray matter changes in AD, which typically spreads from the brain regions that are late in myelination development 21,22. This loss of axonal myelination adversely affects neuronal synchrony 23. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography quantifies the density of white matter-insulated axonal bundles that connect different brain regions, serving as the main working vehicle to study the brain whiter matter abnormality and to measure white matter integrity, by analyzing indexes including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (Da1), radial diffusivity (Dr), etc. It has been reported that a rapid decrease in myelination and FA can be found in the APOE 4 carriers when compared with the non-carriers 242526.\nIn this work, we aim to investigate the modulation of APOE 4 on brain activity and morphology, as well as the significance of these imaging markers for the detection of early changes in a high-AD-risk group, by studying the clinical background and imaging features of two cognitively intact aged groups (APOE 4 risk gene carriers and non-carriers). We hypothesized that certain brain regions will be significantly modulated by the presence of APOE 4. ALFF and ReHo were employed to analyze spontaneous gray matter activity and parameters extracted from DTI were used to study white matter. Morphology changes were also evaluated on MRI. Finally, these imaging indicators were correlated with clinical evaluation scores.",

Among the 2067 participants, there are 309 cognitively intact elderly 4 (APOE 4 non-carriers and 116 are APOE 4 carriers). To verify our hypothesis, we chose APOE genotype (34) as APOE 4 carriers and APOE genotype (33) as APOE 4 non-carriers. The point that needs to be made is 44. According with inclusion criteria, there is only 1 participant carriers genotype 44, so we did not select this participant.

For each participants, we discarded the first five time points to avoid transient signal changes before magnetization reached steady-state and participants adaptation to the funtional MRI scanning noise. The rest images were performed slice timing correction for different signal acquisition, and then realigned to the first volume to correct for head motion. Participants with head motion exceeding 1.5 mm in any dimension of x, y and z or 1.5  in any angular motion were eliminated for further analysis (a total of 10 participants were excluded). Next, we spatially normalized images to Montreal neurological institute (MNI) space by individual T1-weighted anatomical images which had been registered to the mean functional image and re-sampled them to a voxel size of 3  3  3 mm 3 . Then, the functional images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of six mm FWHW (full width at half maximum) to decrease spatial noise.

      "text": "DTI data preprocessing included the following steps using a pipeline tool, PANDA 38. First, to avoid the possible susceptibility distortions, DTI images were corrected by estimating a field distortion map based on five b  0 images. The distortion map was computed with a reversed k-space readout 39. For each participant, this distortion map was applied to 41 weighted images, resulting in a corrected DTI set which was consistent with a single un-weighted corrected b0 image and 41 corrected weighted images. Second, DTI images were corrected for eddy-current distortions 40 and realigned to b0 image. Third, the diffusion tensor elements were estimated using a robust tensor fitting method, with the principal eigenvector of the eigenvalue decomposition of the fitted tensor being computed as the diffusion direction within each voxel 41. Fourth, the level of FA of each voxel was computed based on computed eigenvalues, and then the information on the level of the preferred diffusion direction within a voxel was provided 42. Finally, the deterministic fibers were tracked using the extracted information on the preferred diffusion directions with each voxel in the brain mask and fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm. All the fiber tracts were computed by seeding each voxel with an FA  0.2. We obtained a streamline by following the main diffusion direction of each seed by voxel to voxel, and the streamline was stopped when the fiber tract made a sharp turn of 45  or reached a voxel with an FA value 0.2.\nIn addition, diffusion MRI is by construction highly sensitive to head motion, thus head motion (even if small) can bias derived results in groups where there are motion differences 43. In order to examine if there are any differences in head motion between APOE 4 carrier and noncarrier, we extracted the head motion information of each participant in the two groups. Then, we tested the group differences in head motion followed those in Power et al.s 73 study and found that there are no significant differences in head motion between the APOE 4 carrier and noncarrier (Table 1).",

This averaged square root was taken as the ALFF measurement. For standardization, the ALFF of each voxel was further divided by the global mean of ALFF values (mALFF).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the attenuation of APOE 4 risk gene in brain function, brain structure and correlated clinical significance, to testify the role of APOE 4 in the process of sporadic AD by imaging techniques. Our results revealed that APOE 4 modulated gray matter activity majorly in default mode network (DMN) regions including ACC, MTG, mPFC and PreCU in an increase-and-decrease pattern; also, it modulated white matter integrity in corona radiata and genu of corpus callosum, both of which have been shown involved in AD previously; moreover, the MD of right superior corona radiate was significantly correlated with both MMSE scores and gross white matter volumes in the carriers, indicating its relationship with disease progress and potential as an severity predictor. Our results validated our hypothesis and revealed that APOE 4 risk gene is an important factor in modulating brain gray matter activity and white matter integrity, even before any clinical or neuropsychic expression of imminent disease.\nIn cognitively intact elderly, we found that regions related with crucial cognitive and memory functions are affected. Some regions exhibited increased gray matter activity in the APOE 4 carriers, including ACC and mPFC. ACC has a crucial role in the integration of neuronal circuitry for attention-cognition 46. mPFC has also been implicated in the integration of cognitive and emotional stimuli 47. Conversely, activity of PreCU was reduced in the carriers, but the ReHo was enhanced in PreCU, MTG and cerebellum. Both PreCU and MTG have been well established to play key roles in episodic memory 48,49, which is one of six major memories and is most significantly clinically relevant for AD 50. Aside from regional functions, moreover, all the involved regions belong to DMN. DMN represents a network of low frequency fluctuation, composed of regions with elevated activation in relative rest and suppressed activation during cognitive activities, such as the encoding of new memories 515253. It is the most studied network during resting state and task-related investigation and has been confirmed to be largely affected by the neurodegenerative process of AD.\nPrevious researches have also demonstrated the effect of APOE 4 gene on the brain activity, some of them reflecting brain activity through function connectivity. These researches majorly revealed decreased brain activity, functional connectivity, regional coherence or regional homogeneity in either carriers of APOE 4 gene or AD patients, with a wide range of ages 7,13,14,54. However, there are also researches with opposite results: Filippini et al. investigated the structural and functional effects of APOE 4 in young healthy carriers and found DMN coactivation in carriers compared to non-carriers 11. Another study on familial AD (FAD) showed that the 20-year-old mutation carrier exhibited increased, while the middle-aged mutation carrier exhibited decreased, brain activity during episodic learning and retrieval task, indicating that the compensatory effects to overcome preclinical dysfunction may develop decades before clinical manifestations 12. The difference of these results including previous studies and the current research could be due to the disease progression, normal aging, other factors related with disease progression and image analytical methods.\nAnother phenomenon worth noticing is: the mixed activity pattern in the current research revealed elevated activity in anterior regions and decreased activity in more posterior region, where, however, regional homogeneity was enhanced. This is in accordance with the pattern of Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA), which has been shown attenuated by the presence of AD; additionally, later developed cortices are more vulnerable to age-related atrophy, such as the anterior region-medial prefrontal area 6,55. Continuous elevated baseline neuronal activity could persuasively contribute to increased amyloid production and deposition over time, especially in DMN regions, which is also regulated by APOE 4 56,57. According to Reiman et al. 58, and Small et al. 59, cognitively intact APOE 4 carriers also showed increased uptake of the amyloid binding ligand PIB and the amyloid and tau binding ligand FDDNP when compared to APOE 4 non-carriers. Besides, previous studies have been investigating the relationship between functional connectivity and amyloid- (A) deposition, revealing significant correlation between the level of A deposition and decrease in aged-related functional connectivity 60,61.\nTherefore, based on the results of the current research and some aforementioned previous studies, it is tempting to conclude that long time before the onset of AD, APOE 4 can specially regulate brain activity including metabolic activity in the DMN where the later developed cortices are more vulnerable to atrophy and damage, and thus promotes the development of the disease.\nIn accordance with gray matter activity analysis, white matter integrity analysis showed that both the MD value and Da (1) were reduced in the genu of corpus callosum; MD was also reduced in the superior corona radiata in APOE 4 carriers compared to noncarriers. These regions do have been reported to be modulated by APOE 4 5,6,62. They play key roles in the communication of cognitive, motor and emotional information 636465, and have been found to be involved and closely related with the progression of AD. Especially, the genu of corpus callosum is composed of small diameter fibres and myelinates much later in normal development while the other parts myelinate early in development.\nHowever, according to previous studies, the most frequent finding in AD patients or APOE 4 gene carriers (especially the aged) is reduced FA, or elevated MD, or elevated Da 5,6,9,15,16. The elevation of MD can also be largely contributed to the elevation of Da in some situation 9. There are opposite results similar with the findings of our research, too: Huang el al. 8 performed a DTI study in patients of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early AD; they found that both MCI and early AD subjects showed decreased Da compared with normal controls in the temporal normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Another study investigated the white matter tracts in AD and found various patterns of DTI index changes in different regions 66.\nCombining with the gray matter analysis results in the current study, the change in DTI indexes may be due to the early progression before the onset of the disease; also, the involvement of the regions conforms with both previous conclusions and the above gray matter activity results in that the later developed regions are more vulnerable.\nHowever, the fact hard to neglect is that, when it comes to DTI indicators, it is seldom the case to identify a coherent conclusion from previous research results related with AD, even though the consideration is only regarding one specific region of the brain, such as the corpus callosum 64. Although we can contribute the difference of the studies to the progression of the disease, the subject characteristics or the calculation methods, it might be enlightening to consider accentuating on the changes of DTI indexes on an individual level in the population at risk of AD, rather than purely endeavoring to investigate for a universe standard of index level.\nFurthermore, the MD values of left superior corona radiata had significant positive correlation with gross white matter volumes and significant negative correlation with MMSE scores (Fig. 3), suggesting the clinical significance of MD index. As pointed out in previous studies, it is closely associated with the degeneration of the brain 67.\nAlthough APOE 4 modulation were observed in brain gray matter activity and white matter integrity in cognitively intact elderly, in brain morphological analysis, no significant difference was found in either brain graywhite matter morphology or the gross graywhite matter volume in the two groups, suggesting that both groups had fairly equitable measures of brain parenchyma.\nIt was interesting because we expected that, at least, in the APOE 4 carriers with higher risk of AD, there would be some changes as shown in two previous studies 68,69. However, several other studies also observed no APOE 4 related structural differences in healthy elder 26,70,71. Merging our results and previous findings, we suggest that brain activity, and white matter related measurements such as MD are more sensitive than graywhite matter structure related measurements to detect the physiological influences of APOE 4 gene.",

    "Limitation": {
      "text": "Several concerns need to be taken into account in the current study. Firstly, although our study points to a differential role for the modulation of APOE 4 risk gene on brain gray matter activity and white matter integrity, the neuroimaging and molecular mechanisms and the relationship between them require further investigation. Secondly, in the ADNI database, the sample of APOE 4 carriers are relative small when we took the imaging modality, age, gender and clinical scores into account. Larger samples would be needed to explore the modulation of genes on gray matter activity and white matter structure in healthy and neuropsychiatric disorders in future studies. Thirdly, we found there were no significant differences in brain morphology. Compared with previous studies, conflicting conclusions need to further affirm in the following study. Finally, it should be noted that the changes in gray matter activity and white matter integrity that we observed in APOE 4 carriers may be associated with the modulation by other genes in coupling disequilibrium with APOE 4 72 although we try to rule out family history of genetic factors. Very limited literature has been found working on the individual modulation effects of a certain gene excluding related genes. Further study considering this factor will be included in our future researches.",

      "text": "). There was no significant difference in the Activity of Daily Living Scale score among the three groups (P0.654). The plasma Aβ42 level showed no significant difference among the three groups (P0.227). The plasma Aβ40 level in the vMCI group was higher than that in the HC group (P0.014),while it showed no significant difference between aMCI and HC groups (P1.000). The plasma Aβ4240 levels in aMCI and vMCI groups showed no significant differences from that in the HC group (P1.000,P0.105),while the plasma Aβ4240 level was lower in the vMCI group than in the aMCI group (P0.016). The FA value of the left anterior limb of internal capsule in the vMCI group was lower than those in HC and aMCI groups (all P0.001). The MD values of the left superior corona radiata,left external capsule,left cingulum (cingulate gyrus),and left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the vMCI group were higher than those in HC (P0.024,P0.001,P0.003,P0.001) and aMCI (P0.015,P0.004,P0.019,P0.001) groups,while the MD values of the right posterior limb of internal capsule (P0.005,P0.001) and left cingulum (hippocampus) (P0.017,P0.031) in the aMCI and vMCI groups were higher than those in the HC group.In the aMCI group,plasma Aβ4240 level was positively correlated with FA of left posterior limb of internal capsule (r0.403,P0.015) and negatively correlated with MD of the right fonix (r-0.395,P0.017).In the vMCI group,plasma Aβ4240 level was positively correlated with FA of the right superior cerebellar peduncle and the right anterior limb of internal capsule (r0.575,P0.008;r0.639,P0.002),while it was negatively correlated with MD of the right superior cerebellar peduncle and the right anterior limb of internal capsule (r-0.558,P0.011;r-0.626,P0.003).Conclusions Plasma Aβ levels vary differently in the patients with aMCI and vMCI.

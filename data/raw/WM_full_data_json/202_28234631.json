    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising imaging technique that provides insight into white matter microstructure integrity and it has greatly helped identifying white matter regions affected by Alzheimers disease (AD) in its early stages. DTI can therefore be a valuable source of information when designing machine-learning strategies to discriminate between healthy control (HC) subjects, AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Nonetheless, several studies have reported so far conflicting results, especially because of the adoption of biased feature selection strategies. In this paper we firstly analyzed DTI scans of 150 subjects from the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. We measured a significant effect of the feature selection bias on the classification performance (p-value  0.01), leading to overoptimistic results (10 up to 30 relative increase in AUC). We observed that this effect is manifest regardless of the choice of diffusion index, specifically fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Secondly, we performed a test on an independent mixed Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine 4 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed. 5 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by different stages, ranging from a pre-dementia phase to a final stage in which the patient is completely dependent from external assistance. Estimates indicate that 75 of dementia cases in the world, more than 25 million people, are of Alzheimers type (Reitz and Mayeux 2014). Nevertheless, the investigation of novel biomarkers and strategies to predict and model its onset needs further investigation (Allen et al 2016). In particular, the investigation of biological markers aimed at diagnosing the disease promptly is crucial (Jongkreangkrai et al 2016). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between healthy aging and AD, which represents an early state of abnormal cognitive function and is thus considered a good target for this investigation.\nOver the past twenty years, several studies based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) highlighted the significant role played by brain atrophy in AD diagnosis (Tangaro et al 2014, Amoroso et al 2015, Jongkreangkrai et al 2016). Since 1980s it is also known that, besides a widespread gray matter atrophy, AD is characterized by a progressive disconnection of cortical and subcortical regions because of white matter (WM) injury (Rose et al 2000, Head et al 2004, Wang et al 2016). However, conventional MRI is not able to highlight the structure of WM regions due to their homogeneous chemical composition.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to track and quantify water diffusion along white matter fiber bundles and can thus provide useful information regarding their integrity (Basser et al 1994, Huang-Jing et al 2015). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are among the invariants derived from the diffusion tensor that are closely related to white matter integrity (Le Bihan et al 2001). Water diffusion along a healthy axon is highly anisotropic, being constrained almost completely to one direction, that is the fibre axis, and thus high values of FA and low values of MD describe a non-pathological scenario. FA and MD maps can be visualized as conventional gray-scale images and can be subsequently analyzed by means of classification tools. In recent years, DTI has revealed itself as a very promising imaging modality to discriminate between healthy control (HC) subjects, AD patients and subjects with MCI. An analysis approach commonly found in literature consists in the computation of FA and MD maps (or other diffusion indices), followed by the identification of the most representative voxels; these voxels are then fed into machine-learning algorithms to automate the classification.\nFor the discrimination HCAD, Mesrob et al (2012) adopted a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and a region of interest (ROI)-based approach; Dyrba et al (2015b) used a ROI-based approach and a multimodal SVM combining DTI indices with gray matter volume derived from sMRI; Amoroso et al (2016) adopted topological measurements based on probabilistic tractography; Schouten et al (2016) used a ROI-based approach in combination with elastic net regression. For the classification HCMCI, Cui et al (2012) used subcortical volumetric features extracted using a segmentation algorithm together with FA values obtained for white matter regions of interest. Dyrba et al (2015a) used a ROI-based approach and SVMs on a multicentric dataset and apply variance reduction methods.\nThe best performances in literature for the HCMCI classification, using a single DTI modality, can be found in Haller et al (2010) andODwyer et al (2012). In these works, a voxel-based approach is used considering as features the voxel intensities in the diffusion maps. However, as also remarked in O Dwyer et al (2012), in each of the above mentioned work, the methodological procedure relies on an a priori feature selection performed on the entire dataset to be analyzed. This procedure, also known as non-nested feature selection, circular analysis, or double dipping, chooses the most discriminative voxels by using also the test set, thus introducing a bias in the classification model. A non-nested feature selection necessarily leads to overestimate the numerical values of accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC). On the contrary, a nested feature selection is obtained when the selection procedure is performed blind to the test set.\nThe practice of double dipping and its dangers are well known to the statistics and computer science community, and have been extensively described in the literature (Singhi andLiu 2006, Kriegeskorte et al 2009). Although recommendations and best practices are available (Pereira et al 2009), the field of neuroimaging is still widely populated by studies that noticeably perform non-nested feature selection, claiming classification performances close to perfect accuracy. The effects of double dipping on classification performances in neuroimaging studies have been quantitatively assessed when dealing with functional brain data, such as fMRI (Pereira et al 2009) or MEG (Olivetti et al 2010), and with data derived from structural T1-weighted MR imaging (cortical thickness) in Eskildsen et al (2013). However, some of the image classification studies involving DTI cited above seem to be affected by such feature selection bias, and to date no study has yet investigated to which extent the reported performances are inflated by its presence.\nIn this work we used DTI images for classification tasks in AD; considering the profitability of using classification trees in the context of machine learning techniques applied to AD (Salas-Gonzalez et al 2010, Lebedev et al 2014), we used a random forest approach. The main aim of this work is to perform a comparative study between nested and non-nested feature selection on the same data set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to measure the bias introduced by non-nested feature selection, from now onward feature selection bias (FSB), in the classification of DTI images with a fair comparison, i.e. measuring the effect on the same fixed data set. We finally confirmed on an independent test set how the FSB impacts the reliability of estimated classification performances.",

      "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimers disease.\nThe images analyzed for this study are diffusion-weighted scans of 150 subjects (50 HC, 50 AD patients and 50 MCI), both males and females, aged 55 to 90, from the ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 phases. Scans were randomly selected from baseline and follow-up study visits. HC subjects show no signs of depression, mild cognitive impairment or dementia; participants with AD are those who meet the NINCDSADRDA criteria for probable AD; MCI subjects have reported a subjective memory concern, but without any significant impairment in other cognitive domains: they substantially preserved everyday activities with no signs of dementia. Two MCI levels (early or late) are usually distinguished according to the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II. For this study, we used a balanced group of 25 early and 25 late MCI, but these labels were not taken into account in the classification tasks. Further details about diagnostic criteria for ADNI study participants can be found at http:adni.loni.usc.edu study-designbackground-rationale.\nIn order to evaluate the proposed algorithm on an independent test set, a second different set of scans from the ADNI database was also considered, consisting of 40 HC, 40 MCI (22 early and 18 late) and 39 AD. This second test set included both male and female subjects, and was age-matched with the training sample. Diffusion-weighted scans were acquired using a 3 T GE Medical Systems scanner with 41 gradient directions (b  1000 s mm -2 ); in addition to these, 5 images with negligible diffusion effects (b 0 images) were acquired as reference scans for subsequent analysis.",

      "text": "After preprocessing, a single diffusion tensor was fitted at each voxel in the image, using DTIfit. From the diffusion tensor, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were then calculated. By definition, these two invariants are related to the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 by Basser et al (1994) and Le Bihan et al (2001):\n(1)\nconstrained almost exclusively to the fiber direction, due to the presence of the surrounding myelin sheath. FA is typically higher in white matter than in grey matter or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is an established marker of microstructural fibre integrity, in the sense that its value decreases in presence of axonal degeneration or demyelination. MD instead relates to the mean free path of water molecules in all directions. It is typically of the same order of magnitude in gray and white matter, while being consistently higher in the CSF, and can be regarded as an inverse measure of membrane density. Increases in MD in white matter areas are therefore indicative of myelin disruption or loss (Feldman et al 2010, Alexander et al 2011).",

    "Tract-based spatial statistics": {
      "text": "After diffusion tensor fitting, FA and MD maps need to be carefully aligned to a group-wise space before any voxel-wise statistical analysis is carried out; in addition to this, it is desirable to restrict the analysis only to voxels belonging to white matter fiber bundles. All this was achieved by means of the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) algorithm implemented in FSL (Smith et al 2006). TBSS performs the following steps:\nIdentify a common registration target (it can be either a mean FA template provided with the software or the most representative subject of the cohort) and apply nonlinear registration to align all subjects FA maps to the selected target. The chosen target was the FMRIB58_FA standard-space FA template, generated by averaging 58 FA images from diffusion MRI data, in MNI152 space.  After the nonlinear registration, the entire aligned dataset undergoes an affine transformation to bring it into   1 1 1 mm 3 MNI152 space. Then, a mean FA image is created, averaging all the FA maps in the dataset, and the result is used to generate a mean FA skeleton of white matter fibre tracts common to all subjects. The mean skeleton is thresholded to exclude voxels belonging to gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid, as well as voxels from the outermost part of the cortex, which are zones of greater inter-subject variability. Figure 2 shows an example of FA map (figure 2  Finally, all subjects FA images are projected onto the mean FA skeleton, achieving an alignment between subjects in the direction orthogonal to the fibre bundle orientation.\nTBSS was performed also on MD maps. After applying TBSS, each subjects map comprised about  7 10 6 nonzero voxels.",

      "text": "As a result of TBSS, the skeleton of main white matter fibre tracts was extracted from each subject, together with the corresponding values of FA and MD at each voxel in the skeleton.\nApproximately 120 000 voxels for each subject map were projected onto the skeleton.\nThe following stage aimed at assessing which voxels are most significant for the purpose of discriminating HC from AD and MCI. It is important to note that it is not possible to rely on any assumption about the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis; this implies that any statistical test has to be non-parametric. Wilcoxon rank sum test and the ReliefF algorithm were used both within a non-nested and nested approach. A Wilcoxon test compares the medians of the groups of data to determine if the samples come from the same population, and returns a p-value for the null hypothesis that samples are drawn from the same population (Whitley andBall 2002, Hollander et al 2013). Then voxels are ranked selected by thresholding on p-values. The basic principle of ReliefF (Kira and Rendell 1992, Kononenko et al 1997) is to estimate features according to how well their values distinguish among data instances close to each other. Features are then ranked and sorted in order of decreasing importance.\nFor each classification task, fifteen reduced datasets were created by selecting an increasing number of most discriminating voxels, depending on the feature selections output: 50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500,600,750,1000,2000 and 3000 voxels.",

    "The feature selection bias effect": {
      "text": "A primary question about the effects of excluding the feature selection from cross-validation procedures is whether or not the induced FSB is affected by the different kind of information employed, specifically FA and MD. Another question concerns the size of this effect. Besides, we also investigated whether or not the FSB was associated with the diagnosis, thus we separately studied the binary classification of HCAD and HCMCI. Finally, we included in our investigation two different feature selection techniques to assess whether the FSB effect could in some way depend on the methodology adopted to select the features. Mean AUCs for the classification involving both FA and MD measurements are plotted in figure 3 with both feature selection techniques.\nIt can be observed that switching from non-nested to nested feature selection, for the classification between HC and AD, accuracy considerably decreases from a maximum mean value of 0.87 to a maximum value of 0.75, while the best AUC drops from 0.96 to 0.84. It is worth noting that the best performance is obtained using ReliefF, but for both feature selection techniques a significant drop in performance is consistently seen. The performance decrease switching from non-nested to nested approach is more evident for the classification between HC and MCI: the best classification performance changes from 0.81 to 0.59 concerning accuracy, and from 0.90 to 0.65 concerning AUC.\nThe same procedure was applied using MD. It is worth noting that moving from non-nested to nested feature selection, for the classification between HC and AD, best mean accuracy and AUC decrease respectively from 0.83 to 0.76 and from 0.90 to 0.82. For the discrimination HCMCI the best accuracy falls from 0.79 to 0.60, while AUC decreases from 0.88 to 0.65. Again in this case, ReliefF performed better and the same performance deterioration detected for FA is clearly recognizable.\nFor each classification task and for each feature selection technique, the best performances in terms of mean accuracy and mean AUC are summarized in table 1.\nThe boxplot in figure 4 shows the distributions of the differences between the AUC values obtained in non-nested and nested best cases. It can be noticed that the FSB effect occurs regardless of the diffusion index (FA or MD) used for the classification and that this effect is more pronounced in the HCMCI classification task. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to assess differences between the performance distributions with the nested and non-nested approach in a non-parametric fashion. Statistically significant differences (p  0.01) were found between the median best performance obtained in the two cases (nested and non-nested) for all classification tasks and for both FA and MD. However, it must be noted that, for a given diffusion index (FA or MD), classification task (HCAD or HCMCI) and approach (nested or non-nested), the 100 measured performance metrics are not independent samples: all the 100 repetitions make use of the same images, and within each repetition there is substantial overlap among the training folds used for the crossvalidation. It has been shown that, in cases like the present one, no unbiased estimator exists for the variance of the k-fold cross-validation (Bengio and Grandvalet 2004). The dependence of the samples and the impossibility to get an unbiased estimation of the variance violate the Table 1. The first column refers to the classification task. Best average performances in terms of accuracy (Acc) and area under the curve (AUC) obtained in cross-validation with non-nested and nested feature selection are respectively reported in the second and third column; values are affected by a standard error of the mean approximately equal to 0.01 and a standard deviation approximately equal to 0.10. Non-nested feature selection always yields higher performances.",

    "DTI measurements: evaluation on an independent test set": {
      "text": "It is worth noting that the information coming from the voxel selection can be used to identify the most disease-related brain regions concerning the fiber integrity. Therefore, in the present study, it was also investigated whether the voxels selected during the feature selection were localized in specific regions of interest of the brain.\nFor each classification task (HCAD and HCMCI) and for each feature selection technique (Wilcoxon and ReliefF), we considered the 1000 most discriminative voxels selected by the averaged nested feature-selection. They are averaged in the sense that they are the voxels that were more frequently selected throughout all the 500 rounds of the entire nested crossvalidation procedure. Two selected clusters of FA voxels are shown as an example in figure 5.\nThe position of the voxels derived from the average cross validation was then investigated. In order to carry out the disease-related-regions analysis, a combination of three atlases (HarvardOxford-Subcortical, JHU-ICBM-labels, JHU-ICBM-tracts) was used. More precisely, using the voxels selected from the FA maps, the comparison of HC and AD reveals differences predominantly in the anterior corona radiata (bilateral but more widespread in the left hemisphere) but also in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (more widespread in the left hemisphere), fornix, cingulum (Hippocampus), forceps major and minor, inferior fronto occipital fasciculus (right), cortospinal tract, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus (right, only with Wilcoxon), superior corona radiata and external capsule (only with ReliefF). In the comparison between HC and MCI the FA changes are predominantly located in forceps minor, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule (left) and, to a minor extent, in inferior fronto occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cortical spinal tract, fornix, forceps minor, anterior limb of internal capsule, left cerebral cortex. Concerning the voxels selected from the MD maps, comparing HC and AD, the predominant changes are localized in fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus (more widespread in the left hemisphere in the case of Wilcoxon), anterior thalamic radiation, splenium and body of corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata (left). In the case of HC versus MCI, the MD differences are predominantly in anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto occipital fasciculus (right), forceps major, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation (right), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, forceps minor.\nThe effectiveness of the voxels selected by the nested cross-validation in discriminating the diagnostic groups was then evaluated on a second independent set of images from the ADNI database, consisting of new scans of 40 HC, 40 MCI and 39 AD. We considered the classification tasks HCAD and HCMCI with FA and MD and adopted the classification tool obtained at the end of the training phase. In particular, we considered only those models constructed on the reduced sets of voxels corresponding to the best classification performance and by fixing the feature selection technique adopted, i.e. ReliefF.\nIn order to evaluate the classification performances on the new data set, we calculated the mean scores, indicating the average predicted class posterior probabilities obtained by all models; then we calculated accuracy and AUC accordingly. The results obtained are reported in the third column of table 2. It can be noticed that they fall within one standard deviation of the corresponding mean value (second column).",

    "Discussion and conclusion": {
      "text": "In this study we show that: (i) the use of non-nested feature selection techniques leads to overoptimistic classification performance; (ii) the FSB is manifest both for FA and MD, thus it does not depend on the features adopted; (iii) the FSB effect is more evident for the HCMCI classification tasks.\nThe results obtained show that the voxel-based approach adopted in this study, without the bias introduced by the a priori feature selection, does not improve the classification performance obtained with other methodological procedures, except for the AUC achieved in the discrimination of HC versus AD using FA. For the latter, the best accuracy is higher than the accuracy achieved by Mesrob et al (2012) and slightly lower than the value obtained by Schouten et al (2016). Conversely, the AUC achieved is slightly higher than the one obtained by Schouten et al (2016). For the classification HCMCI it can be noticed that the accuracy and the AUC achieved with nested feature selection is lower than the one obtained in Cui et al (2012); similarly, for the same classification task, the outcome is lower than the value obtained by Dyrba et al (2015a).\nIf such detrimental effects on performance were somehow expected, it is worth noting that, as far as we know, no other study has measured this effect in the field of machine learning techniques applied to diffusion tensor imaging for AD. Furthermore, our findings regarding the significant regions for AD are consistent with several studies involving DTI, also when using other datasets than ADNIICBM, thus reassuring about the informative content of the voxel-based approach from the clinical point of view. Therefore the presence of the FSB in some studies using this approach is not detrimental to the anatomical and biological plausibility of the findings. In general, the existing literature provides evidence about the vulnerability of fornix, corpus callosum and cingulum to the early disease process involved in AD (Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor 2014). In particular, the white matter changes we found in the Fornix in all classification tasks (to a minor extent in the discrimination between HC and MCI using FA) have been reported in Oishi and Lyketsos (2014) and Nowrangi and Rosenberg (2015). Indeed, FA reduction in the Fornix has been identified in the majority of whole-brain-TBSS studies applied to AD. Similarly, the predominant differences we observed in cingulum, in the classification HCAD using FA, are confirmed by looking, for example, at Teipel et al (2007) and Agosta et al (2011). Additionally, the changes we observed in the Splenium of Corpus Callosum, when classifying HC versus AD using MD, have been reported in Stahl et al (2007) and Teipel et al (2007). The most consistent results with our findings are those reported in Stricker et al (2009), where significant changes have also been found in uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major, and in Sousa Alves et al (2012), which identified changes in anterior corona radiata, inferior fronto occipital fasciculus and forceps minor. Finally, we remark that Sousa Alves et al (2012) also confirms the predominance of differences in the left hemisphere we found in our analysis. participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, individuals with early or late MCI, and those with early AD.

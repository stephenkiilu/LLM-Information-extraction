    "abstract": "Impairments of social cognition are often leading features in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and likely to reflect large-scale brain network disintegration. However, the neuroanatomical basis of impaired social cognition in FTLD and the role of white matter connections have not been defined. Here we assessed social cognition in a cohort of patients representing two core syndromes of FTLD, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n  29) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA; n  15), relative to healthy older individuals (n  37) using two components of the Awareness of Social Inference Test, canonical emotion identification and sarcasm identification. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to derive white matter tract correlates of social cognition performance and compared with the distribution of grey matter atrophy on voxel-based morphometry. The bvFTD and svPPA groups showed comparably severe deficits for identification of canonical emotions and sarcasm, and these deficits were correlated with distributed and overlapping white matter tract alterations particularly affecting frontotemporal connections in the right cerebral hemisphere. The most robust DTI associations were identified in white matter tracts linking cognitive and evaluative processing with emotional responses: anterior thalamic radiation, fornix (emotion identification) and uncinate fasciculus (sarcasm identification). DTI associations of impaired social cognition were more consistent than corresponding grey matter associations. These findings delineate a brain network substrate for the social impairment that characterises FTLD syndromes. The findings further suggest that DTI can generate sensitive and functionally relevant indexes of white matter damage in FTLD, with potential to transcend conventional syndrome boundaries.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to a heterogeneous group of non-Alzheimer dementias collectively characterised by progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and presenting with insidious disintegration of social behaviour or language (Ratnavalli et al., 2002;Rosen et al., 2005;Hodges and Patterson, 2007;Kipps et al., 2009;Rohrer and Warren, 2010;Omar et al., 2011;Rascovsky et al., 2011;Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011;Rohrer et al., 2011;Whitwell and Josephs, 2011;McGinnis, 2012;Warren et al., 2013a). These diseases collectively constitute a common cause of young-onset frontotemporal dementia (Ratnavalli et al., 2002), pose substantial problems of nosology and diagnosis, and highlight the fundamental neurobiological problem of selective neurodegeneration.\nThese challenges are well illustrated by the canonical FTLD syndromes of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA, or semantic dementia). Clinically, bvFTD characteristically manifests with progressive behavioural deterioration leading to severe social dysfunction that may be misdiagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder (Rosen et al., 2005;Kipps et al., 2009;Omar et al., 2011;Rascovsky et al., 2011), while svPPA presents with progressive erosion of semantic memory manifesting as loss of knowledge about words, objects and concepts, typically with supervening behavioural and personality changes later in the course (Hodges and Patterson, 2007;Rohrer and Warren, 2010;Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). Both syndromes potentially hold unique insights into the neurobiology of social cognition and the impact of disease on its critical brain substrates. Emerging structural and functional neuroimaging evidence has implicated specific largescale brain networks in the pathogenesis of bvFTD and svPPA: in the case of bvFTD, a salience network that processes emotionally significant internal and external stimuli including social signals (Seeley et al., 2009;Zhou et al., 2010) and links distributed brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and insula; and in the case of svPPA, a semantic network that associates multimodal sensory and symbolic data with meaning, instantiated in the anterior temporal and inferior frontal lobes (Hodges and Patterson, 2007;Fletcher and Warren, 2011). Differential involvement of these networks may provide candidate brain substrates for social cognition deficits in these syndromes (Seeley et al., 2009;Zhou et al., 2010Zhou et al., , 2012;;Irish et al., 2011;Raj et al., 2012).\nSocial cognition is a multi-dimensional and still poorly understood aspect of human brain function (Zahn et al., 2007;Adolphs, 2009;Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012;Olson et al., 2013); it typically entails emotional, semantic, mnestic and evaluative processing of sensory signals, and yet specialised brain systems underpinning social cognition have been inferred from evidence in the healthy brain and in disease states, suggesting that it might be a useful paradigm for detecting and tracking the clinical course of diseases in the FTLD spectrum. Indeed, the multidimensionality of social cognition is reflected in the diverse deficits described in bvFTD, including multimodal recognition of canonical emotions (Omar et al., 2011;Kumfor et al., 2013), empathic concern and perspective taking (Rankin et al., 2005;Mahoney et al., 2011), mentalising (Le Bouc et al., 2012;Downey et al., 2013), perception of humour and sarcasm (Snowden et al., 2003;Kipps et al., 2009), affective decision making (Torralva et al., 2007), moral reasoning (Chiong et al., 2013) and conceptualising self in relation to others (Irish et al., 2011). Although social cognition deficits in svPPA are less widely documented, a number of studies have reported similar abnormalities of social functioning in these patients (Rankin et al., 2009;Zahn et al., 2009;Duval et al., 2012).\nThe processing of sarcasm is an attractive model for probing component processes of social cognition that are vulnerable in FTLD syndromes (Kipps et al., 2009;Rankin et al., 2009). Sarcasm exemplifies a familiar and relatively simple paralinguistic cue that must be processed according to social context in order to understand the verbal message; as a stimulus feature, sarcastic intent is straightforward to manipulate and its detection can be reliably assessed (McDonald et al., 2006). Improved understanding of the brain mechanisms of sarcasm processing and social dysfunction more generally could potentially facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis and symptom management in FTLD and ultimately, evaluation of therapies in clinical trials. The overlapping phenomenology of interpersonal difficulties exhibited by patients with bvFTD and svPPA might reflect underlying neural substrates that are at least partly shared, consistent with convergent profiles of regional brain damage in these syndromes (McGinnis, 2012;Warren et al., 2013b); and impaired detection of sarcasm has been shown to predict and to track progression in bvFTD (Kipps et al., 2009;Kumfor et al., 2014). Impaired understanding of sarcasm has been linked to damage involving distributed neural networks including the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobes and their connections, also implicated in processing sarcasm and other social signals in the healthy brain (Zahn et al., 2007;Adolphs, 2009;Carrington and Bailey, 2009;Kipps et al., 2009;Davis et al., 2015).\nThis work contributes to a growing body of evidence associating particular social cognition deficits with regional brain damage in FTLD (Mahoney et al., 2011;Le Bouc et al., 2012;Chiong et al., 2013;Rankin et al., 2009;Zahn et al., 2009;Moll et al., 2011). To date, however, neuroanatomical correlative studies have focussed essentially on grey matter alterations: if (as neuroimaging work in the healthy brain strongly suggests), the processes that underpin social cognition are distributed across brain networks, then techniques that can assess structural and functional connections between individual brain regions will be required in order to delineate fully the brain mechanisms that support social cognition and the effects of disease. This is particularly relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as FTLD that are inherently network-based (Warren et al., 2013b). White matter tracts bind brain networks, and techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can assess the microstructural integrity of white matter connections and correlate these with clinical deficits (Whitwell et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2013;Tovar-Moll et al., 2014). DTI has been shown to detect white matter alterations in genetically mediated FTLD prior to the onset of symptoms or cortical atrophy, suggesting a potential role as a sensitive disease biomarker (Dopper et al., 2013).\nHere we investigated white matter correlates of social cognition impairment in bvFTD and svPPA using DTI. We correlated DTI metrics with indices of canonical emotion identification (a key component of social signal coding) and sarcasm identification (a model of everyday social signal interpretation) in naturalistic vignettes. DTI data were analysed using a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) processing pipeline that makes minimal prior assumptions about key sites of disease involvement and is therefore relatively anatomically unbiased. White matter alterations were correlated with the distribution of grey matter atrophy assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We hypothesised that white matter alterations would target pathways binding the distributed fronto-temporal and limbic networks previously implicated in neuroimaging studies of social cognition in the healthy brain and in neurodegenerative disease. We further hypothesised that white matter signatures of impaired social cognition would constitute transsyndromic substrates for the overlapping behavioural deficits that characterise the bvFTD and svPPA syndromes clinically. DTI measures of axial (AX), radial (RD) and total (trace, TR) diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assessed in parallel, given previous work suggesting that different DTI measures may constitute relatively specific indices of structural or functional integrity in white matter pathways (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Whitwell et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2013Mahoney et al., , 2014)).",

    "Assessment of social cognition": {
      "text": "The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) (McDonald et al., 2006) was used to assess participants3 ability to identify basic emotions and sarcastic intent in social situations. This test has been widely used as a measure of social cognition performance in clinical contexts and requires interpretation of posed but relatively naturalistic social scenarios. We administered an abbreviated TASIT comprising emotion identification and sarcasm identification subtests derived from the first portions of the respective subtests in the full TASIT. In the emotion identification subtest, 14 audio-visual video vignettes (each 15-20 s duration) conveying either a positive (surprised, happy), neutral or negative (anger, disgust, sadness or anxiety) emotional valence were presented in randomised order; the task on each trial was to decide which emotion was dominantly portrayed in a seven-alternative forced-choice procedure. In the sarcasm identification subtest, nine video vignettes were presented in randomised order, each displaying one of three conditions: sincere intent, simple sarcasm (i.e., intended meaning simply at odds with the message surface structure as delivered) or paradoxical sarcasm (i.e., an elaborated message that would seem nonsensical unless sarcastic intent is recognised, requiring deeper encoding of the social interaction. The task on each trial was to decide how those in the vignette felt, how they were trying to make others feel, and the underlying intent of their interactions or statements (assessed using four questions, yielding a total score of 12 for each condition). Participants were familiarised with each task to ensure that they understood it prior to commencing the test; during the test, no feedback about performance was given and no time limit was imposed. As the TASIT includes a component of verbal comprehension, a trial vignette was administered prior to formal testing to ensure that participants adequately understood the task and the vocabulary used (three more severely affected patients with svPPA were excluded on this basis).\nSocial cognition measures, general neuropsychological data and general demographic characteristics (age, gender) were compared between participant groups using Stata12. Repeated-measures analysis of variance regression models were used to assess group differences in performance scores, age and gender. British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS; a standard measure of verbal semantic function, Dunn et al., 1982) scores were included as a covariate in regression models assessing TASIT subtest performance, in order to adjust for verbal comprehension ability.",

Normalisation, segmentation, modulation and smoothing of grey matter images using a 6 mm kernel size were performed using default parameter settings and the final images were affinetransformed into MNI space prior to analysis. In order to adjust for individual differences in head size total intracranial volume (TIV) was calculated for each participant by summing grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes following segmentation of all three tissue classes, and used as a covariate in subsequent analyses. In order to display results, a study-specific template brain image was created by warping all native-space whole-brain images to the final DARTEL template and calculating the average of the warped brain images.",

      "text": "General linear models were used to examine the relationship between social cognition performance measures and both white matter tract microstructure and regional grey matter volume. Separate models were used to assess TASIT emotion identification scores and TASIT total sarcasm identification, simple sarcasm identification and paradoxical sarcasm identification scores as functions of regional grey matter volume and diffusivity metrics, with age, TIV (calculated as described above) and disease group membership included as covariates. To minimise confounding effects from correlated general semantic, executive or disease severity factors, raw scores on the BPVS and a Stroop ink colour naming test (a standard executive measure) were included as additional nuisance covariates in the model design. In the DTI analyses, FA, AX, RD and TR metrics were analysed separately. In each case, relationships between the behavioural and neuroimaging metrics were assessed across the two syndromic groups, in each syndromic group separately, and contrasting the two syndromic groups. In the grey matter analysis an additional step was applied to minimise voxel drop-out due to marked local regional atrophy in particular scans. The analysis was performed within a customised brain mask based on a specified voxel threshold intensity criterion (Ridgway et al., 2009) whereby a voxel was included in the analysis if grey matter intensity at that voxel was N0.1 in N70 of the participants. Statistical analyses for both white matter and grey matter analyses were implemented using the permutation-based (non-parametric) randomise tool within FSL with 5000 permutations generated for each test. For all analyses, a significance threshold (p  0.05) was applied following correction for multiple comparisons using family-wise error correction with threshold-free cluster enhancement (Smith and Nichols, 2009) over the whole brain. Further information on the significant results generated from each model in the DTI analysis was extracted using FSL3s cluster to determine if multiple anatomical clusters of white matter alteration occurred within each contrast and to extract information on the statistical significance and spatial extent of each anatomical cluster. To determine involvement of specific white matter tracts the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 DTI white matter atlas was registered to the study specific mean FA image (Wakana et al., 2007). The peak coordinates from each cluster were located using the atlas to determine if they lay within the boundary of a particular white matter tract; if the peak co-ordinates were unclassifiable, then the co-ordinates were inspected visually to assign an approximate location of the cluster within a particular brain region.\nMaps of disease-associated grey and white matter alteration were generated for each syndromic group relative to a historical age-and gender-matched cohort of healthy individuals (n  20, seven female, mean age 64.5  4.5 years) for which brain MR images were previously obtained using the same scanner and acquisition parameters. Grey and white matter disease maps were generated using the same parameters as previously specified.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Here we have used an anatomically unbiased DTI protocol to delineate white matter tract associations of cognitive processes relevant to social signal encoding (canonical emotion identification) and interpretation (sarcasm identification) in two canonical FTLD syndromes with prominent social difficulties. In line with previous work (Torralva et al., 2007;Kipps et al., 2009;Rankin et al., 2009;Duval et al., 2012;Shany-Ur et al., 2012), both the bvFTD and svPPA groups exhibited deficits of emotion identification and sarcasm interpretation and deficits were comparably severe in both groups. White matter signatures of brain network damage underpinning these social cognition deficits were widely distributed, overlapping networks implicated in social cognition in the healthy brain (Adolphs, 2009;Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012;Zahn et al., 2009;Carrington and Bailey, 2009) and in association with focal brain damage (Rankin et al., 2005(Rankin et al., , 2009;;Mahoney et al., 2011;Moll et al., 2011;Downey et al., 2013). Furthermore, there was extensive overlap of white matter tract signatures between the bvFTD and svPPA groups: the evidence for separable, syndrome-specific signatures (i.e., profiles of neuroanatomical associations that differed between syndromes) was relatively sparse, consistent with core white matter tractbased mechanisms of social cognitive dysfunction that are common to both bvFTD and svPPA.\nWhite matter correlates of emotion and sarcasm processing here were identified after adjusting for generic cognitive (semantic and executive) indexes, suggesting a relatively specific association with social cognitive operations rather than a more general association with disease severity. Attempts to define neuroanatomical correlates of behaviour in disease states are potentially biased by the brain topography of particular diseases, which tend to limit the associations that can be observed. In the present study, this was addressed by adjusting DTI regression analyses for disease group membership, allowing us to identify associations extending across syndromes in the combined patient cohort as well as syndrome-specific associations. Together this evidence suggests that bvFTD and svPPA involve common large-scale networks mediating social cognition, albeit with a regional emphasis that is modulated by syndrome; and that social cognition processes may constitute trans-syndromic signatures of brain dysfunction in FTLD. Moreover, white matter tract correlates of social cognition impairment here were only partly convergent with (and more consistent than) the grey matter correlates identified in the corresponding VBM analyses: this underlines both the potential of DTI to reveal disease signatures that may not be fully delineated using grey matter imaging techniques, and the critical role of white matter pathway integrity in maintaining normal brain network function.\nThe most robust white matter associations of emotion and sarcasm processing here were identified within tracts previously implicated in linking cognitive and evaluative processing with emotional responses, as part of a broad repertoire of cognitive operations supported by these tracts. Abnormal diffusivity in the anterior thalamic radiation was identified as a correlate of emotion identification in the combined group and within the svPPA group; and a correlate of sarcasm identification within the bvFTD group. The anterior thalamic radiation participates in thalamo-fronto-striatal re-entrant circuits and has widespread projections to the prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain regions. Both in the healthy brain and in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, this tract has been implicated in various cognitive operations that mediate the social context of emotional signals, including reward and punishment potential, gating and cognitive meaning of affective signals and pervasive induced mood states that may promote evaluation of emotional experiences (Haxby et al., 2002;McIntosh et al., 2008;Cheon et al., 2011;Joutsa et al., 2011;Coenen et al., 2012;Rigucci et al., 2013;Erpelding and Davis, 2013;Fujino et al., 2014;Han et al., 2013;Ameis and Catani, 2015).\nImpaired emotion identification in the combined cohort and within the bvFTD group was strongly associated with altered diffusivity in the fornix, consistent with other work in FTLD syndromes (Omar et al., 2011;Kumfor et al., 2013). The fornix is a core limbic tract that links primitive affective, autonomic and homeostatic mechanisms with autobiographical memories and cortical evaluative mechanisms. The role of the fornix is best established within the domain of episodic memory (Rolls, 2015); its contribution to the processing of emotion is more controversial and has been more widely studied in animal models (Decker et al., 1995;Degroot and Treit, 2004;Acevedo et al., 2012). However, in line with the present findings, fornix damage has previously been associated with altered hedonic valence of sensory stimuli and abnormal emotional behaviours (Kazlouski et al., 2011;Maier-Hein et al., 2013;Modi et al., 2013;Poreh et al., 2013;Ameis and Catani, 2015).\nImpaired sarcasm detection in the combined cohort and within the bvFTD group was strongly associated with abnormal diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus: this tract is part of the extended limbic system (Pugliese et al., 2009) and plays a key role in associating linguistic and paralinguistic information coded in the anterior superior temporal cortices with affective, motivational, evaluative and mentalising mechanisms in the inferior frontal cortices (Von der Heide et al., 2013;Ameis and Catani, 2015). The uncinate fasciculus has been identified previously as a key locus of pathology in DTI studies of bvFTD and svPPA (Agosta et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2013;Tovar-Moll et al., 2014) and damage involving this tract has been associated with altered social behaviour, abnormal evaluation of affective states and impaired empathy (Pugliese et al., 2009;Phan et al., 2009;Tartaglia et al., 2012;Oishi et al., 2015).\nThe grey matter (VBM) and white matter (DTI) correlates identified here together support previous evidence implicating the right temporal lobe in sarcasm detection (Kipps et al., 2009;Rankin et al., 2009) and further define the brain network underpinning the processing of sarcasm. In particular, the present data are consistent with a model in which the anterior temporal lobe structures process associative meaning and affective tone of speech signals, the inferior frontal cortices disambiguate paralinguistic intent and the uncinate fasciculus acts as the key route of reciprocal information transfer between these grey matter hubs (Von der Heide et al., 2013). However, white matter associations of social cognitive performance were not restricted to the anterior frontotemporal tracts: diffusivity correlates were also identified within long intra-hemispheric pathways including the inferior and superior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. These pathways have been correlated previously with general measures of social cognition such as emotional intelligence (Takeuchi et al., 2013), and may link sensory processing mechanisms with limbic and motor output mechanisms including those that mediate social mirroring actions (Hecht et al., 2013). Such long tract associations underline the distributed nature of the brain networks that support social cognition processes (Phan et al., 2009;Mahoney et al., 2011;Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012;Kumfor et al., 2013;Chiong et al., 2013;Ameis and Catani, 2015). More particularly, damage involving the sagittal stratum (a fibre bundle that subsumes a number of long projection pathways) has been linked specifically to impaired sarcasm processing after stroke (Davis et al., 2015).\nOf note, primary correlates of social cognition here did not include fronto-insular connections within the salience network previously implicated as central both to the pathogenesis of bvFTD and to processes supporting human social cognition (Seeley et al., 2009;Zhou et al., 2010). The present data suggest that additional, specific pathways and networks may be critical in supporting social cognition in FTLD as the core network disintegrates, while providing potential sites of anatomical convergence (such as the orbitofrontal cortex) where these networks might interact. A role for abnormal network interactions would be consistent with other work in FTLD syndromes (Chiong et al., 2013), while also allowing that extensive white matter pathway damage in other diseases (such as Alzheimer3s disease) may leave social capacities relatively unscathed (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010).\nOur findings illustrate the potential value of DTI as a functional and disease metric in FTLD. Neuroanatomical data derived from DTI and VBM should be compared with caution, given the different properties and technical bases of these modalities; with these caveats in mind, we analysed the present DTI and VBM data in a common preprocessing and statistical framework. Considering both social cognition metrics here, white matter associations were extensive and more consistent than regional grey matter associations, in line with other neuroimaging and neuropathological evidence for extensive white matter pathology in FTLD syndromes (Neumann et al., 2007;Hiji et al., 2008;Whitwell et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2012;Galantucci et al., 2011;Mahoney et al., 2013). The data corroborate previous work suggesting that DTI may generate sensitive, clinically relevant biomarkers of FTLD syndromes with potential to lead grey matter metrics (Borroni et al., 2007).\nWhite matter signatures based on the FA metric were substantially less extensive than for other diffusivity metrics here (Tables 2 and3). Information about the specific sensitivities and specificities of particular DTI metrics in disease states and as correlates of clinical dysfunction remains very limited. However, previous work has suggested that FTLD and other neurodegenerative conditions may produce more extensive changes in measures of absolute diffusion, such as RD than ratios such as FA (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Whitwell et al., 2010;Agosta et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2013Mahoney et al., , 2014)). This may in part reflect tissue microarchitectural specificity; AX is likely preferentially to index axonal degeneration and RD, demyelination (Song et al., 2002) in white matter pathways. The present data suggest that certain DTI metrics such as AX and RD may be more suitable than FA for tracking functionally relevant white matter alterations in neurodegenerative syndromes. Also in line with previous evidence (Whitwell et al., 2010(Whitwell et al., , 2011;;Rohrer et al., 2011;Mahoney et al., 2013;McMillan et al., 2013), these data raise the further interesting possibility that DTI signatures may have molecular specificity: svPPA is closely associated with TDP-43 pathology and produced a relatively discrete white matter network signature here, whereas bvFTD is pathologically heterogeneous and associated with more widespread network alterations.\nTaken together, these findings further define neurobiological signatures for the social impairment that characterises FTLD syndromes, grounded in the emerging neural network paradigm of neurodegenerative disease (Warren et al., 2013b). The findings suggest that certain DTI metrics provide sensitive and functionally relevant indexes of white matter damage in FTLD and support the further assessment of sarcasm as a useful model for probing social and other cognitive functions that depend on large-scale brain networks. It is important to emphasise that the white matter tracts associated with social cognitive impairment here have been implicated in a diverse spectrum of cognitive functions in previous work (Haxby et al., 2002;Poreh et al., 2006;Tartaglia et al., 2012;Han et al., 2013;Von der Heide et al., 2013). Accordingly, we do not argue that involvement of these tracts is a specific harbinger of social cognitive deficits; rather, degeneration of these pathways is likely to contribute to a range of behavioural and cognitive deficits in these syndromes. With that caveat in mind, social signals such as sarcasm may be a particularly sensitive probe of tract function in neurodegenerative diseases, due to the heavy demands such signals impose on the brain networks that decode sensory data for integration with affective, evaluative and mnestic processes.\nThe present study has several limitations that suggest directions for future work. The findings should be corroborated in larger cohort studies comparing other neurodegenerative diseases and mimic syndromes such as autism, schizophrenia and other primary psychiatric disorders (McIntosh et al., 2008;Miyata et al., 2010;Kazlouski et al., 2011;Rigucci et al., 2013;Fujino et al., 2014;Maier-Hein et al., 2014;Ames and Catani, 2015), which may also produce characteristic white matter changes and for which differentiating biomarkers are particularly required (Niida et al., 2013). These various disorders are likely to provide complementary insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social cognition and dysfunction; in particular, potential parallels between the neural substrates of FTLD and autism are intriguing and should be further explored (Noriuchi et al., 2010;Cheon et al., 2011;Ameis and Catani, 2015). DTI metrics generated using techniques based on whole-brain analysis (as here) lack fine-grained anatomical specificity and are subject to technical issues such as limited resolution of crossing pathways; future tractographic studies targeting specific white matter pathways are needed to address this issue and to define tract anatomy in detail. Longitudinal studies will be essential to establish the sequence of alterations in candidate behavioural and neuroimaging biomarkers, ideally including pre-symptomatic individuals with genetic forms of FTLD, in order to capture very early disease effects and to track disease evolution (Kumfor et al., 2014). Subsequent histopathological correlation will be required to assess the molecular specificity of biomarker signatures (Rohrer et al., 2011;Whitwell and Josephs, 2011;Warren et al., 2013a,b). In the face of these challenges, the present work suggests that white matter metrics of complex behavioural deficits can yield robust signatures of brain network disintegration in FTLD that may transcend conventional clinical and imaging markers.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a clinical diagnosis has limited specificity, and identifying imaging biomarkers may improve its predictive validity as a pre-dementia syndrome. This study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect white matter (WM) structural alterations in MCI and its subtypes, and aimed to examine if DTI can serve as a potential imaging marker of MCI. We studied 96 amnestic MCI (aMCI), 69 nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), and 252 cognitively normal (CN) controls. DTI was performed to measure fractional anisotropy (FA), and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were applied to investigate the characteristics of WM changes in aMCI and naMCI. The diagnostic utility of DTI in distinguishing MCI from CN was further evaluated by using a binary logistic regression model. We found that FA was significantly reduced in aMCI and naMCI when compared with CN. For aMCI subjects, decreased FA was seen in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital WM, together with several commissural, association, and projection fibres. The best discrimination between aMCI and controls was achieved by combining FA measures of the splenium of corpus callosum and crus of fornix, with accuracy of 74.8 (sensitivity 71.0, specificity 76.2). For naMCI subjects, WM abnormality was more anatomically widespread, but the temporal lobe WM was relatively spared. These results suggest that aMCI is best characterized by pathology consistent with early Alzheimers disease, whereas underlying pathology in naMCI is more heterogeneous, and DTI analysis of white matter structural integrity can serve as a potential biomarker of MCI and its subtypes.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical syndrome characterized as a transition stage between normal ageing and dementia (Petersen, 2001;Petersen et al., 1999). MCI has been classified into subtypes including amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) (Petersen, 2004) depending upon the presence or absence of memory impairment as a distinguishing feature. Patients with aMCI are considered to be at high risk of developing Alzheimers disease, whereas naMCI, characterized by non-memory cognitive dysfunction is more likely to progress to frontotemporal dementia, vascular or other types of dementias (Mariani et al., 2007;Rountree et al., 2007). The prevalence of MCI in individuals aged over 65 is reported to be 3 to 19 in different studies (Ritchie, 2004). Compared with agematched healthy elderly, the likelihood of developing dementia is 7 times higher in MCI patients (Boyle et al., 2006). Therefore, accurate diagnosis of MCI and prediction of its conversion to dementia would be of special importance for the early diagnosis and prevention of dementia if and when effective preventative strategies become available.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging tool capable of detecting brain structural changes and informing the structural basis of MCI. Several studies have examined gray matter (GM) abnormalities in MCI and early Alzheimers disease (AD). T1weighted structural MRI studies have reported that GM atrophy occurs primarily in the medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices in MCI and AD patients (Bottino, 2002;Chetelat and Baron, 2003;Dickerson, 2009;Du, 2001;Pennanen, 2004;Tapiola et al., 2008;Teipel et al., 2006). Volumetric reductions of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex have been consistently regarded as clinically useful biomarkers for the accurate diagnosis of MCI or early AD, and for the prediction of progression of MCI to AD (Bottino, 2002;Chetelat and Baron, 2003;Du, 2001;Pennanen, 2004;Tapiola et al., 2008). In addition to the investigation of gray matter structural changes in MCI, the integrity of white matter (WM) has been assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nDTI provides microstructural information about white matter integrity and coherence by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) values (Le Bihan et al., 2001;Mori and Zhang, 2006). DTI studies using conventional regions of interest (ROI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses have reported WM alterations in MCI individuals in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes (Medina et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006), posterior cingulum (Chua et al., 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2007;Zhou et al., 2008), splenium of corpus callosum (Cho et al., 2008;Chua et al., 2009;Parente et al., 2008), long association fascicles (Bai et al., 2009), and internal capsule (Chua et al., 2009;Medina et al., 2006). However, the above findings vary considerably on the anatomical locations of reduced FA measures. For instance, using ROI analysis, Chua et al. found significant FA reduction in the splenium of corpus callosum in MCI (Chua et al., 2009), but another study reported significant FA decrease in the genu of corpus callosum (Bai et al., 2009).\nThe application of ROI and VBM methods for DTI analysis has limitations. The placement of ROIs is a subjective process associated with only modest reliability and reproducibility. In addition, the partial volume effect can confound the results by including different tissue types (CSF or GM) in the same ROI, resulting in spurious DTI measurements. Although the observer-independent VBM-style DTI analysis circumvents the problems of ROI analyses, it also has limitations because of imperfect image registration, and random selection of smoothing factors (Smith et al., 2006). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) which retains the strength of VBM analysis while addressing the registration and smoothing issues, has been recently developed for automated whole brain DTI analysis (Smith et al., 2006). The TBSS method has been used to evaluate WM changes of aMCI and AD in previous studies (Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Liu et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2010;Serra et al., 2010;Stricker et al., 2009). However, conflicting findings have been reported across these studies. In subjects with aMCI, Damoiseaux et al. (2009) reported no significant FA reduction, whereas another study (Liu et al., 2009) showed significant FA decrease in the parahippocampal WM, uncinate fasciculus, and WM tracts of the brain stem and cerebellum. However this discrepancy may be due to limited sample size in both prior studies. Therefore, the effect of MCI pathology on the WM microstructural integrity should be further investigated in the population with large sample size.\nIn this study, we apply TBSS to investigate the white matter microstructural changes in MCI from a large population-based sample. Our previous study using a ROI approach in a subsample of this cohort reported white matter alterations in the frontal white matter, parahippocampal white matter, posterior cingulate, and splenium of corpus callosum in aMCI, while naMCI had abnormal white matter located in the frontal and occipital lobes, anterior limb of internal capsule, and posterior cingulate (Chua et al., 2009). To the best of our knowledge, most white matter studies using DTI are focused on aMCI (Bai et al., 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Huang et al., 2007;Medina et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006). Only two studies have investigated white matter structural integrity in naMCI (Chua et al., 2009;Kantarci et al., 2009), but the ROI approach of these studies is incapable of revealing the global pattern of white matter damage. We hope to address the above limitations in the current study. In addition, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging has been consistently thought to represent white matter abnormalities on the macrostructural level. However, it is still not well understood that whether disrupted white matter integrity measured by reduced FA values and WM lesions detected by T2 FLAIR image provide distinct information in terms of white matter abnormalities in MCI. Therefore, we also aim to investigate the relationship between DTI-based FA measure and WM lesions. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of DTI in distinguishing MCI from cognitively normal subjects will be evaluat-ed. We hypothesize that white matter alterations in aMCI typically occur in the memory network, whereas naMCI shows more diffuse white matter degradation, and DTI can provide extra information when compared to conventional WMH measure.",

      "text": "Participants were recruited from wave 1 of the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS), a longitudinal study of a population-based sample of older non-demented people living in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The community dwelling individuals were approached randomly using the electoral roll from two electorates, and those willing to participate were contacted by telephone for eligibility. Those who had a previous diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, developmental disability, progressive malignancy were excluded as were participants suspected of having dementia based on an adjusted mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score of less than 24 (Folstein et al., 1975) at initial evaluation or if they received a diagnosis of dementia after comprehensive assessment. In addition, participants were required to have sufficient English language abilities to complete the assessment. Informed written consent was provided by each participant. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of New South Wales and the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service.\nThe total sample comprised 1037 subjects aged between 70 and 90 years, of whom 542 underwent MRI scans. The current report utilized a subsample of 417 participants with MRI scans who had an English-speaking background and complete neuropsychological test scores. The subjects included 252 cognitively normal individuals, 96 diagnosed as aMCI and 69 diagnosed as naMCI based on a consensus conference. Participants were classified as MCI if they met the most recent international consensus criteria (Winblad, 2004), that is: (1) complaint of decline in memory andor other cognitive functions by the participant or a knowledgeable informant; (2) preserved instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), defined here as a total average score b 3.0 on the Bayer ADL Scale (Hindmarch, 1998); (3) objective cognitive impairment operationalized as at least 1.5 SD below the normative data of any one neuropsychological test. Entry requirement of MMSE  24 satisfied the other MCI criterion of generally normal cognitive function. For aMCI diagnosis, impairment on any one neuropsychological assessment in the memory domain was necessary, and if this was absent and yet MCI criteria were met, naMCI was diagnosed.\nDemographic profiles of each group and between-group comparisons are presented in Table 1. Briefly, in comparison with controls, aMCI subjects were significantly older, more depressed, with poorer cognitive functioning, and more likely to be male, while naMCI individuals only had significantly lower cognitive test scores than cognitive normal subjects. Compared with naMCI, aMCI had a significantly greater proportion of males, were older and more educated. In addition, since we did not exclude subjects who were on psychotropic medications, we performed a statistical analysis to investigate the potential bias due to psychotropic medications, and found that the proportions of subjects in the three groups taking psychotropic medications were not significantly different, nor was their demographic profile (see Supplementary Table 1).",

      "text": "Diffusion tensor image processing All DTI data were preprocessed offline on a Linux system-based workstation using the FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT), which is a part of the FMRIBs Software Library (FSL) program (http:www. fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, Oxford University, UK). The raw DTI images were visually inspected, and then corrected for eddy current and head motion by registering each participants 6 diffusion weighted images to their own T2-weighted (b  0) image using an affine image registration (FLIRT), which is part of FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2002). Brain extraction was performed to remove non-brain structures, using brain extraction tool (BET) implemented in FSL (Smith, 2002). Thereafter, diffusion tensor was reconstructed by fitting a diffusion tensor model to each image voxel of the preprocessed DTI data, using the DTIfit program included in FSL. Following this, the fractional anisotropy (FA) map was calculated.\nThe resulting FA images were fed into TBSS, which is also a part of FSL, to carry out the voxel-wise statistical analysis (Smith et al., 2006). In brief, the FA maps of all participants were spatially transformed to a 1  1  1 mm MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) standard space by the nonlinear registration method FNIRT. The nonlinearly registered FA images were further averaged to generate a mean FA image. A nonmaximum suppression algorithm was applied afterwards to search the image voxels with highest FA value along the direction perpendicular to the local tract surface to create a mean FA skeleton. The mean FA skeleton was further thresholded by a FA value of 0.2 to exclude the skeleton voxels which may contain gray matter or cross-subject image misalignment. Following the thresholding of the mean FA skeleton, each individuals transformed FA map was projected to the mean FA skeleton to create a skeletonized FA map which is the input image in the later voxel-wise statistics across participants, by assigning the maximum FA value in the tract-perpendicular direction to the corresponding skeletal point.\nThe averaged values of the skeletonised FA maps from 5 participants who were scanned on both scanners were calculated and correlated across scanners to assess the effect of scanner change on the FA measure. The resulting high correlation coefficient (r  0.976, p  0.004) indicated that the systematic error from different scanners was almost linear and could be controlled for in the general linear model. Therefore, DTI images from the two scanners were combined to increase the statistical power of our TBSS analysis by adding a binary categorical variable in the general linear model.",

This automated measurement of WMH volume has shown a high reliability in our previous studies. Briefly, the major steps involved in the automatic detection and measurement of WMH volume are as follows: (1) coregistration of each participants FLAIR images to their corresponding T1-weighted structural images;\n(2) spatial transformation of T2 FLIAR and T1 images into MNI space;\n(3) generation of a brain mask to remove non-brain tissue by segmenting both T1-weighted and FLAIR images into GM, WM and CSF; The overlapping regions between significant FA reduction and WM lesions were highlighted in bold.

The spatially normalized WMH maps were added together and then divided by the number of WMH images to finally create the spatial probability distribution of WM lesions (see Supplementary Figs. 1 and2). In order to account for the variation in the intracranial volume (ICV), an index of WMH burden (a ratio of the total WMH volume against the ICV of the same subject) was considered in the statistical analysis.",

      "text": "One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc analyses were used for the comparisons of continuous variables of the demographic profile, while categorical variables were compared using the Pearson Chi-square test. Standardized z-scores of the FA values for each white matter region of aMCI showing significant difference in FA measure compared with controls (see voxel-wise analysis of group comparisons in FA measures below) were calculated. The z-scores were first entered separately into a series of logistic regression models, together with age, sex, years of education and scanner as control variables, and with diagnostic group as the dependent variable. Those WM regions exhibiting an area under curve (AUC) of 0.65 or greater were retained for further logistic regression analysis.\nThe retained ROIs were entered together into a logistic regression model to examine whether the discrimination accuracy would improve when used in combination. In addition, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to assess the group difference in WMH burden, while controlling for age, sex, and years of education. The relationship between WMH burden and the average skeleton FA values was further evaluated controlling for age, sex, and years of education, using Pearson partial correlation. All these statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software package version 17 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nFor the voxel-wise analysis of group differences in FA between aMCI, naMCI and normal controls, a nonparametric permutation test with 5000 random permutations was performed by using the FSL randomise program. Contrasts of aMCI versus controls, naMCI versus controls, and aMCI versus naMCI, were set up to detect the FA differences, while regressing out the linear effect of age, sex, years of education, and different scanners as covariates of no interest. As an alternative to conventional cluster-based thresholding which is normally compromised by the arbitrary definition of the clusterforming threshold, a recently developed algorithm, known as threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (Smith, 2009) was used to obtain the skeletal voxels significantly different between groups at p b 0.05, after accounting for multiple comparisons by controlling for family-wise error (FWE) rates. From the results of voxel-wise group comparisons, the skeletal regions showing significant between-group differences in FA were located and labeled anatomically by mapping the FWE-corrected statistical map of p b 0.05 to the JHU DTI WM atlas Fig. 2. Significant FA reduction in naMCI (non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment) subjects compared with controls is highlighted in red-yellow and superimposed on the MNI152 template (p b 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we have characterized in vivo WM alterations in aMCI and naMCI. Two recent TBSS (Damoiseaux et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2009) studies have performed preliminary investigation of WM changes in aMCI, but discrepant findings were reported. One study (Damoiseaux et al., 2009) did not reveal any significant FA reduction in aMCI compared with controls, even though their aMCI subjects had more severe cognitive impairment than ours (mean MMSE score 25.9 compared to 28.05 in our aMCI subjects). This is possibly due to their smaller sample size (8 aMCI subjects). By contrast, the other TBSS study (Liu et al., 2009) using 27 aMCI subjects found a significant FA decrease in the right parahippocampal WM, bilateral uncinate fasciculus, and WM in the brain stem and cerebellum, but this finding could not reach a significance level when multiple comparison correction was applied. By using a large sample size of MCI and controls recruited from a community-dwelling non-demented cohort and more stringent statistical analysis, we showed that aMCI subjects had reduced FA in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes WM, together with association fibres including the posterior cingulum, sagittal stratum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontoccipital fasciculus, commissural fibre of the corpus callosum, and projection fibres comprising the corona radiata and thalamic radiation. The anatomical locations of FA reductions in aMCI in our study are mostly consistent with a number of previous DTI studies using ROI and VBM methods (Bai et al., 2009;Cho et al., 2008;Chua et al., 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2005;Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Huang et al., 2007;Lövblad et al., 2004;Medina et al., 2006;Parente et al., 2008;Rose et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2007;Zhou et al., 2008).\nIn the naMCI group, the location of FA reduction overlapped that of the aMCI group to some extent with the additional involvement of the middle frontal WM, precentral WM, supramarginal WM, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and cerebral peduncle. However, significant temporal lobe FA reduction was absent in naMCI. These different patterns of WM deficits in temporal regions are consistent with our understanding of the important role of temporal WM in memory function, which by definition is impaired in aMCI but not naMCI. Therefore, this finding is consistent with the suggestion that aMCI is more likely to represent early AD, whereas naMCI is more heterogeneous in pathology other than AD.\nIn the aMCI group, it was of particular interest to find decreased FA in the medial temporal fornix and posterior cingulum, given the medial temporal lobes and posterior cingulate are two pivotal regions supporting memory function (Dickerson, 2004;Zhou et al., 2008). The fornix is a WM tract connecting the hippocampus with the septal region, mammillary bodies, and prefrontal cortex. Previous DTI studies have found reduced fornix integrity and its association with hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimers disease (DeCarli et al., 2008;Liu et al., 2009;Teipel, 2007). Therefore, the presence of fornix degradation in our aMCI subjects probably stems from Wallerian degeneration secondary to hippocampal atrophy, thus indirectly reflecting hippocampal damage which is a hallmark of AD pathology. More importantly, the disrupted connectivity between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex via fornix can cause memory dysfunction, such as abnormal memory organization and reduced overall episodic memory (Nestor, 2007;Takei et al., 2008). In addition, in animal experiments, it was demonstrated that transection of the fornix in the macaque severely impaired memory acquisition of spatio-temporal information (Buckley, 2008). Therefore, the disruption of fornix found The overlapping regions between significant FA reduction and WM lesions were highlighted in bold. Abbreviations: naMCI: non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment; WM: white matter; L: left; R: right.\nin our study further supports the well-established notion that medial temporal memory system is affected early in the preclinical AD stage (Dickerson, 2004).\nThe posterior cingulum is a WM tract linking the posterior cingulate to the entorhinal cortex which in turn has reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown functional disruption in the posterior cingulate either during the memory cognitive task or in the resting state in aMCI and AD patients (Rombouts, 2005;Yetkin, 2006). Consistent with fMRI findings, a positron emission tomography (PET) study has reported abnormal posterior cingulate hypometabolism by measuring glucose consumption in MCI and AD (Mosconi, 2008). These functional and metabolic abnormalities probably result from the vulnerability of the posterior cingulate to the amyloid deposition (Forsberg, 2008), whose toxicity could cause posterior cingulum degeneration found in the present study. However, it is intriguing that naMCI also demonstrated posterior cingulum abnormality, but without clinical symptom of memory impairment. The abnormalities of the posterior cingulate region in naMCI have been consistently reported by structural and metabolic studies (Chua et al., 2009;Kantarci et al., 2009;Wolk, 2009). One possible explanation for the reduced FA in the posterior cingulate in the absence of clinical manifestation of memory decline is that the compensatory recruitment process may be involved to maintain the memory performance in naMCI (Dickerson and Sperling, 2008).\nA recent ROI study investigating DTI characteristics of aMCI and naMCI showed a disrupted posterior cingulum in both MCI subtypes, but the hippocampal alteration was only evident in aMCI (Kantarci et al., 2009). Our results are consistent with this finding and showed compromised posterior cingulum in aMCI and naMCI but abnormal fornix specific to aMCI. In addition, a recent meta-analysis has reported that hippocampal atrophy, but not posterior cingulate alteration is predictive of conversion of MCI to AD (Schroeter, 2009). Taken together, it is indicated that clinically-evident memory dysfunction and further decline into AD is more likely to arise from the disruption to the medial temporal memory system.\nIt is noteworthy that we did not find significant differences in FA between aMCI and naMCI. One possible explanation is that some individuals in our naMCI subgroup may represent early AD, thus limiting the statistical power to detect WM structural difference between aMCI and naMCI, as a number of epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that not only the aMCI subtype but also the naMCI subtype could progress to AD dementia (Busse, 2006;Fischer, 2007;Rountree et al., 2007). In addition, one recent PET study demonstrated increased level of amyloid-β deposition in naMCI patients, a typical feature of AD (Wolk, 2009). It is also possible that our DTI images were only six directional with low signal-to-noise ratio and may be less sensitive to subtle local differences between these two subtypes of MCI.\nOne of the major manifestations of vascular pathology is white matter hyperintensity which is frequently observed on T2-weighted FLAIR images in MCI and AD (Bigler, 2002) as well as normal ageing (Wen and Sachdev, 2004;Wen et al., 2009). In the present study, the spatial distribution of significant FA reduction to some extent overlapped with the regions of WMH in the frontal, parietal, occipital WM, corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, some of which are localised in the territories supplied by small vessels known as lenticulostriate branches of the cerebral artery (Wen and Sachdev, 2004). The white matter in these arterial territories would be susceptible to insufficient blood supply due to hypoperfusion in the arterioles. Furthermore, WMH burden was found to be significantly increased in the aMCI subjects and inversely correlated with the mean skeleton FA values. This finding is compatible with a previous study demonstrating the association between WMH and decrease of FA values (Jones et al., 1999). Taken together, it is suggested that vascular pathology could lead to loss of white matter integrity. However, it should be noted that some WM areas with reduced FA did not overlap with WM lesions, such as the crus of fornix and temporal white matter in aMCI, implying that other pathological mechanisms may account for compromised WM integrity as measured by the decreased FA value in MCI. Apart from Wallerian degeneration mentioned previously, histological studies have shown that WM deterioration is associated with dementia, by disrupting myelin integrity, reducing axonal and glial cell density, and loss of oligodendrocytes in WM (Bronge, 2002;Englund, 1998;Sjobeck, 2003). In a postmortem study of AD patients, using optical density measurement, Sjobeck and colleagues reported reduced myelin density localised in the frontal, temporal, and parietal areas of the brain (Sjöbeck et al., 2006). Differential myelin characteristics may make the late-myelinating WM areas, like frontal, temporal, temporoparietal cortical WM, and long association fibre more vulnerable to the demyelination process than early-myelinating regions, such as primary motor and occipital cortical WM and projection fibres (Bartzokis, 2004;Stricker et al., 2009).\nWith regard to the diagnostic utility of DTI measures in aMCI, the splenium of corpus callosum and crus of fornix were sensitive discriminators between aMCI and cognitively normal individuals. This finding is partly consistent with our previous research using ROI approach (Chua et al., 2009) which showed that the splenium of corpus callosum and posterior cingulum were the best predictors of aMCI in a subgroup of subjects used in our present study. Unlike our previous report, however, we failed to find any diagnostic value in the posterior cingulum, and instead found the crus of fornix as being discriminating. The discrepancies could be due to different methodologies of DTI analysis. We believe that in the previous report by Chua et al. the posterior cingulate ROI might have included some adjacent WM from the splenium of corpus callosum. In addition, ROI of the fornix was not included in the previous study. The present study extends the gray matter (e.g. hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) morphometry found in previous studies (Bottino, 2002;Chetelat and Baron, 2003;Du, 2001;Pennanen, 2004;Tapiola et al., 2008) to the DTI measure of WM integrity in the diagnosis of MCI. However, we did not find any region which can effectively predict naMCI from controls. This finding was not unexpected, as naMCI is characterized by decline in one of more non-memory cognitive functions (e.g. executive function, visual-spatial function, language), with diverse neuroanatomical underpinnings. Whereas aMCI consistently includes memory dysfunction and the finding of medial temporal lobe abnormalities is thereby understandable, no white matter structure is likely to be consistently abnormal in all naMCI patients.\nThere are some limitations to our study. First, the cross-sectional design cannot determine the potential role of the DTI measure in the prediction of dementia in MCI subjects. Second, DTI performed in our study is only six directional, resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio. Third, DTI images were collected from two scanners, but these were both 3 T Philips scanners and the same protocol was used; we combined the data from the scanners only after demonstrating the comparability of the data from the two scanners. In spite of these limitations, we have detected WM abnormalities of MCI subjects as compared with cognitively normal subjects in a population-based cohort with large sample size, which mostly conform to our hypotheses.\nIn summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study employing tractbased spatial statistics to investigate the global white matter alterations in amnestic MCI and non-amnestic MCI in a large population-based sample. The results provide insight into the similarities and differences of spatial patterns of WM damage in aMCI and naMCI subtypes. The medial temporal WM alteration underlying memory dysfunction was evident in aMCI but not naMCI, supporting the notion that aMCI is more likely to represent early AD dementia. Loss of white matter integrity in MCI could be attributed to either vascular pathology or degenerative process. In addition, DTI measures of the splenium of corpus callosum and fornix are useful biomarker to distinguish aMCI from cognitively normal individuals. Future longitudinal follow-up should examine whether DTI measure of WM integrity can effectively predict MCI patients at high risk of progressing to dementia.",

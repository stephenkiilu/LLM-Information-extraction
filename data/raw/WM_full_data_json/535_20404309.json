    "abstract": "Objective: To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess gray matter and white matter tract diffusion in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SMD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Methods: This was a case-control study where 16 subjects with bvFTD, 7 with PNFA, and 4 with SMD were identified and matched by age and gender to 19 controls. All subjects had 3-T head MRI with a DTI sequence with diffusion encoding in 21 directions. Gray matter mean diffusivity (MD) was assessed using a region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-level approach, and voxel-based morphometry was used to assess patterns of gray matter loss. White matter tract diffusivity (fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity) was assessed by placing ROIs on tracts of interest. Results: In bvFTD, increased gray matter MD and gray matter loss were identified bilaterally throughout frontal and temporal lobes, with abnormal diffusivity observed in white matter tracts that connect to these regions. In SMD, gray matter loss and increased MD were identified predominantly in the left temporal lobe, with tract abnormalities observed in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. In PNFA, gray matter loss and increased MD were observed in left inferior frontal lobe, insula, and supplemental motor area, with tract abnormalities observed in the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusions: The diffusivity of gray matter is increased in regions that are atrophic in frontotemporal dementia, suggesting disruption of the cytoarchitecture of remaining tissue. Furthermore, damage was identified in white matter tracts that interconnect these regions, supporting the hypothesis that these diseases involve different and specific brain networks.

      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently emerged as a valuable technique for assessing structural changes in the brain. 123 It can provide information on microstructural tissue integrity by measuring changes in water diffusion through tissue. This is particularly useful for assessing the integrity of white matter tracts because DTI can provide a measure of the directionality of diffusion (fractional anisotropy FA). However, DTI can also provide a measure of the magnitude of diffusivity (mean diffusivity), which is typically increased in neurodegeneration because of loss of microstructural barriers to diffusion, and can be used to assess the integrity of gray matter.\nThe frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with unique and focal patterns of gray matter atrophy. 4567 These disorders include behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), which is characterized by behavior and personality changes; progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), characterized by phenomic errors and hesitant speech; and semantic dementia (SMD), characterized by naming problems. 8 There is some evidence that bvFTD and SMD are associated with white matter tract degeneration, 910111213 although DTI has not previously been assessed in PNFA, and it is unclear how patterns of tract degeneration differ across these variants.\nThe aim of this study was therefore to assess water diffusivity in white matter tracts and gray matter, and to compare these results with the patterns of gray matter atrophy in bvFTD, SD, and PNFA. We hypothesize that patterns of abnormal gray matter diffusivity will overlap with patterns of atrophy, although this is currently unknown.\nMETHODS Subjects. We identified all subjects (n ϭ 27) from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Alzheimers Disease Research Center (ADRC) or Patient Registry (ADPR) who fulfilled clinical criteria for FTD (16 bvFTD, 7 PNFA, 4 SMD), 8 were recruited between July 2007 and October 2008, and had DTI-MRI. These subjects were frequency-matched by age and gender to 19 normal controls who had been recruited into the ADRC or ADPR. Subject demographics are shown in table 1.\nStandard protocol approvals and consent. Informed consent was obtained for participation in the studies, which were approved by the Mayo Institutional Review Board.",

Maps of FA, color-coded FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA) (equivalent to eigenvector 1), and radial diffusivity (DR) (average of eigenvectors 2 and 3) were computed from these 21 diffusion-weighted images using DtiStudio. 18 To maintain a clear distinction between cortex and tract measurements, MD was assessed in gray matter regions that lack directional diffusion, with FA, DR, and DA assessed in white matter tracts since the diffusion is inherently directional.\nGray matter diffusivity measurements. Gray matter diffusivity was measured using both an atlas-based parcellation and voxel-level analysis. The atlas-based parcellation technique used the automated anatomic labeling (AAL) atlas 19 and SPM5 to generate mean MD values for different regions of interest (ROIs). We analyzed 16 mutually exclusive ROIs covering left and right frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and basal ganglia.\nThe AAL atlas 19 was normalized to a customized template 16 and edited. Each MPRAGE was normalized to the customized template, and the inverse transformation was applied to warp the atlas labels to the subjects native anatomical space (figure e-1 on the Neurology  Web site at www.neurology.org). Each MPRAGE was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF in native space. Next, the MPRAGE of each subject was warped to the b0 image using an in-house modified version of the high-dimensional warping (HDW) toolbox in SPM5. The resulting deformation was applied to the subject-specific atlas, as well as to the segmented images. For each subject, the b0space segmented gray and white matter segmentations were combined to create a binary brain mask. Each subjects brain mask was multiplied by the subject-specific b0-space atlas, to generate a custom atlas for each subject, parcellated into the aforementioned ROIs. The b0-space gray and white matter images were used to perform partial volume correction (PVC) on the MD image, using a 2-compartment PVC algorithm. 20 PVC-corrected MD values were calculated for all gray matter ROIs in the atlas.\nFor the voxel-level analysis, each PVC-corrected MD image was transformed into template space by inverting the deformation obtained for the HDW of each MPRAGE to b0 space, combined with the transformation performed above to normal- ize each MPRAGE into template space. An 8-mm FWHM smoothing filter was applied.\nWhite matter tract diffusivity measurements. Specific white matter tracts were identified using the color-coded FA maps. ROIs were placed on the tracts on the color-coded FA maps using ANALYZE software (Mayo Biomedical Imaging Resource, Rochester, MN) by 1 rater (J.L.W.) blinded to clinical diagnosis. Regions were placed using anatomic landmarks on axial images, but coronal images were viewed simultaneously to guide placement. ROIs were placed on the following tracts (figure 1): genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), splenium of the corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus (UNC) at the vertical position where it connects temporal and frontal lobes, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), anterior cingulate (AC), posterior cingulate (PC), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and the descending corticospinalcorticopontine tracts. The SLF was sampled at 3 positions: anterior descending tracts branching into the inferior frontal lobes, posterior descending tracts branching into posterior temporal lobes, and superior horizontal fibers usually positioned adjacent to the most superior slice of the lateral ventricles. The ILF was sampled at an anterior and posterior position within the temporal lobe. All ROIs were measured separately for the left and right hemispheres, except for the corpus callosum. Once the ROIs had been placed using color-coded FA maps, they were overlaid on FA, DA, and DR maps to calculate tract statistics for each ROI.\nIntrarater reproducibility was assessed by placing ROIs on 20 subjects twice with an interval of 2 weeks. The rater was blinded to ROI placement at time 1 when placing ROIs at time 2.",

We estimated pairwise differences with 95 confidence intervals and performed pairwise hypothesis tests using contrasts from the model. To control the number of false-positive pairwise differences, we applied a false discovery rate (FDR) correction, 22 which controls the proportion of false-positives across the p values for all ROIs for each endpoint. Significance was considered at p Ͻ 0.05 and at trend level to p Ͻ 0.1. If comparisons did not survive correction using FDR, uncorrected p values at p Ͻ 0.05 were reported.\nTo assess gray matter volume and MD at the voxel level, we applied full-factorial models in SPM5 to assess differences between disease groups and controls with age and gender included as covariates.

      "text": "Gray matter voxel-level analyses. Patterns of gray matter volume loss and MD increase are shown in figure 2. The bvFTD group showed bilateral gray matter loss and MD increase throughout the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, with some involvement of the medial and lateral parietal lobes and occipital lobes. The SMD group showed loss and MD increase predominantly in the temporal lobes, particularly on the left, with loss extending into the occipital lobes. The PNFA group showed loss and MD increase in the left posterior inferior and superior frontal lobe, anterior insula, supplemental motor area, and temporal lobe.\nGray matter ROI diffusivity. The ROI-based gray matter results are shown in table e-1. The bvFTD group showed increases in MD across all ROIs, with the most significant increases bilaterally throughout the temporal and frontal lobes, insula, and caudate nucleus. The most significant increases in MD in SMD were observed in left temporal lobe regions, with significant increases also observed in the right temporal lobe, insula, and left-sided frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes and caudate nucleus. No regions of increased MD survived the FDR correction in PNFA; however, there was a trend using uncorrected p values for increased MD in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes and the left supplemental motor area, insula, superior and medial frontal lobes, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and precentral gyrus. Significant differences across disease groups were only identified using uncorrected p values. bvFTD showed greater MD in the right temporal, medial frontal, precentral, and parietal lobes than PNFA; SMD showed greater MD in the left lateral temporal lobe than bvFTD and greater MD in the left temporal lobe, caudate, medial parietal and occipital lobe, and right medial temporal lobe than PNFA.\nWhite matter tract ROI diffusivity. The mean of the within-subject CV 21 estimates across all ROIs was 0.06 (range 0.03-0.10) for FA, 0.06 (0.02-0.13) for DR, and 0.05 (0.03-0.08) for DA.\nWhite matter tract results are shown in table 2, figure 3, and figure e-2. In bvFTD, decreased FA and increased DR were identified in bilateral UNC, AC, anterior SLF, left posterior SLF, and anterior ILF, with altered DR only in the GCC and posterior ILF. Increased FA was observed in the corticospinal tract. The SMD group showed significantly decreased FA and increased DR in the left posterior ILF, UNC, and PC. Increased DR was also found in the left anterior ILF, and decreased FA was found in the left anterior SLF. In contrast to the other groups, PNFA showed the most significant alterations in diffusivity in the SLF, with decreased FA and increased DR in the anterior SLF, and decreased FA in the left posterior and superior SLF and right UNC. No significant alterations in DA were identified in any tracts in any group.\nDifferences across the 3 disease groups were only identified using uncorrected p values; PNFA showed lower FA in the superior SLF than bvFTD, whereas bvFTD showed higher DR in the right anterior ILF than PNFA. SMD showed lower FA and higher DR in the left posterior ILF than both bvFTD and PNFA.\nDISCUSSION This study has demonstrated that FTD is associated with changes in both gray matter and white matter water diffusivity, and that patterns of change differ across the 3 syndromic variants of FTD.\nEarly DTI studies assessing white matter tracts typically reported FA, although more recent studies have moved toward reporting DR and DA, where increases in DR have been interpreted as reflecting loss of myelin integrity 23 and increases in DA represent axonal degeneration. However, it was recently suggested that alignment of the eigenvectors with underlying tissue could be affected by disease pathology, and so this interpretation may not always hold. 24 This criticism of DR and DA does not extend to FA, which is still considered to represent a valid measure of the degree to which water diffusion is directional. Therefore, although we report DR and DA for consistency with previous studies, caution should be exercised in interpreting these data. Tract abnormal-ities were observed in all disease groups, although changes were only identified in FA and DR. bvFTD was associated with widespread patterns of increased gray matter MD, particularly affecting bilateral temporal and frontal lobes, but also the parietal lobes. These changes closely mirrored the patterns of gray matter loss in the same subjects, suggesting a close spatial association between atrophy and increases in water diffusion and showing that the remaining tissue has abnormalities that can be detected using DTI. Patterns of predominantly frontal and temporal gray matter loss are typical for bvFTD. 7,252627 We also identified diffusivity changes in many white matter tracts in bvFTD. These were typically tracts that connected the regions of atrophic brain tissue. Diffusivity changes were identified in tracts located in the frontal lobes, such as the AC, GCC, and anterior SLF, and tracts that connect to the temporal lobes, such as the UNC and ILF. The changes observed in the ILF were particularly severe in anterior portions of the tract, which corresponds to the fact that gray matter loss was most severe in the anterior temporal lobe. However, changes in diffusivity were also identified in more posterior ROIs, such as the posterior SLF, and in the PC. Although bvFTD is typically considered to involve the anterior temporal and frontal lobes, the lateral and medial parietal lobes can be severely affected 27 and usually become affected later in the disease course. It is also possible that our cohort consists of different anatom-ical variants of bvFTD, 27 although we had too few subjects to allow further subdivision. A previous study similarly identified abnormal diffusivity in anterior corpus callosum, AC, and PC, and UNC in subjects with bvFTD, although they did not specifically identify and assess the ILF or SLF. 13 The patterns of gray matter MD increase in SMD similarly matched well with the patterns of tissue loss. Both measures were associated with asymmetric patterns, with the most severe changes observed in the left hemisphere and particularly involving the temporal lobes. This pattern of atrophy is typical of subjects with SMD. 6,7,28,29 Both gray matter loss and MD increases were also observed in the insula, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, with changes worse in the left hemisphere. Changes in white matter tract diffusivity were similarly identified in the left hemi- sphere, with the most significant changes in FA and DR identified in the left anterior and posterior ILF and left UNC, which both connect to the temporal lobes. The ILF seems to be particularly related to SMD because it was involved to a greater degree than in bvFTD and PNFA. The ILF connects the temporal and occipital lobes 30 and has been suggested to play a role in visual object recognition and in linking object representations to their lexical labels. 31 It is also likely that the ROI in the posterior ILF may contain fibers from the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, which has also been implicated in semantic processing, 32 because these tracts overlap to a large degree. Although the UNC, which connects frontal and temporal lobes, has been suggested to be involved in semantic processing, 31 the fact that it was also heavily involved in bvFTD supports the suggestion that it may not be essential for language 33 but may instead be contributing to behavioral dyscontrol, 9 which can be present in both bvFTD and SMD. We also observed some changes in FA in the ROI placed in the left anterior SLF, which is positioned in the SLF as it descends into the inferior frontal lobe. This ROI may contain fibers from the arcuate fasciculus, which has previously been shown to have reduced FA in SMD 9 and has been thought to play a role in language function. 31,34,35 Less severe gray matter changes were observed in PNFA. Increases in gray matter MD and gray matter loss were observed in left inferior and superior frontal lobe, insula, and supplemental motor area. Additional increases were observed in the left orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal lobe, temporal pole, precentral gyrus, and right inferior frontal lobe. Previous studies have consistently found patterns of tissue loss in the inferior frontal lobes and insula in PNFA. 5,29,36,37 The supplemental motor area has been shown to be associated with apraxia of speech (AOS), 5 which is commonly found in patients with PNFA. Interestingly, the tract that showed the most severe changes in FA and DR was the SLF, with involvement of the anterior SLF tracts that descend into the inferior frontal lobes, the posterior SLF tracts that descend into the posterior temporal lobe, and the horizontal superior SLF tracts. In fact, PNFA was the only group to show significantly altered diffusivity in the superior SLF, and there was a trend for PNFA to show significantly lower FA in this tract compared with bvFTD. This result fits with the fact that the greatest regions of atrophy were identified in the inferior frontal lobes and suggests that damage to the SLF may play a role in the language deficits in PNFA. Abnormalities in the SLF have been previously reported in subjects with primary progressive aphasia. 34 However, the superior SLF ROI is also likely to contain tracts that interconnect with motor and premotor regions. 35 It is therefore possible that damage to these tracts contributes to dysarthria and AOS that can be found in PNFA. 5 The presence of AOS is associated with corticobasal degeneration pathology 5 and previous studies of corticobasal syndrome have similarly reported diffusivity changes in the supplemental motor area and frontoparietal fibers, which likely coincide with the superior SLF. 38,39 Detailed speech and language assessments were not available for the subjects in this study, however, and therefore the contribution of these motor problems is presently unclear.\nThis study has demonstrated differences in patterns of gray and white matter diffusion across the syndromic variants of FTD. Not all the results survived correction for multiple comparisons because of small numbers of subjects, but interesting trends were still identified. Damage to certain white matter tracts was relatively disease specific, with the AC and GCC only affected in bvFTD, the ILF preferentially affected in SMD, and the SLF being most heavily affected in PNFA. These abnormal tracts interconnect with the regions of abnormal gray matter in each disease, supporting the hypothesis that these diseases involve different large-scale neural networks. 40",

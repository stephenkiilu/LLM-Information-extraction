    "abstract": "Background: Huntingtons disease is marked by progressive neuroanatomical changes, assumed to underlie the development of the diseases characteristic symptoms. Previous work has demonstrated longitudinal macrostructural white-matter atrophy, with some evidence of microstructural change focused in the corpus callosum. Objective: To more accurately characterise longitudinal patterns, we examined white matter microstructural change using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data from three timepoints over a 15 month period. Methods: In 48 early-stage HD patients and 36 controls from the multi-site PADDINGTON project, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was employed to measure changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 24 white matter regions-of-interest (ROIs). Results: Cross-sectional analysis indicated widespread baseline between-group differences, with significantly decreased FA and increased AD and RD found in HD patients across multiple ROIs. Longitudinal rates of change differed significantly between HD patients and controls in the genu and body of corpus callosum, corona radiata and anterior limb of internal capsule. Change in RD in the body of the corpus callosum was significantly associated with baseline disease burden, but other clinical associations were not significant. Conclusions: We detected subtle longitudinal white matter changes in early HD patients. Progressive white matter abnormalities in HD may not be uniform throughout the brain, with some areas remaining static in the early symptomatic phase. Longer assessment periods across disease stages will help map this progressive trajectory.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) causes progressive neurodegeneration, leading to debilitating motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Despite identification of the gene responsible for HD 1 and subsequent years of concerted clinical and research efforts, the search for disease-modifying treatments is still in its infancy.\nStudying HD in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful approach for improving our understanding of the diseases progressive nature. Used to elucidate aspects of the neural pathogenesis of HD in the striatum, studies using volumetric approaches have also shown that HD pathology extends to macrostructural abnormalities within cortical and white matter regions 23456. By employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we can similarly investigate microstructural changes in white matter with several studies already having identified abnormalities in manifest HD gene-carriers 7891011, pre-manifest HD (preHD) gene carriers 121314151617 and across multiple disease stages 5,18192021222324252627282930.\nCross-sectional DTI studies which have included both preHD and early-HD gene-carriers have attempted to characterise disease progression, but this is better achieved by conducting longitudinal analyses which can map individual patterns of change. There is strong evidence of progressive macrostructural white matter degeneration 313233343536373839 and current evidence suggests that longitudinal change in caudate nucleus volume is a particularly promising candidate neuroimaging biomarker for future clinical trials 36. If the microstructural properties captured by DTI are more sensitive to the cellular processes underlying neurodegeneration 40, DTI may potentially be a better index of HD progression than macrostructural volumetric methods. Thus, further longitudinal DTI analysis of white matter in HD is warranted. However, only a limited number of studies have examined DTI in HD longitudinally (see Rees et al., for review 41) and these have generally either been restricted to striatal grey matter regions 42,43, or limited in sample size and scope. For example, white matter change was investigated in a small combined group (N  7) of early HD and preHD gene carriers using whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) 44,45. This preliminary research identified longitudinal decreases in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) after one year in the HD patients when compared to a matched control group. Conversely, Sritharan and colleagues 46 were unable to detect similar changes over the same interval, using a region-of-interest (ROI) approach in a larger sample of 18 HD patients and 17 controls. However, this analysis only examined mean diffusivity (MD) of the corpus callosum. A recent study has investigated longitudinal change over 18 months using data from two timepoints in a larger group of preHD and early HD gene-carriers 29. Again, using TBSS, they have shown that when compared to both preHD and control groups, early HD gene-carriers have reduced FA in the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum and mid cingulum over 18 months and that callosal FA levels are predicted by the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS) 47 at baseline. Furthermore, there was evidence of increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the corpus callosum, cingulum, internal capsule and striatal projections over 18 months when compared to the premanifest, but not the control group.\nAnother recent study applying histogram analysis to DTI data over 24 months using data from two timepoints, assessed microstructural properties of whole-brain gray matter, white matter and the striatum in different stages of HD 30. In that study evidence was found for alterations in cross-sectional diffusion profiles between early manifest HD and preHD subjects compared to healthy controls, without evidence for longitudinal differences in the degree of diffusivity change between the groups. Investigating the structural connectome using the same dataset by applying graph theoretical analysis, Odish and colleagues revealed longitudinal differences between early manifest HD, preHD subjects and controls in various network measures 48. These results further emphasise the importance of exploring different analytical approaches to study the biomarker potential of diffusion MRI.\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate progressive alterations in white matter microstructure during the early stages of symptomatic HD using multisite DTI data combined with an ROI approach. To more clearly characterise longitudinal change, we used three timepoints over a 15 month interval to investigate potential non-linear changes in progression across this period. We focussed on FA as a measure of the direction of diffusivity, in addition to both AD and RD which respectively index water movement parallel and perpendicular to the main fibre. We investigated white matter changes with respect to genetic factors (i.e. CAG repeat length) and disease burden, as these markers of HD show associations with cross-sectional white matter abnormalities 8,23,24 and in using the ROI approach, this analysis was designed to highlight specific brain regions for future evaluation as DTIderived biomarkers for potential therapeutic studies.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "61 HD patients and 40 control participants were recruited as part of the PADDINGTON study 11 across four study sites (Leiden, Netherlands; London, UK; Paris, France; Ulm, Germany). Participants attended three separate study visits, with an initial baseline and subsequent 6-month and 15-month follow-ups. Due to a combination of participant dropout, missing data and quality control failure, 17 participants (13 HD patients, 4 controls) did not have complete diffusion MRI datasets for all three visits (two missing 6-month assessment; 15 missing 15month); hence 84 participants (48 HD patients and 36 controls -see Table 1) were included in the final analysis. These exclusions were necessary as the longitudinal image registration scheme outlined below cannot account for missing image data. Excluded HD patients had marginally higher disease burden and Total Motor Score (TMS) and lower Total Functional Capacity (TFC) at baseline but overall the demographic differences were minimal (see Supplementary Table 1).\nIn addition to MRI data, behavioural, cognitive and clinical assessments were performed at each visit. All patients had received a diagnosis of manifest HD, were at disease stage I 49 and had a baseline UHDRS TFC score between 11-13. One patient had a TFC score of 9 and was classified as disease stage II (this score remained stable across all study visits). CAG repeat length was assessed to confirm diagnosis and all patients had between 39-54 repeats. Control participants were spouses, partners or gene-negative siblings of the HD patients. Inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years of age, no diagnosis of psychiatric or other neurological disorders, not currently taking part in other pharmacological research and no contraindication to MRI scanning. The respective local ethical committees for each study site approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.",

For the Siemens Allegra (Ulm), parameters were as above except TE  2.81 ms, flip angle  9  and a slice thickness of 1.1 mm. For the Philips Achieva scanner (Leiden) T1weighted magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans were acquired with the following parameters: TR  7.7 ms, TE  3.5 ms, flip angle  8  , FOV  24 cm, matrix size  224  224, yielding 164 sagittal slices to cover the entire brain with a slice thickness of 1.0 mm with no inter-slice gap.\nDTI Imaging Parameters: For the Siemens Tim Trio (London) DTI data were acquired using an EPI For further details on acquisition parameters and pooling of multi-site site data see our previous work on this sample 11,50. Visual quality control was performed to check for acquisition protocol compliance, artefacts and head positioning. Rescans were requested for four participants and scans were excluded due to failure to meet the required quality criteria, leaving 84 participants for the analysis. All image processing and analysis was performed blinded to participant diagnosis. All site effects were modelled within the analysis.",

      "text": "Diffusion-weighted images were initially registered to the corresponding b0 reference image to correct for motion and eddy current distortions, with updates applied to the gradient scheme accordingly. Subsequently, a non-linear least-squares method was used to fit the tensor at each voxel, using Camino 51. Tensor-based registration was then performed using DTI-TK (http:dti-tk.sourceforge.net) 52. This offers improvements over conventional scalar-based registration as it incorporates information from local fibre orientations and has been shown to improve the sensitivity of DTI metrics to microstructural group differences 53,54 and the performance of study-specific atlas generation 55. We employed a well-established specific longitudinal registration procedure, which registers average within-subject templates to a studyspecific group template; this avoids biases caused by asymmetric image registration or imbalanced application of interpolation schemes 56 (see Fig. 1). In short, for every participant, tensor images for each visit were co-registered together to form a bootstrap template, then each image was non-linearly registered to the template using an iterative approach. The resulting affine and non-linear registrations were then combined so that the input images could be mapped to subject-template space in one interpolation step 57. A group template was then created using this same iterative affine and non-linear procedure; with participant average images as input. Again, transformations were combined to take within-participant template images to group template space with one interpolation. This resulted in all participants tensor images being spatially normalised to a study-specific group template, from which individual subject maps for FA, AD and RD could be generated for further processing and statistical analysis.",

Based on our previous work 59, the number of regions was reduced from 48 to 24 to include only those with high test-retest reliability for FA, AD and RD (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient  0.8) (Tables 2 and3). It should be noted that the current sample includes the subsample reported in 59. However, the analysis in that study used sequentially acquired data from a single visit, not multiple timepoints, and therefore presents no confound when using that data to inform the selection of ROIs for the present study. The DTI-81 atlas was registered to the group FA template using the Nifty-Toolkit (http:sourceforge.netprojectsniftyreg) components Aladin, for affine registration 60 and F3D, for nonlinear refinement 61. The computed transformation was then used to warp the label files to match the group FA template. The group FA template was thresholded at FA  0.2 and below-threshold voxels removed from DTI-81 label images in group-template space. The mean value of each metric (FA, AD and RD) was then calculated across each ROI for each participant at each visit. (A) Within-subject registration performed on tensor images using an initial affine and subsequent non-linear step in DTI-TK to warp images from each visit to a within-subject mid-space. A within-subject average template was then generated. (B) These within-subject average images were registered together, again using DTI-TK, to define a longitudinal between-subject space. The initial input images were then warped to this between-subject space and averaged to form a longitudinal group template, specific to the study. (C) Using NiftyReg to calculate affine and non-linear registrations, the FA image from the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas was then warped to match the group template. The parameters of this registration were then applied to ICBM-DTI-81 labels. (D) Finally, subject and visit specific metrics for each ROI were calculated.",

      "text": "All analysis was conducted in STATA version 13. The repeated measures of each ROImetric combination were separately analysed using generalised least squares regression models, with outcome variance (and correlations between pairs of measures) allowed to differ both by disease group and by visit. The models included a group factor (HD patient or Control), time from baseline (in days) and a quadratic term that modelled non-linear change over the three visits. Also, baseline covariates of age, sex and study site were included. Interaction terms between time (both linear and quadratic) and all other variables were included. The primary measures of interest were between-group differences at baseline and in change over 15 months. Due to the large number of ROIs and ensuing increased risk of false positives, a correction for multiple testing was carried out using a procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) 62 at 5. It was considered appropriate to do this for each metric separately, thus corrections were based on analysing 24 ROIs. Due to a priori concern of between-site differences, two interaction terms were tested using the same multiple comparison procedure as above: baseline interaction between group and study site, three-way site by group by time (both linear and quadratic) interaction. If the three-way interaction was significant, then both the baseline group differences and the between-group difference in 15-month change were reported by site. If only the baseline interaction between site and group was significant, this was retained in the model and a single between-group difference in 15-month change reported (non-significant three-way interactions were removed for clarity). If neither interaction was statistically significant they were both removed from the model. FDR correction for the primary measures of interest was conducted after removal of any measures that needed to be reported as site-specific.",

For simplicity, a linear regression was used to model 15-month change with an adjustment for the baseline diffusion value. Additional adjustments were also made for age, sex and study site. Again, interaction between group and site were investigated, and if significant, site-specific associations were presented. If not, the interaction was removed from the model. As above, p-values were adjusted using FDR correction at 5, this time based on the number of measures carried through to the secondary analysis.",

The genu and body of the corpus callosum showed reduced FA and increased RD, with increased AD in the genu only. There was increased RD and AD in the left anterior corona radiata; and increases in AD were also evident in both the right superior corona radiate and anterior limb of internal capsule. All differences were significant following multiple correction. Four metrics showed evidence of interaction between group differences in 15-month change and site (see Supplementary Table 2). Overall, there was little evidence of nonlinear change over the 15 month period, with only limited differences within the HD group.\nIf between-group differences were driven by disease, we would expect to see a relatively flat trajectory of DTI measures over time for the control group, coupled with a deterioration in HD subjects to reflect disease progression. As an informal check, we plotted the model-estimated trajectories of diffusivity measures throughout the study period in controls and HD groups separately. Fitted values are shown for hypothetical participants age 50, with a 5050 malefemale split and a 25 contribution from each site (Fig. 3). Examination of the example trajectories highlighted FA in the genu of corpus callosum, AD in the anterior limb of internal capsule and right superior corona radiata and RD in the left anterior corona radiata as consistent with this pattern. The longitudinal trajectory in other regions indicated a possible regression to the mean in controls influencing the detected group differences in change over time.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Early-stage HD gene-carriers show progressive changes in white matter microstructure in a number of key tracts when compared with healthy, age-matched controls. Using multi-site data, we have demonstrated widespread cross-sectional differences in diffusivity at baseline between controls and early stage HD, with differences in longitudinal change in a number of key tracts including the genu and body of corpus callosum, left anterior corona radiata, right superior corona radiata and right anterior limb of internal capsule. Our cross-sectional findings at baseline concur with previous work using the current cohort 11 and much of the previous DTI research examining white matter in early-stage HD, which demonstrated abnormali-ties in the corpus callosum 18,19,24,27,63 and more widely throughout the brain 5, 7-10, 20-23, 26, 28, 30. We have also shown longitudinal change in the corpus callosum, corona radiate, and right anterior internal capsule across a series of DTI metrics, which supports evidence from previous longitudinal studies 29,45. Weaver et al., for example, identified FA decreases at follow-up in the corpus callosum, internal capsule and corona radiate. Most significantly, however, the recent longitudinal study by Poudel et al. demonstrated that the most robust white matter changes in manifest HD occur within the corpus callosum 29. Both the current study and that of Poudel have shown that in early HD there are FA increases and RD decreases in the corpus callosum when compared with controls. Although this previous study used only two timepoints, incorporating a longer period of change, and a whole-brain rather than an a priori hypothesis driven method, findings are still highly consistent regarding the corpus callosum. These three studies highlight a consistent disturbance within the corpus callosum above all other white matter tracts. This is compatible with the aforementioned extant evidence at the cross-sectional level which robustly demonstrates white matter abnormalities within the corpus callosum. Despite concordance concerning measures of RD and FA, there is far greater inconsistency in terms of AD measures. We saw increased AD not only in the corpus callosum, but also the anterior and superior corona radiate and the anterior internal capsule. Weaver, however, reported decreased AD in a small set of voxels 45, these differences likely due to low statistical power and variability in terms of disease progression; while Poudel et al. did not show any significant differences in AD at all 29. Cross-sectional studies of early HD patients have previously shown increases in AD compared with controls 7,11,18,27,30 and there is evidence that the negative correlation between AD and RD acts as an independent predictor of HD disease progression. However, given the limited number of studies examining longitudinal change in white matter, further replication of our findings would be required to confirm the increases in AD in early HD gene-carriers. It is important to note that some longitudinal differences may potentially be driven by a regression to the mean in controls, rather than being explicitly disease-related. Nevertheless, some regions do appear to show a consistent trajectory of change in early HD patients, while those of the controls remaining static (e.g. genu FA, right anterior limb of internal capsule AD, right superior corona radiata AD, left anterior corona radiata RD).\nInferring specific biological processes underlying alterations in DTI metrics can be contentious 64. Animal studies combining DTI and histology to model white matter damage 65,66 and HD specifically 67 have indicated that differing pathological processes may underlie AD and RD measurements. Under this assumption, RD increases reflect demyelination 68, while changes in AD are more complex and time-dependent. Decreases in AD are thought to occur in response to acute axonal damage and inflammation 69; conversely AD increases reflect expanded extra-cellular spaces resulting from Wallerian degeneration and other more gross atrophic processes 70,71. However, we would caution against the over-interpretation of instances where, for example, AD was significant and RD was not. Cellular modifications caused by HD pathology undoubtedly affect white matter, but the mechanisms underlying this are unclear. Elements of intrinsic axonal degeneration, altered fibre coherence or configuration due to inflammation, decreased axonal density or demyelination all occur during the progression of HD and current DTI methods lack such aetiological specificity. More recent developments in diffusion MRI 7273747576, may be more aetiologically-informative regarding microstructural white matter changes occurring during HD progression.\nAnalysis of clinical associations found a relationship between DBS and change in RD in the body of corpus callosum, with greater disease burden at baseline related to greater increases in RD over 15 months during the early stages of manifest HD. Again, it is the corpus callosum that is most significantly targeted and, notwithstanding the aforementioned caveats, this may reflect on-going demyelination in the corpus callosum of the more severe patients, in line with previous evidence for corpus callosum abnormalities in early HD 18,19,24,27,63. The number of associations between DTI metrics and clinical measures that did not reach statistical significance was however, unexpectedly high. Poudel et al also found that when correlating FA with a series of clinical measures, only UHDRS-TMS scores were significant predictors of white matter microstructural changes 29, illustrating the potential difficulty in demonstrating clear relationships between clinical measures and longitudinal neuroimaging metrics. While this has been achieved using robust volumetric methods 363738, issues regarding signal-to-noise ratio, reliability and validity hinder both DTI and many clinical measures and detecting associations may be better achieved by adopting novel diffusion-imaging techniques or by combining multiple imaging modalities with clinical data in a multivariate framework.\nCombining data from multiple scanners can present limitations, however our previous work has demonstrated that the cross-site pooling of data does not introduce bias in DTI analyses 50. Furthermore, longitudinal within-participant change measures were not confounded by scanner differences. Our study did not model any potentially confounding effects of medication on white matter metrics. However, given the considerable heterogeneity in medication usage among the participants, it would not have been practical to test medication effect formally.\nIn conclusion, patients in the early stages of clinically-manifest HD show robust abnormalities in white matter structure throughout the brain, most robustly in the corpus callosum. Moreover, some of those regions appear to be undergoing microstructural degeneration as the disease progresses during the early diagnosed stages, with some evidence for a relationship between disease burden and structure of the corpus callosum. Despite these findings, our results demonstrate the difficulties in mapping effects of clinical variables onto a dynamically and heterogeneous pattern of brain changes that take place during early HD. Novel diffusion imaging methods which provide more information regarding the biological underpinnings of changes in white matter microstructure are required to further understand the heterogeneity of such alterations within HD. Furthermore, the use of multivariate modelling, which incorporates both imaging and clinical data, will also help to understand how white matter changes are related to clinical symptoms.",

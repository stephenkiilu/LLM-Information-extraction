    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment is a nonmotor complication in Parkinsons disease (PD) that have a high risk of developing dementia. White matter is associated with cognitive function in PD and the alterations may occur before the symptoms of the disease. Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies lacked specificity to characterize the concrete contributions of distinct white matter tissue properties. This may lead to inconsistent conclusions about the alteration of white matter microstructure. Here, we used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and white matter fiber clustering method to uncover local white matter microstructures in PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). This study included 23 PD-MCI and 20 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 21 healthy controls (HC). To probe specific and finegrained differences, metrics of NODDI and DTI in white matter fiber clusters were evaluated using along-tract analysis. Our results showed that PD-MCI patients had significantly lower neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) in white matter fiber clusters in the prefrontal region. Correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the diagnostic performance of NODDI-derived metrics in cingulum bundle (2 clusters) and thalamo-frontal (2 clusters) were superior to DTI metrics. Our study provides a more specific insight to uncover local white matter abnormalities in PD-MCI, which benefit understanding the underlying mechanism of cognitive decline in PD and predicting the disease in advance.",

      "text": "Cognitive impairment is a frequent nonmotor complication in Parkinsons disease (PD) and is increasingly being recognized as a component of the disease (Aarsland et al., 2017). Approximately 30 of PD patients exhibit mild cognitive impairment at an early disease stage and have a higher risk of developing dementia than the general population, thus adversely affecting the quality of daily life (Halliday et al., 2008;Monastero et al., 2018). Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and the loss of striatal dopaminergic terminals is considered the hallmark neuropathological finding of PD (Rudow et al., 2008). Yet white matter changes are closely related to cognitive impairment and have potentially more sensitive to early processes in PD (Burke  OMalley, 2013). At present, the underlying mechanism of PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is still a matter of debate.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive technique in vivo that has been widely used to probe microstructural changes in the white matter of PD patients by measuring the diffusivity of water molecules within the brain tissues (Cochrane  Ebmeier, 2013). Previous DTI studies comparing PD-MCI with healthy controls (HC) and PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) have demonstrated white matter microstructure alterations in several important regions (Agosta et al., 2014;Hattori et al., 2012;Inguanzo et al., 2021). Concretely, these studies have shown decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the anterior and superior corona radiata, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, and cingulum in PD-MCI patients when compared with HC. These major tracts are strongly related to cognitive, motor, memory, and emotional functions (Cousineau et al., 2017). Nevertheless, other studies also have inconsistent results that there was no alteration of FA or even an increase in frontal areas (Duncan et al., 2016;Shin et al., 2016). While DTI-derived indices are sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter, they lack specificity.\nFor example, a decrease in FA and an increase in MD may be attributed to reduced neurite density, increased orientation dispersion, and demyelination (Jones et al., 2013). Additionally, the DTI model assumes that water molecule diffusion follows a Gaussian distribution may not be appropriate. Water molecules in actual living tissue are restricted by cell membranes and organelles, thereby exhibiting a non-Gaussian distribution (Kamagata et al., 2016).\nTo overcome these limitations, multi-compartment models were proposed based on acquiring multi-shell diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) data to probe more specific tissue characteristics with different diffusion signals (Alexander et al., 2019;Novikov et al., 2019).\nNeurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) is one of these novel approaches that decomposes signals from three compartments (intracellular, extracellular, and cerebrospinal fluid) in each voxel (Zhang et al., 2012). NODDI parameters, including neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI), provide better specific insights into quantifying white matter microstructure changes. NDI reflects the density of neurites by restricted diffusion and ODI reflects the variability of neurite orientation in white matter (Zhang et al., 2012). Previous studies have demonstrated that NODDI may be a potential biomarker of white matter microstructure changes in PD with complications, such as levodopainduced dyskinesia, neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, and impulse control behaviors (Andica et al., 2020;Ogawa et al., 2021;Takeshige-Amano et al., 2022). Yet most studies were analyzed by averaging all voxel information of a region of interest (ROI) or entire fiber tract.\nThe main limitation of analyzing the properties of the whole white matter tract is that it may conceal potentially valuable information about microstructural abnormalities in local regions within the tract (Lynch et al., 2020). An automatically annotated fiber clustering method was presented to divide whole-brain fibers into fiber clusters with anatomical meanings (ODonnell  Westin, 2007;ODonnell et al., 2012). This white matter parcellation method has been demonstrated to be applicable in different subjects, such as patients with brain tumors (ODonnell et al., 2017), autism (Zhang, Savadjiev, et al., 2018), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Zhang, Wu, et al., 2018), and major depressive disorder (Wu et al., 2018). In addition, along-tract approach can characterize alterations in white matter properties at each location along with the fiber cluster. Combining these methods may provide a better understanding of subtle white matter changes in PD patients with cognitive decline.\nIn the present study, we aimed to characterize local white matter microstructural alterations of PD-MCI patients. We utilized a white matter fiber clustering method and NODDI model to investigate the property abnormalities in subregions of white matter tracts. The relationships between these white matter properties and clinical cognitive scores were also evaluated. Furthermore, we analyzed the performance of different metrics in the specific fiber clusters for the diagnosis of disease.",

The sequence parameters were as follows: TE  89 ms, TR  3230 ms, slice thickness  1.5 mm, flip angle  78, FoV  230 mm  230 mm , multiband acceleration factor  4, voxel size  1.5  1.5  1.5 mm 3 , and 90 diffusion sensitizing gradient directions (30 at b  1000 s mm 2 , 27 at b  2000 smm 2 , and 33 at b  3000 smm 2 ) with six no diffusion weighted (b0) images interspersed throughout the acquisition.",

We acquired the merged b0 volume with reversed phase encoding directions, and then a fieldmap was created using TOPUP (Andersson et al., 2003) for susceptibility-induced distortion correction. All raw images were then separately preprocessed using the EDDY tool (Andersson  Sotiropoulos, 2016), including susceptibility, eddy current distortions and motion artifacts. The b-vectors were rotated using the rotation component of the transformation obtained from the eddy correction process. Nonbrain voxels were masked out by applying BET (Smith, 2002) to the b0 image. NODDI metrics were estimated per voxel from preprocessed multi-shell DWIs using the AMICO framework, which had been proven to accelerate the speed of fitting the NODDI model without notably impacting accuracy (Daducci et al., 2015). In NODDI model, tissue water and diffusion signal are partitioned into three compartments: (1) the intra-cellular compartment (bounded by the membrane of neurites) is modeled as a set of cylinders of zero radius, (2) the extra-cellular compartment (around the neurites including glial cells and cell bodies) is modeled with Gaussian anisotropic diffusion, and (3) the cerebrospinal fluid compartment (occupied by cerebrospinal fluid) is modeled as isotropic Gaussian diffusion (Zhang et al., 2012). The metrics were finally calculated including NDI and ODI.",

A prerequisite for probabilistic tractography was fiber orientation distributions (FODs) were computed using the Multi-Shell Multi-Tissue Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (MSMT-CSD) algorithm, which was performed based on the response functions of white matter obtained before (Jeurissen et al., 2014). The parameters used for tracking were: maximum angle between steps  22.5, minimum length  10 mm, maximum length  250 mm, FOD amplitude cutoff  0.06, and other values were default. One million streamlines were first generated and filtered to approximately 500,000 streamlines.\nAll streamlines in the whole-brain tractography were divided into clusters by using whitematteranalysis package (github.com Slice rDMRI white matte ranal ysis). An anatomically curated parcellation atlas was pre-provided, which was used to achieve white matter fiber segmentation across populations. We registered tractography data of all subjects into the common atlas coordinate system via an unbiased multi-subject affine and bspline tractography registration.

According to the study focusing on PD with dementia, alteration of prefrontal white matter and genu of the CC was associated with cognitive impairment (Kamagata et al., 2013). In a resting-state fMRI study, PD-MCI patients exhibited connectivity dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex was associated with cognitive impairment compared with HC (Amboni et al., 2015). Indeed, the frontal cortex is associated with executive function, attention, working memory, and learning.\nAlthough there was no significant correlation found between NDI and cognitive performance in this study, PD-MCI patients exist axonal loss in these fiber clusters that are related to cognitive function.\nOur finding also shows that axon loss occurred primarily in anterior white matter clusters of the PD-MCI patients, which partially supports the fact that PD pathology progresses occurred from the anterior aspects of the brain (Figure 8). The similar finding was also detected in the TBSS results, which confirms the results of the along-tract analysis (Figure 1). We speculate that axonal loss of these white matter fiber clusters in the anterior brain may predict the risk of cognitive impairment in PD patients.\nThe ODI was also significantly lower in the white matter clusters of CC1 (2 clusters), CC2 (4 clusters), CB (3 clusters), TF (10 clusters), UF (1 cluster), and SLF-II (1 cluster) in PD-MCI patients compared to HC. We found that both NDI and ODI decreased in TBSS results and along-tract results, which is similar to other reports on Alzheimers disease (Fu et al., 2020;Slattery et al., 2017). Orientation dispersion is sensitive to characterizing microstructural information in the crossing fibers and susceptible to axonal organization (Tariq et al., 2016). In the case two clusters of fibers are crossing in a voxel and only one degenerates, the ODI will exhibit a decrease. This decrease may be the outcome of selective neurodegeneration. Due to axonal loss of secondary fibers in crossing fibers, resulting in more aligned neurons in primary clusters, the connectivity of fibers exhibits a tight coherence (Slattery et al., 2017).\nAlthough subtle, our findings demonstrate that PD-MCI patients exhibited lower ODI in left SLF-I (cluster-482) compare to PD-NC patients. SLF connects the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes and is involved in the functions of the frontal area, such as attention and working memory (Yu et al., 2015). The white matter alterations in SLF of PD patients with cognitive impairment have been found in previous studies (Hattori et al., 2012;Kamagata et al., 2012Kamagata et al., , 2013)). SLF was often investigated as a whole in the past but recently was analyzed in three separate components with respective functions. SLF-I is an isolated frontoparietal long association fiber located medial to the CC medial and above the CB, which has functional similarities to the CB primarily involving attentional functions (Nakajima et al., 2020). We suggest that white matter microstructural abnormalities in SLF-I are closely related to cognitive function, and may be a potential imaging marker for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in PD patients in the future.\nFurthermore, we also found that the ODI in left CB (cluster-313; cluster-631) and right TF (cluster-687 and cluster-688) were positively correlated with clinical cognitive scores. The CB is a crucial tract of white matter fibers associated with deficits in memory and visual processing, connecting the prefrontal, parietal and temporal lobes. The TF carries fibers from the thalamic nuclei to the prefrontal cortex, which is related to cognitive function, especially executive function (Bhalsing et al., 2015). The disruption of the white matter microstructure of these fiber clusters indicates a cognitive decline in PD patients. Although the correlation coefficients are moderate, our results also further confirm previous findings on the critical role of CB and TF in the cognition of PD patients (Chondrogiorgi et al., 2019;Kamagata et al., 2012).\nNotably, many studies showed PD-MCI patients have a lower FA in the abnormal white matter tracts than PD-NC patients or HC, while others found no alteration of FA (Agosta et al., 2014;Duncan et al., 2016;Inguanzo et al., 2021). In this study, TBSS analysis found no changes in FA and along-tract analysis found the FA was increased.\nWe found the FA may less sensitive than NODDI to detect abnormal white matter clusters. As mentioned before, NODDI metrics could interpret different underlying microstructural changes of FA, which make more specific inferences about the white matter abnormalities.\nA specific value of FA can be achieved by different combinations of NDI and ODI. For instance, two different white matter regions may obtain the same FA if both the NDI and ODI of them are lower, resulting in changes in FA that are not observed (Slattery et al., 2017).\nTaken together, our results indicate that NODDI is not only specific and superior to DTI in the clinical detection of cognitive impairment.\nThere are limitations in the present study. First, the relatively small sample size might impact the accuracy of the results. Because of this, we strictly checked the image quality and excluded subjects with severe artifacts before data processing. In the future, we will recruit more volunteers to extend our sample size for increase the validity of the study. Second, the lack of histopathological validation limits our interpretation of the findings. Third, NODDI is an estimated model for probing microstructural changes in brain tissue, but the actual situation in brain organization may be more complex.",

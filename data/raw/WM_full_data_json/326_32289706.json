    "abstract": "Background: In healthy subjects (HS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) demonstrated an increase in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes during specific linguistic tasks. This finding indicates functional connections between speech-related cortical areas and the dominant primary motor cortex (M1). Objective: To investigate M1 function with TMS and the speech-related cortical network with neuroimaging measures in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfv-PPA) and the behavioral variant of FTD (bv-FTD). Methods: M1 excitability changes during specific linguistc tasks were examined using TMS in 24 patients (15 with nfv-PPA and 9 with bv-FTD) and in 18 age-matched HS. In the same patients neuroimaging was used to assess changes in specific white matter (WM) bundles and grey matter (GM) regions involved in language processing, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Results: During the linguistic task, M1 excitability increased in HS, whereas in FTD patients it did not. M1 excitability changes were comparable in nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in the superior and inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi. Moreover, VBM disclosed GM volume loss in the left frontal operculum though not in the parietal operculum or precentral gyrus. Furthermore, WM and GM changes were comparable in nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. There was no correlation between neurophysiological and neuroimaging changes in FTD. Atrophy in the left frontal operculum correlated with linguistic dysfunction, assessed by semantic and phonemic fluency tests. Conclusion: We provide converging neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence of abnormal speechrelated cortical network activation in FTD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous degenerative disorder including a behavioral variant (bv-FTD), characterized by prominent behavioral and executive symptoms, and variants manifesting with progressive language deterioration, as the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfv-PPA) 1,2. Several neuroimaging studies have shown structural grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) degeneration, and altered resting-state functional connectivity in specific frontotemporal brain regions in FTD. In particular, structural and functional changes involved fronto-insular, temporal, and limbic regions in bv-FTD patients, whereas nfv-PPA was characterized by abnormalities in frontotemporal networks associated with language function 3e10.\nLanguage requires a complex interaction between functionallyintegrated brain regions, including the primary motor cortex (M1), that mainly subserve expressive functions 11,12. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies performed in healthy subjects (HS) demonstrated a functional connection between speechrelated cortical areas and the dominant M1. During specific linguistic tasks M1 excitability increases, reflecting the speech-related cortical network activation 13e19.\nNo studies have used TMS to investigate speech-related cortical network activation in FTD or compared possible neurophysiological changes in nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. Moreover, none have clarified whether possible TMS abnormalities during a linguistic task reflect structural changes in WM bundles and GM regions involved in language processing in the same patient subgroups.\nIn this study, we investigated the speech-related network activation in FTD patients and HS using a modified version of the TMS protocol described by Tokimura et al. (1996) 13. This protocol entails assessing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single TMS pulses over the dominant and non-dominant M1 during nonlinguistic and linguistic tasks, including reading single words aloud 13. We then compared the neurophysiological results in nfv-PPA patients with those in bv-FTD. As approximately 20 of FTD patients may also manifest clinical signs of Parkinsonism 20, which is known to affect intrinsic M1 activity 21,22, we also compared responses in patients with and without Parkinsonism. Another relevant issue is the possible pathophysiological link between alterations in speech-related cortical network activation and the structural changes in associative WM bundles and GM regions involved in language processing. Hence, we examined possible WM changes, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in specific language-related tracts (temporal part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus), and possible GM structural changes, by using voxel based morphometry (VBM), in specific speech-related cortical areas of the dominant hemisphere (left frontal operculum, left precentral gyrus and left parietal operculum). Finally, to clarify the pathophysiological link between neurophysiological and neuroimaging changes in FTD, we assessed the correlations between language-related M1 excitability changes and structural WM and GM neuroimaging measures.\nOur main hypothesis is that FTD patients are characterized by abnormal language-related M1 excitability as well as WM and GM degeneration in language-related structures, with significant correlation between neurophysiological and neuroimaging measures. We also expect that the aforementioned abnormalities will be prominent in nfv-PPA compared to bv-FTD. Clarifying these points would shed light on the pathophysiology of language dysfunction in FTD.",

All the participants were righthanded and native Italian speakers. The diagnosis of probable bv-FTD and of imaging-supported nfv-PPA was based on recent international consensus criteria 1,23. MRI and FDG-PET revealed patterns of atrophy and hypometabolism that were consistent with a diagnosis of FTD and the respective clinical variants in all the patients 1,23,24. The neurological examination excluded signs of upper or lower motor neuron involvement, while EMG excluded lower motor neuron involvement. At the time of the experiment, 6 patients were being treated with memantine at 10 mgday while the remaining patients were not taking any drugs that act on the central nervous system 25.

Visual cues generated through dedicated software (E-Prime 2 Professional, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA, USA) consisted in four different linguistic and non-linguistic tasks: 1) in the reading aloud task, subjects were instructed to read single words aloud (high-frequency, two-syllable Italian nouns, e.g. casa) as soon as they appeared at the centre of the computer screen; 2) in the silent reading task, they were required to read a similar set of words in silence; 3) in the syllabic phonation task, subjects had to overtly articulate the sequence bababa as soon as a black circle appeared on the screen; 4) the only non-linguistic task consisted in passively viewing a set of abstract meaningless figures consisting of non-letter strings that matched the letters of the words in font size but did not resemble them in shape (non-letter string task) (Fig. 1). During the linguistic tasks, subjects were instructed to produce a constant voice intensity (80e90 dB) that was tested by means of a sound meter. M1 excitability was assessed during both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks by delivering single TMS pulses to the dominant and non-dominant M1 600 ms after the onset of a visual stimulus (word, non-letter string figure or black circle) 15,17e19. Twelve MEPs were recorded at baseline from each FDI muscle and then during each task. The order in which the tasks were evaluated and of the dominant and non-dominant M1 stimulation was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. A subgroup of 10 FTD patients (6 with nfv-PPA and 4 with Bv-FTD) also underwent a control experiment in which 12 MEPs were recorded both at rest and during 20 maximum contraction of the FDI muscle.",

      "text": "Possible differences in age and gender between HS and FTD patients, as well as between nfv-PPA and bv-FTD patients, were evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Fisher-exact test, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare clinical and neuropsychological measures (i.e. disease duration, MMSE, FAB, CDR-FTD, VPF and VSF scores, TMT subtypes A and B) in nfv-PPA and bv-FTD patients.\nThe statistical analysis of the neurophysiological data was performed by using the unpaired Student t-test to compare RMTs, MT 1mV and the baseline MEP amplitude for each hemisphere in Experimental design: four different linguistic (reading aloud, silent reading, syllabic phonation) and non-linguistic (non-letter strings) tasks randomly presented with an inter-trial interval of at least 5 s. During the inter-trial interval, subjects were instructed to look at a fixation point (small cross) placed exactly at the centre of the computer screen. Single TMS pulses were applied to the primary motor cortex over the dominant and non-dominant hemisphere 600 ms after visual cue onset. Twelve motor evoked potentials were recorded for each condition during the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.\npatients with FTD and HS. A repeated measures ANOVA (rmA-NOVA), with task (5 levels: baseline, reading aloud, silent reading, non-letter strings, syllabic phonation) and hemisphere (2 levels: dominant and non-dominant hemisphere) as within-subject factors, was used to test differences in MEP amplitude in the HS group. To evaluate neurophysiological differences between HS and FTD patients, we normalized the MEP amplitudes to their corresponding baseline value. We then conducted a rmANOVA with the between-subject factor group (2 levels: HS and FTD) and the within-subject factors task (4 levels: reading aloud, silent reading, non-letter strings, syllabic phonation) and hemisphere. We used an unpaired t-test to determine whether changes in the MEPs observed during the reading aloud task differed in the two clinical variants of FTD (i.e. nfv-PPA and bv-FTD). The same test was used to evaluate neurophysiological differences in the reading aloud task between FTD patients with and without Parkinsonism, and in patients who were being chronically treated or were not being treated with memantine. A rmANOVA with experiment (2 levels: main experiment and control experiment) and condition (2 levels: baseline and task) as factors was used to detect any differences between MEP amplitude changes during the FDI 20 maximum contraction task and during the reading aloud task. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied when a violation of sphericity in Mauchlys tests was detected. Post-hoc comparisons were performed by means of paired t-tests when significant interactions in the rmANOVAs occurred. The level of significance was initially set at p  0.05, with Bonferronis correction subsequently being applied to multiple comparisons.\nIn order to detect possible differences in mean FA values between HS and FTD patients as well as between nfv-PPA and bv-FTD, neuroimaging data were analysed by using the tool Randomise of FSL and a general linear model (GLM). Voxel-wise non-parametric (permutation-based) two-group comparison test was applied. Another GLM tool was used to examine possible correlations between FA values and neurophysiological measures and constrained analysis within the abovementioned regions of interest. We used the threshold-free cluster enhancement method for clustering 36, both with and without correction for multiple comparisons through Family-wise Error (FWE) at p  0.05. Mean FA values from the left and right-sided SLF-t, ILF and UnF were compared using an unpaired FTD-HS group t-test. Multiple comparisons were used for this purpose (p  0.05, False Discovery Rate).\nWe used Spearmans rank-correlation to examine the possible pathophysiological link between clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures.\nUnless otherwise stated, all the values are presented as mean  SD.

By contrast, when comparing the two FTD clinical variants (bv-FTD and nfv-PPA), the FA values were comparable in all the WM tracts considered in the dominant and in the non-dominant hemisphere (Table 2).\nThe volumetric analysis showed significant lower GM density in the left frontal operculum (p ¼ 0.01) in patients than HS (Fig. 3B), whereas the left parietal operculum (p ¼ 0.24) and the left precentral gyrus (p ¼ 0.07) GM density was within normal ranges (Table 3).

      "text": "In this study, the reading aloud task increased MEPs in HS but failed to do so in FTD patients. Abnormalities in the linguistic task were comparable in patients with nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. Moreover, abnormal responses were similar in patients with and without Parkinsonism. DTI revealed lower mean FA values in FTD than in HS in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. Moreover, VBM analysis disclosed lower GM volumes in the left frontal operculum, though not in the precentral gyrus and in the parietal operculum in patients than in HS. The extent of both WM and GM changes was comparable in patients with nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. Lastly, a correlation was detected only between the extent of GM loss in the left frontal operculum and the severity of language dysfunction in FTD.\nAccuracy in the clinical diagnosis of FTD and its variants was achieved by means of the most recent standardized clinical criteria 1,23. Furthermore, brain MRI and FDG-PET supported the clinical diagnosis in our patients by revealing the fronto-temporal pattern of atrophy and hypometabolism that is typical of nfv-PPA and bv- FTD 1,23,24. As no age or gender differences were observed either between HS and patients or between the nfv-PPA and bv-FTD subgroups, and all the participants were right-handed, any effects of age, gender or manual dominance-related hemispheric asymmetry on the TMS and imaging findings can be ruled out 13. The two variants differed in terms of VPF and VSF scores, with both lower in nfv-PPA than bv-FTD, indicating prominent language impairment in nfv-PPA. All the patients included in the study were able to complete the linguistic task successfully, hence our findings cannot be ascribed to incorrect or incomplete word production related to the specific experimental design. Moreover, the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks were randomly presented and the voice intensity was kept constant during the experiments. The words used for the linguistic task were not represented by action verbs or manipulable objects, thus excluding a possible modulation of M1 excitability by the processing of language material expressing a motor content 37e39. Lastly, the similar RMTs, MT 1mV , baseline MEP amplitudes and MEP changes during the reading aloud task in patients treated or not treated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine allowed us to exclude any effect of this drug on our results.",

    "Neurophysiological abnormalities in FTD": {
      "text": "The main finding of the study is that when TMS was delivered over the dominant hemisphere, the reading aloud task did not facilitate MEPs in patients with FTD but did in HS. One possible explanation is that this abnormality merely reflects intrinsic changes in M1. This hypothesis is, however, unlikely for several reasons: first, none of the patients studied exhibited clinical or electrophysiological signs of corticospinal damage; second, patients and controls had comparable RMTs, MT 1mV and baseline MEPs, which suggests that the baseline neurophysiological measures in our FTD patients were normal; third, the volumetric analysis revealed that the GM volumes in the left precentral gyrus were comparable in both patients and HS, which points to the structural integrity of M1. Another possible explanation besides the structural damage of M1 is that the lack of MEP facilitation during the reading aloud task in FTD reflects a global and unspecific impairment in the physiological mechanisms responsible for MEP facilitation. However, we found that MEP facilitation during a simple motor task (mild muscle contraction) 40 was normal in FTD. In a previous study conducted on FTD patients, we demonstrated that Parkinsonism may lead to changes in a number of TMS parameters that probe M1 facilitation 21,22. However, the similarities in the neurophysiological abnormalities between patients with and those without Parkinsonism allowed us to exclude that this clinical syndrome affects responses to the linguistic task. Hence, we conclude that in FTD, the lack of MEP facilitation during the reading aloud task could reflect abnormal activation of expressive language areas, including M1, in the speech-related cortical network. Another novel finding that emerges from this study is that responses to TMS during the linguistic task were comparable in patients with bv-FTD and nfv-PPA. The observation that the linguistic task failed to induce MEP facilitation in patients with bv-FTD and nfv-PPA points to abnormal speech-related cortical network activation in FTD, independently from the specific clinical variant. We also found a lack of correlation between neurophysiological abnormalities and the severity of language dysfunction, as assessed by the verbal phonemic and semantic fluency tests, in FTD.",

    "Neuroimaging abnormalities in FTD": {
      "text": "DTI analysis demonstrated structural damage in languagerelated WM bundles, highlighted by the reduced FA values in the SLF-t, ILF and UnF, in both hemispheres. No correlation resulted between DTI measures, the clinical evaluation of language dysfunction severity, and M1 excitability changes in FTD. DTI also revealed that the extent of damage in all the WM bundles involved in the speech-related network was similar in bv-FTD and nfv-PPA patients. Our findings are fully in line with previous neuroimaging studies which reported severe WM damage in FTD, regardless of the specific clinical variant 4e9. Interestingly, WM abnormalities have been also described in the pre-symptomatic stage of FTD, as shown in microtubule-associated protein tau, C9ORF72 and progranulin gene mutation carriers 41e43 a finding which strongly supports the early pathophysiological involvement of WM changes in FTD.\nIn addition to the DTI findings, VBM analysis demonstrated significant GM loss localized in the left frontal operculum 44e46 but not in the left parietal operculum and precentral gyrus, in patients with FTD. Furthermore, VBM demonstrated similar abnormalities (comparable GM loss in the left frontal operculum) in bv-FTD and nfv-PPA patients. Previous studies have demonstrated prominent GM loss in paralimbic areas and insula in bv-FTD 24,47, whereas nfv-PPA is characterized by GM atrophy in the left frontoinsular cortex 24,44,45. However, our results are in line with studies directly comparing GM in bv-FTD and nfv-PPA and demonstrating similar amount of GM atrophy in frontal operculum in the two clinical variants 4,6. Our findings therefore suggest that GM atrophy in the left frontal operculum combined with widespread changes in language-related WM bundles are shared pathophysiological features in bv-FTD and nfv-PPA patients.\nOverall our neuroimaging findings may raise the hypothesis that WM changes and GM loss in the frontal operculum do not play a role in the pathophysiology of language dysfunction in patients with FTD. However, in the whole group of patients with FTD, we found that the degree of GM atrophy in the left frontal operculum correlated significantly with verbal phonemic and semantic fluency tests. Indeed, some of our bv-FTD patients showed reduced scores in the verbal phonemic and semantic fluency tests, which is consistent with the progressive language deterioration often observed in bv-FTD during the course of the disease 47e50. We therefore speculate that the degree of GM atrophy in the frontal operculum likely contributes to the pathophysiology of language dysfunction in our cohort of patients. In this study in FTD, we found no significant correlation among structural neuroimaging data and neurophysiological measures, possibly due to different factors. WM and GM changes in cortical regions other than those here examined would have possibly contributed to the neurophysiological abnormalities we observed in the present study. Also, our neurophysiological and neuroimaging measures would differ in terms of sensitivity in discriminating functional connectivity changes in frontal regions in FTD.\nOur study has certain limitations that should be considered. The sample size we tested was relatively small, in part owing to the low prevalence of this rare disease. In addition, although we applied the most recent clinical radiological criteria for the diagnosis of FTD and its variants 1,23, our study did not include a diagnostic confirmation of the specific neurodegenerative FTD pathology by means of bio-humoral markers or a post-mortem examination. Regarding the neuropsychological evaluation, we did not use specific tests to evaluate agrammatism nor behavioural tasks to differentiate patients with nfv-PPA and bv-FTD. Concerning the experimental paradigm, our linguistic task implying a non-invasive TMS approach only allowed an indirect assessment of functional connectivity among frontal regions responsible for expressive language functions. Since we focused the neuroimaging analysis on specific WM bundles and cortical areas, we cannot exclude the possibility that other WM tracts or cortical regions also contributed to the language dysfunction in our cohort of patients with FTD.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "The results of the present study provide converging neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence of abnormal speechrelated cortical network activation in patients with FTD. The functional alterations in the linguistic task, as documented by TMS point to a disconnection in the speech-related cortical network in FTD patients, regardless of the clinical variant. Our structural neuroimaging study also disclosed WM and GM alterations in brain regions included in the speech-related cortical network which are shared by the two clinical variants of FTD. Hence, differently from what we expected, the two clinical variants did not differ in terms of neurophysiological or neuroimaging measures. However, although there was no correlation between these measures, VBM analysis disclosed a significant correlation between GM loss in the frontal operculum and language impairment severity in the whole group of FTD. We suggest that the functional and structural disconnection in the speech-related cortical network we demonstrated with neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques reflects an abnormal neurobiological substrate of FTD. On the other hand, cortical atrophy in the frontal operculum plays the major role in the pathophysiology of language dysfunction in FTD. Future studies on patients with different stages of the disease and on mutation carriers may clarify whether functional and structural abnormalities occur with different timing during the course of the disease, and whether combined TMS, VBM, and DTI measures represent useful biomarkers in FTD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is a common pathological finding in the brains of older adults, especially those older than 80 years of age, and is characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) primarily in limbic structures of the brain (Nelson et al., 2019). LATE-NC commonly co-exists with Alzheimers Disease (AD) (Arai et al., 2009;Tremblay et al., 2011), hippocampal sclerosis (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007;Zarow et al., 2012), and Lewy body disease (Aoki et al., 2015;Arai et al., 2009), as well as with microvascular pathologies including arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and microinfarcts (Agrawal et al., 2021a). LATE-NC has been associated with neurodegenerative changes and an amnestic dementia syndrome mimicking AD (Nelson et al., 2019). Pathology studies have demonstrated that LATE-NC typically begins in amygdala and extends to limbic and neocortical brain regions in later stages of the disease (Josephs et al., 2016;Nelson et al., 2019). A number of neuroimaging studies combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathology data have demonstrated LATE-NC associated gray matter atrophy in the medial temporal (Bejanin et al., 2019;Dawe et al., 2011;De Flores et al., 2020;Heywood et al., 2022;Josephs et al., 2016;Makkinejad et al., 2019;Nelson et al., 2019;Teipel and Grothe, 2023;Yu et al., 2020) and frontal lobes (Bejanin et al., 2019;Josephs et al., 2016;Kotrotsou et al., 2015;Nelson et al., 2019). In agreement with these findings, recent work utilizing metabolic imaging with 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has highlighted significant LATE-NC associated hypometabolism in medial temporal and frontal lobe regions (Buciuc et al., 2020;Grothe et al., 2022). A recent MRI and pathology study showed that LATE-NC is associated with lower R 2 relaxation rate in a spatial pattern consistent with the distribution of LATE-NC in gray matter, involving regions of the temporal, frontal, occipital lobes and basal ganglia (Tazwar et al., 2022). Interestingly, the same study also demonstrated that LATE-NC is associated with lower R 2 in white matter providing temporo-temporal, fronto-temporal, and temporo-basal ganglia connectivity (Tazwar et al., 2022), indicating for the first time that the disease impacts not only the nodes (gray matter) but also the edges (white matter) of a well-connected network. Since most studies of LATE-NC have focused on gray matter, further investigation into the relation of LATE-NC with white matter integrity and connectivity is needed.\nDiffusion MRI has been used extensively to investigate white matter anomalies in various neurodegenerative disorders (Goveas et al., 2015). However in LATE, only a single diffusion MRI study without autopsy confirmation and without controlling for multiple pathologies has shown that an FDG-PET LATE signature was correlated with lower neurite density in temporal white matter (Raghavan et al., 2022). The impact of LATE-NC on individual white matter tracts connecting regions where TDP-43 inclusions are typically observed has not been explored.\nGraph theory provides a mathematical framework to represent the brain as a complex network of nodes and edges and by integrating structural and topological information of white matter, it can offer insights into the integrity of networked brain systems in health and disease (Sporns, 2018). Several studies using graph theory have demonstrated brain network alterations in neurodegenerative disorders (Lo et al., 2010;Raj et al., 2012;Raj and Powell, 2018). However, the impact of LATE-NC on the topological organization of the network typically harboring TDP-43 inclusions has not been investigated.\nIn this MRI and pathology investigation in community-based older adults we tested the hypothesis that LATE-NC is associated with abnormalities in white matter structural integrity and connectivity of a network of temporal, frontal, occipital and subcortical brain regions typically harboring TDP-43 inclusions in LATE, referred to here as the LATE-NC network (Josephs et al., 2016;Nag et al., 2018;Nelson et al., 2019). In this study we combined ex vivo MRI and detailed neuropathologic evaluation assessing LATE-NC, Alzheimers pathology, Lewy bodies, gross and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). To test our hypothesis, we first performed a connection-level analysis examining the association of LATE-NC with the structural integrity of individual white matter connections of the LATE-NC network, controlling for other neuropathologies. Next, we conducted a network-level analysis to test the association of LATE-NC with global and local graph theory measures of the integrity of the LATE-NC network, controlling for other neuropathologies. We also investigated graph theory metrics at different LATE-NC stages and identified the earliest disease stage exhibiting statistically significant network anomalies. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that LATE-NC network abnormalities are associated with faster cognitive decline.",

    "Participants and clinical evaluation": {
      "text": "Data used in this work came from autopsied participants of three longitudinal clinicalpathologic cohort studies of aging, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), the Religious Orders Study (ROS) (Bennett et al., 2018), and the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) (Barnes et al., 2012). All three studies were approved by an institutional review board of Rush University Medical Center. All participants gave written informed consent and signed an anatomical gift act form agreeing to donate their brain at the time of death. Participants were enrolled in the three studies without known dementia at baseline, and underwent annual clinical evaluations including medical history, neurological examination, and detailed cognitive function testing (Bennett et al., 2018). A battery of 19 cognitive tests was administered to assess performance in five cognitive domains: episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability. Raw scores from these tests were standardized into z-scores using baseline mean and standard deviation, and then averaged to generate a composite score of global cognitive function for each participant. The same procedure was repeated to create five cognitive domain-specific composite scores (Boyle et al., 2006). Clinical diagnosis of AD dementia was made by an experienced clinician following the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (McKhann et al., 1984). Participants who had cognitive impairment but did not meet the criteria for dementia were classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Bennett et al., 2002;Boyle et al., 2006), whereas subjects without dementia or MCI were categorized as no cognitive impairment (NCI). For the present study, we considered the first 184 participants who: (i) had completed baseline clinical evaluation, (ii) had died and had been autopsied, (iii) had ex-vivo diffusion MRI data that had been processed and passed quality checks, (iv) had complete neuropathological evaluation data that passed quality checks, and (v) did not have frontotemporal lobar degeneration (not a common pathology in community cohorts), tumors, large hemorrhages, or large infarcts.",

The cerebrum was split into two hemispheres by bisecting the corpus callosum. The hemisphere with more visible pathology was immersed in phosphate-buffered 4 formaldehyde solution and was imaged with diffusion-weighted MRI on a 3 Tesla scanner at room temperature as soon as the scanner became available and within 24 hours postmortem (the ex-vivo MRI protocol is summarized in Appendix 1). The hemisphere was then refrigerated at 4 C. At approximately 30 days postmortem the refrigerated hemisphere was allowed to return to room temperature and was imaged with MRI a second time using a multi-echo spin-echo sequence on a 3 Tesla scanner (see ex-vivo MRI protocol in Appendix 1). After the second ex-vivo MRI session, all hemispheres underwent detailed histopathologic examination by a board-certified neuropathologist blinded to all clinical and imaging findings.",

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were segmented based on bias-field-corrected multi-echo spin-echo data using in-house software combining SPM12 (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) and FSL (Zhang et al., 2001), and the total WMH volume was calculated for each participant. Gray and white matter were segmented on multi-echo spin-echo data, and gray matter was further segmented into multiple regions using a multi-atlas segmentation approach implemented in-house. Regional gray matter volumes were calculated and normalized by the total hemisphere volume for each participant. Quality checks were performed at each stage of image processing.",

    "LATE-NC network construction": {
      "text": "Brain networks consist of gray matter regions (nodes) connected by white matter tracts (edges). The nodes selected for the LATE-NC network were temporal, frontal, occipital and subcortical gray matter regions typically harboring TDP-43 inclusions according to the LATE pathology literature (Bejanin et al., 2019;Josephs et al., 2016;Nag et al., 2018;Nelson et al., 2019;Tazwar et al., 2022), and they were translated into the following 19 gray matter regions of the Desikan-Killiany parcellation scheme defined in the IIT Human Brain Atlas v.5.0 https:www.nitrc.orgprojectsiit (Qi and Arfanakis, 2021): amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal cortex, middle temporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, temporal pole, fusiform, putamen, pallidum, accumbens, lateral occipital cortex, rostral middle frontal cortex, caudal middle frontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. Maps of the connections between nodes of the LATE-NC network were obtained from the corresponding track density images (TDIs) of the IIT atlas after thresholding by 5 of the maximum number of streamlines per TDI. The maps of the connections of the LATE-NC network were then transformed to the space of each participants FA maps (Fig. 1A,B). The mean FA value across all voxels of a connection was extracted and the mean FA values for all connections were entered in a 1919 connectivity matrix for each participant (Fig. 1C), which was used in the connection-level analysis examining the association of LATE-NC with the structural integrity of individual white matter connections of the LATE-NC network (Fig. 1D). When no connection was present between two regions, a value of zero was included in the corresponding cell of the connectivity matrix of all participants. The same approach for constructing connectivity matrices for brain subnetworks was used in Jolly et al., 2020. For the network-level analysis testing the association of LATE-NC with graph theory measures of the integrity of the LATE-NC network (Fig. 1E,F) the above connectivity matrices were constructed again with the only difference that the mean FA of each connection was weighted by the number of streamlines in the connection.",

These measures were selected based on their capacity to quantify network integration (path length, global efficiency), segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, local efficiency), centrality (nodal strength, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality), and resilience to brain abnormalities (assortativity coefficient) (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010).

      "text": "Detailed neuropathologic examination was performed by a board-certified neuropathologist blinded to all imaging and clinical data following postmortem MRI. Each hemisphere was cut coronally into 1-cm thick slabs that were then macroscopically evaluated. Tissue blocks were selected, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm thickness, and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin. LATE-NC was assessed using immunohistochemistry with a phosphorylated monoclonal TAR5P-1D3 (pS409410; 1:100, Ascenion, Munich, Germany) TDP-43 antibody to detect TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons and glia in eight brain regions: amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus CA1 and subiculum, dentate gyrus, temporal pole, middle temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and middle frontal cortex (Nag et al., 2018). LATE-NC was graded into four stages: stage 0 (no TDP-43 inclusions), stage 1 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala only), stage 2 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala and entorhinal cortex or hippocampus); and stage 3 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala, entorhinal cortex or hippocampus, and neocortex) (Nag et al., 2018;Nelson et al., 2019). Neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were assessed in five regions (middle frontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and entorhinal cortices, and hippocampus) using a modified Bielschowsky silver stain. In each region, plaque and tangle counts were divided by the corresponding standard deviation, and the ratios were averaged across the five regions and across each other to generate a composite score of global AD pathology for each subject (Schneider et al., 2007). Moreover, a pathologic diagnosis of AD was determined using the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association (NIA-AA) criteria (Hyman et al., 2012). Counts of gross infarcts visible to the naked eye on fixed slabs were classified as 0 (none), 1 (one), or 2 (more than one) (Arvanitakis et al., 2011). Counts of microscopic infarcts were identified on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained sections from a minimum of nine cortical regions, and were also classified as 0 (none), 1 (one), or 2 (more than one) (Arvanitakis et al., 2011). Based on assessments in four regions (middle frontal, middle temporal, angular and calcarine cortices), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Boyle et al., 2015). Lewy bodies were examined in seven regions (middle frontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, entorhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices, amygdala, and substantia nigra) and were rated as present or absent (Agrawal et al., 2021b). Severity of atherosclerosis was determined based on the quantity and degree of vascular involvement at the circle of Willis and was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Arteriolosclerosis was identified based on the severity of vessel wall thickening with emphasis on smaller arterioles (less than 50 microns) in HE-stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia and was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Arvanitakis et al., 2016).",

    "Statistical analyses": {
      "text": "For connection-level analysis, we used linear regression to test the association of the structural integrity of individual white matter connections of the LATE-NC network (dependent variable) with LATE-NC stages (independent variable). The model was adjusted for demographics (age at death, sex, years of education), other age-related neuropathologies (i.e., the composite score of global AD pathology, the presence of Lewy bodies, the ordinal variables for gross and microscopic infarcts, the severity of CAA, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis), the total volume of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) expressed as log-transformed percentage of the total hemisphere volume, the total gray matter volume of the LATE-NC network normalized by total hemisphere volume, postmortem interval to fixation, postmortem interval to imaging, and scanner. WMH was included as a covariate because it is common in older adults and lowers FA values (Maillard et al., 2011), and the gray matter volume of the LATE-NC network was included as a covariate to control for the morphometric abnormalities observed in these regions in association with LATE-NC. This model was run separately for each white matter connection of the LATE-NC network (171 connections in total for a 1919 symmetric connectivity matrix). Given that there were no streamlines for two connections, the model described above was actually run in the remaining 169 connections. For each connection, the values of the dependent variable were extracted from the corresponding cell of the 1919 symmetric connectivity matrices of the participants. The null distribution was built with 10,000 permutations using the PALM tool in FSL (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) (Winkler et al., 2014). To account for scanner-related differences in FA values, we defined two exchangeability blocks (one per scanner) so that permutations occurred only between participants imaged on the same scanner. Statistical significance was set at p0.05 after family-wise error rate (FWER) adjustment to correct for multiple comparisons.\nFor network-level analysis, we used linear regression to test the association of global and regional graph theoretic measures (dependent variable) with LATE-NC stages (independent variable), controlling for demographics, other neuropathologies, and all the other covariates mentioned in the previous paragraph. This model was tested separately for each global and regional metric (5 global and 6 regional metrics; see Section 2.5). In addition, for those global and regional network measures that showed significant association with LATE-NC, we compared their values in LATE-NC stages 1, 2, 3 to those in LATE-NC stage 0 using linear regression and controlling for demographics, other neuropathologies and covariates as described above, with the goal to identify the earliest LATE-NC stage exhibiting statistically significant network anomalies. All network-level analyses were performed using 10,000 permutations in PALM, and statistical significance was set at p0.05 after FWER adjustment as described above. Visualization of network properties was performed using BrainNet viewer (Xia et al., 2013).\nTo investigate the association of global graph measures of the LATE-NC network with the level of cognition at the time of death and with the rate of decline in cognitive function, we used linear mixed-effects models. In each model, the longitudinal dependent variable was either the global or each of the five cognitive domain-specific composite scores, and the independent variables were one of the five global network measures and its interaction with the time before death. Models were controlled for demographics (age at death, sex, years of education), postmortem interval to fixation, postmortem interval to imaging, and scanners. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and the resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this MRI and pathology investigation in community-based older adults we tested the hypothesis that LATE-NC is associated with abnormalities in white matter structural integrity and connectivity of a network of brain regions typically harboring TDP-43 inclusions in LATE (thereby termed LATE-NC network). Analysis at the individual connection level identified 27 temporo-temporal, temporo-basal ganglia, and frontotemporal connections of the LATE-NC network that had lower structural integrity with greater LATE-NC stage, controlling for other neuropathologies, demographics and covariates. Analysis at the network level using graph theory metrics demonstrated that LATE-NC network integration and segregation was lower for greater LATE-NC stage, again controlling for other neuropathologies, demographics and covariates. This connection-level and network-level information may be used in the future in combination with other imaging, genetic, or fluid-based metrics to develop markers of this devastating neuropathology which can currently be diagnosed only at autopsy. Furthermore, the present study showed that the connection-level and network-level abnormalities in the LATE-NC network became statistically significant in stage 3. This suggests that the earliest impact of the pathology on the LATE-NC network can be detected when TDP-43 inclusions extend beyond the amygdala and have reached the cortex. Moreover, LATE-NC network abnormalities were associated with faster decline in global cognition, and specifically in episodic and semantic memory, demonstrating the importance of this network in cognitive health. While most studies of LATE-NC have focused on gray matter, the present study provides important new information into the relation of LATE-NC with white matter integrity and connectivity, and their implications on cognition.\nIn the analysis at the individual connection level, we observed lower diffusion anisotropy with greater LATE-NC stage in 27 temporo-temporal, temporo-basal ganglia, and frontotemporal connections, controlling for a comprehensive list of other neuropathologies, demographics and covariates, including WMH and gray matter volume. Lower diffusion anisotropy may generally indicate demyelination, or loss of axons and synapses, or increased water content (Beaulieu, 2009), and therefore the independent association of lower diffusion anisotropy with LATE-NC is consistent with the neurobiological processes of neurodegeneration occurring in LATE. In addition to our current findings, our previous work showed that LATE-NC is associated with lower transverse relaxation rate in white matter providing temporo-temporal, temporo-basal ganglia, and fronto-temporal connectivity, likely attributed to neurodegeneration (Tazwar et al., 2022). Furthermore, a recent diffusion MRI study without autopsy confirmation and without controlling for other pathologies showed that an FDG-PET LATE signature was correlated with lower neurite density in temporal white matter (Raghavan et al., 2022). The above suggests that the present work has identified a group of connections that have lower structural integrity in LATE-NC plausibly due to neurodegeneration linked to this pathology.\nThe connections that exhibited lower diffusion anisotropy with higher LATE-NC stage included mainly connections of temporal regions to other regions of the temporal and frontal lobes and basal ganglia. These temporal lobe regions included the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and temporal pole among others (Table 3). Interestingly, among all amygdala connections, the ones that exhibited lower diffusion anisotropy with higher LATE-NC stage are all restricted within the temporal lobe and include those to the entorhinal cortex, temporal pole, fusiform, and superior temporal cortex (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the implicated connections of the entorhinal cortex include few that are inside the temporal lobe (those to the temporal pole, fusiform, and inferior temporal cortex), but also few that exit the temporal lobe and connect the entorhinal cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex, rostral middle frontal cortex, and insula, and the implicated connections of the temporal pole include connections to multiple other temporal, frontal and basal ganglia regions (Fig. 2B). This set of connections that exhibited lower diffusion anisotropy with higher LATE-NC stage forms a pattern of connectivity that is generally consistent with the stereotypical spread of this pathology in the brain. In LATE, TDP-43 inclusions are typically found first in the amygdala, then extend to the hippocampusentorhinal cortex, and then to other cortical areas (Josephs et al., 2016;Nag et al., 2018;Nelson et al., 2019), with the temporal pole serving as an intermediate step following the entorhinal cortex and preceding most other cortical areas (Nag et al., 2018). This good match between the connections exhibiting lower structural integrity and the known progression of the pathology through the brain support the hypothesis that LATE-NC may spread along these white matter pathways, leading to axonal degradation, loss of signaling, and postsynaptic dendrite retraction (Raj et al., 2012;Seeley et al., 2009). Despite the long-standing interest in the spread of pathological protein aggregates, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. However, some studies have proposed that the spread of LATE-NC may be similar to other proteins such as tau and α-synuclein, which are known to exhibit prion-like behavior (Goedert et al., 2014;Nonaka and Hasegawa, 2020). Extensive investigation is clearly needed to test this hypothesis.\nNetwork-level analysis using graph theory metrics demonstrated global network abnormalities with greater LATE-NC severity. These included lower global efficiency and higher characteristic path length suggesting weaker integration in the LATE-NC network for more advanced stages of the disease (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Lower transitivity, average local efficiency, and assortativity were also observed suggesting lower structural integrity in connections between neighboring regions and generally lower global segregation in the LATE-NC network (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Our findings are in line with investigations of global network properties in other neurodegenerative disorders such as AD (Lo et al., 2010;Pereira et al., 2016;Tijms et al., 2013), providing further evidence on the type of abnormalities that occur in brain networks due to neurodegeneration.\nNode-centric anomalies were also observed in association with LATE-NC stage. Lower local efficiency and clustering coefficient were seen mainly in temporal and frontal lobe regions (Fig. 4), indicating worse local communication with neighboring areas. Higher nodal path length with higher LATE-NC stage was observed in most regions, suggesting less efficient communication between nodes due to lower integrity of long-range connections. Both lower and higher betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality were observed for greater LATE-NC stage. Nodes with high betweenness centrality are considered important for maintaining network communication (hub connections), and lower integrity in connections to these nodes may result in lower betweenness centrality (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Nodes with high eigenvector centrality are considered to have connections to other highly connected nodes, and if the integrity of the connections to these highly connected neighbors is lower, then the eigenvector centrality of the node is lower. Here, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality as well as nodal strength were lower in important regions of the LATE-NC network such as the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and temporal pole, indicating lower integrity in their connectivity and the connectivity of their neighbors. In contrast, basal ganglia and some frontal and temporal regions showed increased centrality values that is difficult to explain with the currently available data. Previous studies that also observed higher centrality suggested that it reflects some sort of a compensatory mechanism (Fagerholm et al., 2015). Overall, our findings imply that LATE is a disconnection syndrome, similar to what has been described in AD (Reid and Evans, 2013).\nStage-wise comparisons showed that network abnormalities were detectable only in LATE-NC stage 3. In previous work we found significant R 2 anomalies in white matter only in stages 2 and 3 (Tazwar et al., 2022). Here, we unfortunately had to combine stages 2 and 1 because only 6 of the participants had LATE-NC stage 2, and therefore it was not possible to investigate if abnormalities were detectable at stage 2. Nevertheless, we can conclude that connectivity abnormalities were not detectable at the early stages of the disease. Prior research (Nag et al., 2018) has shown that the earliest signs of cognitive impairment are detected in LATE-NC stage 2 in the form of lower episodic memory, and are more extensive in stage 3 in multiple domains including episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceptual speed. These observations indicate that the effects of LATE-NC on brain connectivity may be more profound in later stages of the disease.\nLower global integration and segregation of the LATE-NC network were associated with a faster decline in global cognition, and specifically in episodic and semantic memory. These findings are complementary to clinical pathologic studies on the associations of LATE-NC with cognitive decline (Nag et al., 2018;Wilson et al., 2019). Overall, weaker network integration and segregation may be one of the important mechanisms by which impairments in the domains of episodic and semantic memory, as well as in global cognition, are produced in LATE-NC.\nThe hypotheses of the present work focused on the LATE-NC network which is comprised of temporal, frontal, occipital and subcortical brain regions typically harboring TDP-43 inclusions in LATE. In Appendix 3, we performed exploratory analyses considering regions throughout the cerebral hemisphere and obtained very similar results. This suggests that, indeed, the LATE-NC network is the most vulnerable in LATE-NC compared to the rest of the cerebral hemisphere.\nLATE-NC commonly co-exists with Alzheimers disease, and both LATE-NC and neurofibrillary tangles have an impact on gray matter regions of the LATE-NC network. In Appendix 4, we conducted additional analyses to identify white matter connectivity anomalies in the LATE-NC network that are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and to compare them to those associated with LATE-NC. We observed lower diffusion anisotropy in 4 temporo-temporal connections with greater tangles burden. The 4 connections linked to tangles burden were among the 27 that were linked to LATE-NC stage. Although the pattern of abnormality in the integrity of white matter connections was different for the two pathologies, there was also some overlap. These findings suggest that while diffusion anisotropy in the LATE-NC network is sensitive to LATE-NC, additional information from clinical tests andor imaging modalities must be combined to develop a marker that has high specificity for this pathology.\nThe present study has major strengths and some limitations. First, the availability of detailed autopsy data from a community-based cohort of older adults, including a range of neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies which have been known to influence diffusion anisotropy values (Kantarci et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2009;Mascalchi et al., 2019;van Veluw et al., 2019), has allowed us to investigate the independent contribution of LATE-NC on white matter structural integrity. Second, the use of ex-vivo MRI as opposed to in-vivo MRI ensured that no additional pathology developed between imaging and autopsy and allowed capturing of brain characteristics at the same LATE-NC stage as histological examination of the tissue, which is especially important for investigating white matter abnormalities at different stages of the disease. Third, in contrast to in-vivo MRI which is mostly performed on less frail and less impaired individuals, ex-vivo MRI can be conducted irrespectively of frailty and impairment levels, thereby improving the generalizability of results. We expect the ex-vivo MRI findings to hold in-vivo as we have already shown that ex-vivo FA values are linearly linked to in-vivo FA values, for the same tissue preparation and imaging protocol as those used here (Evia et al., 2019). Fourth, the use of weighted connections in the network-level analysis has the advantage of capturing the strength of white matter connections and provides a more nuanced understanding of the abnormalities in brain connectivity associated with LATE-NC. One limitation of our investigation is the fact that only one hemisphere was studied per participant. Therefore, left and right hemispheres were combined in the analysis, and also interhemispheric connections were not considered in the LATE-NC network. Second, only 6 of the participants had LATE-NC stage 2 and thus it was not possible to investigate if network abnormalities were detectable in stage 2 separate from stage 1.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "The present MRI and pathology study in community-based older adults tested the hypothesis that LATE-NC is associated with abnormalities in white matter structural integrity and connectivity of a network of brain regions known to be involved in LATE. Lower structural integrity in a set of temporo-temporal, temporo-basal ganglia, and fronto-temporal connections was associated with greater LATE-NC stage independently of other neuropathologies. This set of connections formed a pattern of connectivity that is consistent with the stereotypical spread of LATE-NC in the brain. Analysis at the network level using graph theory metrics demonstrated weaker LATE-NC network integration and segregation for greater LATE-NC stage independently of other neuropathologies. This connection-level and network-level information may be used in the future in combination with other measurements to develop markers of this devastating neuropathology which can currently be diagnosed only at autopsy. Furthermore, the present study showed that the abnormalities in white matter structural integrity and connectivity in the LATE-NC network became statistically significant in stage 3, suggesting that the earliest detection of these abnormalities may be possible later in the progression of the disease. Moreover, LATE-NC network abnormalities were associated with faster decline in global cognition, and specifically in episodic and semantic memory, demonstrating the importance of this network in cognitive health. While most studies of LATE-NC have focused on gray matter, the present study provides important new information into the relation of LATE-NC with white matter integrity and connectivity, and may have important implications for future research into the diagnosis and treatment of LATE-NC in older adults.",

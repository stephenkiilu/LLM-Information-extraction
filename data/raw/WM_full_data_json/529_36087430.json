We found that the FBSS patient, like the controls, had greater GM volume relative to the bvFTD patients. Moreover, the FBSS patient had greater functional connectivity from a left inferior frontal gyrus seed than both the bvFTD patients and healthy controls groups in dorsolateral frontal areas.

      "text": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare condition affecting 5 of 100.000 people per year (Schievink, 2006). One of the main causes of SIH is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which usually occurs in the spine, causing hypoliquorrhea (Sj et al., 1998). The diagnosis of SIH is established based on typical clinical and neuroradiological findings. The most common clinical symptom is insidious onset of orthostatic headache, caused by descent of the brain and venous engorgement that occurs in the standing position. Other clinical characteristics include hypersomnolence, unsteady gait, movement disorders and tremors (Vives-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Neuroradiological features involve brain sagging, effacement of sulci, obliteration of basilar cisterns, lowering of midline structures, enlarged dural sinuses, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, and engorgement of venous structures.\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term that includes neurodegenerative disorders characterized by behavioral changes andor cognitive deficits. The behavioral variant (bv) of FTD is the most common (Ranasinghe et al., 2016), and is characterized by progressive deterioration in social function and personality; the behavioral difficulties include impulsiveness, perseveration, disinhibition, and poor social interpersonal social conduct (Rascovsky et al., 2011). BvFTD is associated with distinct imaging features including atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, insula, anterior cingulate, corpus striatum and thalamus on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as well as frontotemporal hypometabolism on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Schroeter et al., 2007).\nIn 2002, Hong and colleagues described the first case of SIH associated with a reversible bvFTD-like syndrome (Hong et al., 2002): the patient was a 66-years-old man with the typical clinical and imaging features associated with SIH such as disinhibition, personality changes, altered judgement and impaired executive functions. His Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) was normal, and his behavioral and cognitive symptoms improved with prednisone treatment, allowing to rule out a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease. After that, other cases of SIH associated with a bvFTDlike syndrome have been reported (Kent et al., 2019;Larner, 2019;Ozyigit et al., 2018;Sayao et al., 2009;Schievink et al., 2018;Walker  DeMeulemeester, 2008;Wicklund et al., 2011). In 2011, Wicklund and colleagues described eight cases of what they defined as Frontotemporal Brain Sagging Syndrome (FBSS) (Wicklund et al., 2011). These authors suggested that the behavioral syndrome may be caused by the impact of brain sagging on frontotemporal circuits; however, they did not demonstrate it experimentally. More recently, Lashkarivand and Eide reviewed the literature on FBSS (or Brain Sagging Dementia e BSD e as they named it) (Lashkarivand  Eide, 2022). In their study, the authors included 70 patients with this syndrome and described two potential pathophysiological mechanisms at the basis of cognitive and behavioural changes: the first being the stretch of frontotemporal cortical structures and circuits, and the other the venous stagnation due to the stenosis at the confluence of the vein on Galen into the straight sinus, which causes decreased frontotemporal, parietal, and cerebellum perfusion.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no studies have directly compared neuroimaging features of patients with FBSS to those of patients with bvFTD or healthy controls. In the present study we report a new case of FBSS in which, using multimodal MRI imaging including resting functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences, we tested whether the behavioral changes at the basis of FBSS are associated with altered functional and structural connectivity of the frontal lobes. More precisely, we hypothesized that our patient with FBSS would overlap with bvFTD patients, and differ from healthy controls, on measures of functional and structural connectivity, but not on measures of atrophy. She would overlap, instead, with healthy controls and differ from patients with bvFTD only on measures of focal atrophy.",

    "Case report": {
      "text": "A 58-year-old right-handed Caucasian woman was referred to our cognitive neurology clinic in Modena, Italy, because she had gradually developed behavioral changes, including impulsiveness, apathy, and emotional blunting, over the course of the previous four years. As an example, her husband reported that the patient had suddenly decided to resign from work to fully dedicate herself to her bizarre new hobby of puppet show. She had also lost a significant amount of money from online trading. She was demonstrating increased troubles in the management of domestic activities but seemed to be unconcerned or unaware of her mistakes. While she had always been meticulously clean and organized at home and work, over the past few years she had been neglecting routine chores and appeared chaotic while cooking. Furthermore, she had been increasingly detached in social situations, even when there had been friends or relatives in their house, behaving as if she did not care about them. Finally, she had become less interested in caring for herself and maintaining good hygiene.\nIn addition, over the last year the patient had complained of increased dizziness and had been generally less steady on her feet. She reported daily episodes of striking headaches that would occur when standing from sitting or when coughing. She had noticed short-lasting episodes of hand tremor at rest, as well as daytime somnolence, to the point that she suffered from sleep attacks in dangerous situations (e.g., while driving). Finally, she had also started to complain of hypogeusia and had a progressive loss of appetite, which had led to 7 kg weight loss.\nOn admission, her neurological and physical examinations were unremarkable except for the presence of Babinski sign on right plantar reflex. The patient appeared collaborative, perfectly oriented in space and time, but easily distractable. Her language was fluent and informative. An extended neuropsychological assessment was performed (Table 1), which included the following tests: Italian version of Boston Naming Test (DAgostino, 1985) and test of verbal fluency (Costa et al., 2014) to investigate language; copy of ReyeOsterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF, Caffarra et al., 2002a) to investigate constructional praxis; the Digit Span (Monaco et al., 2013), Babcock Story Recall Test (De Renzi et al., 1977), and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT, Girtler et al., 2015) for short-and long-term verbal memory; Corsi Span (Monaco et al., 2013) and delayed recall of ReyeOsterrieth Complex Figure (Caffarra et al., 2002a) for short-and long-term visuospatial memory, respectively; the Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices (Carlesimo et al., 1996), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV e Similarities (Wechsler, 2008), Stroop Test (Caffarra et al., 2002b), Trail Making Test (Giovagnoli et al., 1996), Cancellation Test (Sala et al., 1992), phonemic fluency (Costa et al., 2014), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB, Appollonio et al., 2005), and Cognitive Estimation Task (Nichelli et al., 2002) for attentional-executive functions. Moreover, the patients husband underwent an extended semi-structured interview including the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, Binetti et al., 1998), to describe his wifes neuropsychiatric symptoms. Legal copyright restrictions prevent public archiving of the neuropsychological assessments used in this study, which can be obtained from the copyright holders in the cited references. The patients performance on the tests assessing language (Boston Naming Test and verbal fluency), constructional praxis (ROCF copy), and visual shortand long-term memory (Corsi Span and ROCF delayed recall) was within normal ranges. She also scored well on all the tests for attentional-executive functions including Ravens matrices, WAIS -Similarities, Stroop, TMT, and Cancellation Tests, except for the Cognitive Estimation Task, in which she was not able to make plausible judgements about the weights of certain objects. She also failed in the Digit Span and in the Babcock Story Recall Test, in which she performed better on the delayed than on the immediate recall. This pattern of performance qualitatively suggests that her difficulties may c o r t e x 1 5 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 3 2 2 e3 3 2 be ascribed to problems in organization of the encoded material (i.e., executive functions) for retrieval rather than encodingmemory. Her successful performance on the FCSRT, in which her retrieval benefited from semantic cues, also suggests a difficulty in executive functions rather than pure memory.\nThe brain MRI showed sagging of the brain with low-lying of cerebellar tonsils within the foramen magnum (6 mm), cisternal obliteration (interpeduncular, suprasellar, perimesencephalic and sylvian bilaterally), and pachymeningeal enhancement. This neuroimaging picture was consistent with SIH (Fig. 1).\nThe spinal MRI showed thickening of the dura mater at the encephalic and high cervical level (up to C5) and no evidence of spinal CSF leak. Nevertheless, the patient underwent a first blood patch procedure in the L2eL3 epidural space, with a two-week partial and transient improvement, followed by a relapse of gait difficulties and behavioral disturbances.\nAfter a second blood patch, two further brain MRI scans were performed. They showed progressive reduction of the meningeal thickening and enhancement, whereas the sagging of the brain remained unchanged.\nIn the following months, the patients husband reported worsening of the behavioral disturbances, in particular apathy. The patient now needed to be stimulated for simple activities such as eating and caring for herself. She also had increased headaches, fatigue, and dizziness. She was treated with intravenously (i.v.) steroids followed by oral tapering, with transient improvement of her symptoms.\nA neuropsychological assessment performed at eight months from the baseline assessment confirmed the presence of an executive deficit, which now only affected her performance in the Cognitive Estimation Task (Table 1).\nOn this assessment the patient reported that her orthostatic headaches, hypogeusia, and hypersomnolence had progressively improved. However, her husband reported that the behavioural disturbances, including apathy and emotional withdrawal, had persisted and she had become more restlessness. She had continued to be impulsive in financial choices and compulsively interested in her bizarre hobbies. Her husband reported that she still needed supervision in the execution of activities such as grocery shopping and cooking.\nA treatment trial with the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine was introduced to control impulsiveness and agitation, then suspended for side effects.\nAt nine months from the baseline assessment, the patient underwent a third L2eL3 blood patch and was treated with i.v. caffeine. Subsequently, she continued to consume caffeine at home, in much larger doses than in the past.\nAt one and a half years from the baseline assessment (and after one year from the last blood patch) the patients husband reported physical improvement and better self-care overall. However, her difficulties with cognitive tasks and housekeeping had remained, and she had lost interest in her hobbies. An MRI scan showed no significant differences from the previous ones. She denied further episodes of headaches.\nFig. 2 shows a timeline representation of the case.",

Second, all native GM images were nonlinearly registered to this study-specific template and modulated to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We report a new case of FBSS in which only the nonbehavioral symptoms improved after blood patches and treatment with i.v. steroids and caffeine, possibly related to the disappearance of the meningeal thickening and enhancement and of the venous engorgement, while the behavioural disturbances persisted. We compared multimodal imaging features of the patient to a group of patients with bvFTD and to a group of cognitively healthy controls to identify which brain abnormalities would be associated with her behavioural disturbances. We found that the FBSS patient, like the controls, had greater grey matter volume relative to the bvFTD patients. Like the bvFTD, she had decreased white matter integrity relative to the controls, and this abnormality correlated with measures of apathy.\nAs expected, our patient did not present the atrophy typical of neurodegenerative diseases. The VBM analysis showed that her pattern of GM volume was similar to those of healthy controls, and significantly greater than bvFTD patients. Indeed, lack of atrophy on the MRI had been supportive of a diagnosis different from bvFTD.\nRegarding fMRI data, we had instead hypothesized that the patient with FBSS would overlap with bvFTD patients and c o r t e x 1 5 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 3 2 2 e3 3 2 a decreased functional connectivity relative to healthy controls, in line with the suggestion that it is the interruption of frontotemporal circuits caused by the sagging of the brain associated with SIH that originates behavioral disturbances similar to those of bvFTD (Sayao et al., 2009;Wicklund et al., 2011). Several imaging studies on patients with bvFTD have shown that these patients have reduced functional connectivity measured with resting fMRI in frontal regions relative to controls (Farb et al., 2013;Filippi et al., 2013). Among others resting state networks which are thought to be the basis of how the brain is organized and functions and that can be studied with resting fMRI, the salience network (SN), which involves primarily the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, have specifically been associated with bvFTD (Ng et al., 2021;Seeley et al., 2009;Zhou et al., 2010). By using a seed-based approach to analyse resting fMRI data like previous studies identifying disease-specific abnormalities of different resting state networks (Seeley et al., 2009), we specifically tested if the FBSS patient would have altered functional connectivity in a network anchored in the frontal regions of greater atrophy in the group of bvFTD relative to the group of controls. Interestingly, we found that the FBSS patient had greater functional connectivity in that network relative to both the group of bvFTD patients and the group of healthy controls. When patients are found to have greater functional connectivity relative to controls, it is frequently suggested that such an increase may represents compensation (Hillary et al., 2015). However, it has also been suggested that increased functional connectivity in patients relative to controls may represent aberrant hyperconnectivity (Farb et al., 2013;Hillary  Grafman, 2017;Zamboni et al., 2013). Therefore, it remains unclear if increased functional connectivity in neurological diseases can be considered compensatory or aberrant (Pievani et al., 2016): also in AD, for example, it is doubtful whether the demonstrated increase of frontal connectivity facilitates cognitive functions (i.e., memory) in terms of effective compensation and adaptation (Hillary et al., 2015). We did not find any significant association between functional connectivity and measures of behavioral disturbances that could help disentangle the two alternative mechanisms. In addition, our results were not corrected for multiple comparisons, therefore any interpretation should remain purely speculative. Unexpectedly, we also did not find significant differences between bvFTD patients and controls from the fMRI results, possibly due to of the small sample size, or to the fact that our bvFTD group was at a relatively early stage of the disease progression.\nWe found that WM microstructural connectivity (measured with FA) of the FBSS patient was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, whereas it did not significantly differ from bvFTD patients. More precisely, WM integrity was significantly reduced in our FBSS patient relative to controls in the posterior part of the body of the corpus callosum. Patients with bvFTD also showed lower WM integrity relative to healthy controls in a large pattern involving almost all WM tracts, including the body of the corpus callosum. These results survived to stringent correction for multiple comparisons, even if involving a single case, and are coherent with studies showing that patients with bvFTD have DTI abnormalities compared to healthy controls, especially involving the anterior and posterior corpus callosum, the uncinate, and arcuate fasciculi (Agosta et al., 2012;Borroni et al., 2007). Significantly, they go in the same direction as the differences observed in the bvFTD group, suggesting that they may have a specific role in the origin of behavioural disturbances shared by FBSS and bvFTD. This is supported by the fact that we found a significant inverse correlation between measures of WM integrity and the severity of apathy. Like patients described in literature (Schievink et al., 2018;Wicklund et al., 2011), our FBSS patients most significant behavioural disturbances were apathyinertia, loss of empathy and perseverative behavior: based on the neuroimaging results, we suggest that behavioral changes caused by SIH are mainly due to WM microstructural damage. Across the literature, apathy has been related to abnormalities in WM pathways (Powers et al., 2014), but also to fronto-striatal, dorsolateral prefrontal, cingulum, premotormotor atrophy, hypometabolism or hypoperfusion (Ducharme et al., 2018), and to dysfunction of the noradrenergic system (Passamonti et al., 2018).\nThe present case description has several limitations. Although for the first time we compared the imaging features of a FBSS patient to a group of patients with bvFTD, it remains true that we only described one patient, thus limiting statistical comparisons; additionally, it would have been optimal to also include in the comparison a group of patients with SIH and no behavioral disturbances. Future studies should address these limitations. Moreover, we choose the patients of the bvFTD group on the basis of similar behavioral disturbances to our FBSS patient, but this may have been a biased choice, as it is difficult to find exact matches to the in terms of behavioural trajectories. Lastly, our imaging analyses, although valid, are underpowered by the fact that we compared a single case with small groups of patients with bvFTD and controls. However, our results remain novel in highlighting the role of white matter microstructural integrity in the origin of behavioral symptoms such as apathy.",

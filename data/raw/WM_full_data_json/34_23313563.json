    "abstract": "Objectives: There is mounting evidence that inflammatory processes play a key role in emotional as well as cognitive dysfunctions. In this context, research employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MR spectroscopy) suggests a possible link between structuralfunctional anomalies in the brain and an increase of circulating inflammation markers. The present paper reviews this research, with particular focus on major depressive disorder (MDD), cognitive impairment in older adults, Alzheimers disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Results: In MDD, cognitive impairment and AD, inflammatory processes have been found to be associated with both structural and functional anomalies, perhaps under the influence of environmental stress. Not enough research can suggest similar considerations in schizophrenia, although studies in mice and non-human primates support the belief that inflammatory responses generated during pregnancy can affect brain development and contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia. Conclusions: The present review suggests a link between inflammatory processes and MRI detected anomalies in the brain of individuals with MDD, older adults with cognitive impairment as well as of individuals with AD and schizophrenia.",

    "AD and cognitive impairment": {
      "text": "Several studies suggest a link between cognitive dysfunctions and inflammation. For example, increased levels of CRP are thought to be implicated in memory loss in older adults (Gunstad et al., 2006;Noble et al., 2010) by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus (Lin et al., 2009;Murray and Lynch, 1998;Semmler et al., 2005;Terrando et al., 2010). This is consistent with the results of previous research on the downstream consequences of inflammatory processes in the brain (Allan and Pinteaux, 2003;Giovannini et al., 2003;Teunissen et al., 2003;Yaffe et al., 2003).\nRecent studies suggest an active role for microglia in the mediation of amyloid toxicity and following tissue damage through the release of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules (Barger and Harmon, 1997;Tan et al., 1999). For example, elevated levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), specifically in those with impairment in multiple cognitive domains (Forlenza et al., 2009). Also, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is strongly associated with AD senile plaques (Strauss et al., 1992) and there is evidence suggesting that amyloid plaque formation in AD might be mediated by interleukin-1 (IL-1)IL-6 acute phase reaction (Vandenabeele and Fiers, 1991). More specifically, in AD, expression of IL-6 is increased in the parietal cortex and decreased in the temporal cortex, occipital cortex and cerebellum compared to age matched controls. Further, in individuals with AD, expression of the IL-6 receptor has been found increased in frontal and occipital cortices and decreased in the temporal cortex and cerebellum (Hampel et al., 2005). A post mortem in vitro study that compared AD and non-demented age matched controls has also found increases in the production of pro-interleukin-1beta (pro-IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory peptide-1alpha (MIP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) after exposure to pre-aggregated β-amyloid peptide in microglia cultures from the corpus callosum and superior frontal gyrus (Lue et al., 2001). Importantly, suppression of the brain inflammatory and immune reaction to cellular death is thought to reduce the risk of developing AD andor to slow its progression (In t Veld et al., 1998;McGeer and McGeer, 1995), perhaps as a result of a direct relationship between cytokines and amyloid plaques.",

    "Schizophrenia": {
      "text": "Important findings come from positron emission tomography (PET) research. A recent study has shown a general increase in the wholebrain gray matter binding of isoquinoline (R)-N-(11)C-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-1-(2-chlorophenyl) isoquinoline-3-carboxamide ((11)C-(R)-PK11195)-a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand that binds activated microglia cells (and thus neuroinflammation)in schizophrenic patients within the first 5 years of disease onset (van Berckel et al., 2008) (see also Table 3). Similarly, in a study on 7 patients recovering from psychosis and 8 age-matched healthy volunteers, injection of (11)C-(R)-PK11195 indicated a significantly higher binding potential in the hippocampus, suggesting that focal neuroinflammation may play an important role during psychosis (Doorduin et al., 2009). These results are in line with MRI evidence showing a decrease in hippocampal size in schizophrenic patients, even in prodromal and first-episode patients, demonstrating that volumetric changes are not secondary to treatment (Pantelis et al., 2003;Wright et al., 2000).\nResults from animal studies are quite interesting. Injecting LPS in pregnant Rhesus monkeys, has shown to induce behavioral disturbances in the offspring. At 1 year of age, MRI revealed a significant 8.8 increase in global WM volume (WMV) distributed across many cortical regions compared to controls. GMV changes and cortical thickness were detected in parietal, medial temporal and frontal areas (Willette et al., 2011). In the mouse, a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study showed that prenatal exposure to inflammation elicits widespread differences in tract fractional anisotropy (FA, a widely used measure of fiber integrity; Beaulieu, 2002) throughout frontostriatal-limbic circuits compared to control saline exposure (Li et al., 2010). There is also evidence that MRI can reveal structural changes in stress-sensitive areas of the brain, perhaps a result of the higher basal cortisol levels found in schizophrenia (Lammers et al., 1995). In particular, the negative correlations between cortisol levels and hippocampal volume (Hoschl and Hajek, 2001;Mondelli et al., 2010) suggest that the stress-induced release of exogenous cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) (Wang and Dunn, 1999) might, at least in part, play a role in hippocampal volume changes (Marsland et al., 2008;Stone et al., 2009).",

      "text": "Participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which increases proinflammatory cytokine levels in a safe manner. Cytokine levels were repeatedly assessed through hourly blood draws; self-reported and observer-rated depressed mood were assessed regularly as well. Two hours after drug administration, neural activity (fMRI) was recorded as participants completed a task in which they anticipated monetary rewards.\nSubjects exposed to endotoxin, compared with placebo, showed greater increases in self-reported and observer-rated depressed mood over time, as well as significant reductions in VS activity to monetary reward cues. Moreover, the relationship between exposure to inflammatory challenge and increases in observer-rated depressed mood was mediated by between-group differences in ventral striatum (VS) activity to anticipated reward. Harrison et al. (2009)) 16 healthy male participants Participants received typhoid vaccination or saline (placebo) injection in two experimental sessions. Mood questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 2 and 3 h. Two hours after injection, participants performed an implicit emotional face perception task during fMRI sessions.\nTyphoid but not placebo injection produced an inflammatory response indexed by increased circulating IL-6 and significant mood reduction at 3 h. Inflammation-associated mood deterioration correlated with enhanced activity within subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) during emotional face processing. Furthermore, inflammation-associated mood change reduced connectivity of sACC to amygdala, medial PFC, NA, and superior temporal sulcus, which was modulated by peripheral IL-6.\nzipper (GILZ) mRNA, or SGK-1 mRNA respectively, as markers of reduced activation of the glucocorticoid system compared to those with higher serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (GILZ) mRNA expression (Frodl et al., 2012). However, these findings need replication in a larger sample size in order to confirm the relationships between inflammation, stress hormone system and brain structurefunction. Although possible antidepressant effects should be taken into account, these findings suggest that reduced glucocorticoid responsiveness and increased inflammation might have a role in the neuroplasticityneurotoxicity cascade in MDD. This study might also indicate that patients with MDD could benefit from therapeutic interventions (e.g., β-adrenergic receptor antagonism) targeting stress-related neuronal changes in the hippocampus (Wohleb et al., 2011).\nThere is also fMRI evidence that an increase in TNF-α is associated with more activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula in subjects experiencing social rejection (Slavich et al., 2010). During transient increases in plasma levels of TNF-α, positive mood has been found to be decreased and state anxiety increased. In the same study, higher TNF-α plasma concentrations correlated with increased activation of the right inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to emotional visual stimuli (Kullmann et al., 2012). In a recent fMRI study, it has been shown that inflammation alters reward-related neural activity in humans and that rewardrelated neural responses mediate the effects of inflammation on depressed mood (Eisenberger et al., 2010). Higher levels of circulating cytokines in subjects with anhedonia is associated with reduced ventral striatum responses to reward cues (Eisenberger et al., 2010), suggesting a possible relationship between anhedonia, inflammation and basal ganglia (BG) activity. Another study indicates that inflammationassociated mood deterioration correlates with increased activity within the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) during performance in an emotional face processing task. In the same study, inflammationassociated mood change was associated with reduced connectivity of sACC to amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and superior temporal sulcus, which was modulated by peripheral IL-6 (Harrison et al., 2009).\nThus, to date, we are aware of only one MRI study showing an association between peripheral inflammatory markers and brain structure supporting the hypothesis that inflammation plays a role in neurotoxicity. While there are 4 fMRI studies supporting this association between inflammatory state and brain function, more research is needed to explore and confirm whether inflammation markers are objectively and consistently indicative of brain functionalstructural anomalies in MDD individuals. These findings, in particular, might be in line with previous MRI data showing that key areas such as the hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate cortex (CC), BG, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) may go through significant functional and structural changes in affective disorders (Koolschijn et al., 2009;Macqueen and Frodl, 2011;McKinnon et al., 2009).",

      "text": "Despite the evidence that increased markers of peripheral inflammation predict cognitive decline, only a few MRI studies (Table 2) have attempted to investigate the relationship between inflammation and structuralfunctional changes in the brain in cognitively challenged individuals.\nA recent study on 1316 healthy elderly adults confirmed that IL-6, and, to a lesser degree, the concentration of CRP were associated with WM and gray matter (GM) brain changes in the hippocampus (Satizabal et al., 2012). In another sample of elderly healthy subjects, brain atrophy, assessed on a semi-quantitative scale, was associated with a combination of chemokines and cytokines-including the soluble interleukin-4 receptor (sIL-4R), IL-6 and IL-8-whereas individual cytokines or chemokines were not associated with brain atrophy or WM brain lesions (Baune et al., 2009a(Baune et al., , 2009b)).\nRecent MRI research has shown a link between peripheral markers of brain inflammation and volumetricfunctional anomalies in the brain of elderly individuals. For example, a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study on 109 community-dwelling healthy elderly subjects has revealed a significant negative correlation between regional GM volume (GMV) of the posterior and lateral aspects of the left temporal cortex and high-sensitivity CRP levels, after adjusting for age, gender, and intracranial volume (Taki et al., 2012). In another study (Raz et al., 2012), larger WMH volume was associated with advanced age, hypertension, as well as elevated levels of homocysteine and CRP. Additionally, homozygosis for the IL-1β C-511T allele and presence of the CRP-286T allele contributed to WMH. Altogether, these findings suggest that in healthy adults, who are free of neurological and vascular disease, genetic variants that promote inflammation and elevated levels of vascular risk biomarkers can contribute to brain abnormalities as detected by MRI. In elderly individuals, increase in CRP has also been found to be linked to cognitive impairment, smaller left medial temporal lobe volumes (Bettcher et al., 2012) as well as cerebral microstructural disintegration that predominantly affects frontal pathways and corresponding executive functions (Wersching et al., 2010).\nStudies measuring cortical thickness, deformation-based, VBM, structural and effective connectivity investigations, tractography studies and also fMRI research suggest that mediotemporal, neocortical, and subcortical areas of the brain could be implicated (Hampel et al., 2008). In this context, MRI research suggests that inflammation plays a role in brain volume reductions in normal aging, inflammatory biomarkers are associated with neuroimaging markers of ischemia (i.e., WMHs) and AD (i.e., total brain volume), and that suppression of the inflammatory response moderates volume reduction (Jefferson et al., 2007;Walther et al., 2011).",

      "text": "MRI evidence indicates decreased gray matter volumes in the parahippocampal gyrus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the posterior association cortex and the subcortical nuclei including the cholinergic basal forebrain (Hampel et al., 2010). MRI atrophy measurements have been associated with the histopathological lesions observed during the progression of the disease, with the hippocampal region (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) being significantly atrophic already in individuals with MCI, while changes in the temporal lobe (fusiform gyrus, lateral temporal lobe) as well as cingulate cortex progressively appear in AD (Chetelat and Baron, 2003). Importantly, structural changes in the hippocampus have been found to predict progression from MCI to AD (Jack et al., 2005). However, structural MRI is not sufficiently predictive of conversion from MCI to AD (Cuingnet et al., 2011;Ray et al., 2007). In this regard, the combined use of MRI techniques, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker assays and neuropsychological tests has been shown to improve predictive conversion accuracy (Davatzikos et al., 2011;Ewers et al., 2012) (see also Table 2).\nIncreasing attention is being paid to MRI detected structural brain changes associated with inflammation biomarkers measured in the CSF and plasma. A study on 42 AD subjects found a correlation between the CSFserum IgG index and the indices of AD severity, including clinical dementia and medial temporal lobe atrophy (Matsumoto et al., 2008). In another study, the combination of automated MRI regional volume analysis of 34 areas (including the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, amygdala and basal ganglia) with the analysis of plasma cytokines and chemokines provided the best predictor of conversion from cognitive impairment to AD (Furney et al., 2011). In the rat, MRI revealed that chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-a non-infectious agent known to evoke inflammatory responses-into the fourth ventricle enlarged the lateral ventricles and strongly activated microglia cells distributed throughout the temporal lobe regions, mainly the hippocampus (CA3CA4 and dentate gyrus) and the enthorinal cortex (Hauss-Wegrzyniak et al., 2000).\nTable 2 Representative MRI studies investigating putative association between inflammation and structuralfunctional changes in the brain in older adults and Alzheimers Disease.",

Recently, micro-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIOs,  1 μm) targeting activated platelets or endothelial adhesion molecules have been successfully used to reveal cerebrovascular inflammation following cytokine-induced CNS injury by MRI (McAteer et al., 2007;von Zur Muhlen et al., 2008). In transgenic mice with AD-like amyloidal deposits, molecular imaging using MPIOs demonstrated a role of the endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, a protein whose gene is activated after endothelial cells are stimulated by cytokines) in AD and cerebrovascular inflammation (Tan et al., 2007;Zuliani et al., 2008), suggesting a possible use of this imaging technique in the evaluation of the efficacy of treatments aiming at slowing down amyloid deposition in the brain.\nSimilarly, neuroimaging with iron-sensitive MR sequences carried out on postmortem brain tissue have been used to identify microbleeds that have been found to correlate with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive deficits (Atlas et al., 1988). A study on autopsied brains from 8 AD patients showed intense cellular apoptosis in the perifocal region of recent bleeds, along with heme oxygenase-1 activity and late complement activation. Blood and hemosiderin were noted to migrate through enlarged Virchow-Robinspaces (VRSs, perivascular compartments surrounding small blood vessels as they penetrate the brain parenchyma), propagating an inflammatory reaction along the adjacent microvasculature (Schrag et al., 2010. Other research in healthy adults has shown a link between increased leukocyte count in the VRSs and contrast-enhancing lesions, suggesting a role of the VRS in inflammatory processes of the brain (Wuerfel et al., 2008).\nOther findings suggest that MRI holds promise in the early detection of inflammation in the CNS, capable of revealing structuralfunctional anomalies in the absence of visible lesions and symptoms. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI has revealed hypoperfusion-triggered CNS injury in vascular dementia, unmasked amyloid-induced cerebrovascular activation in AD and allowed monitoring of disease activity during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Montagne et al., 2012).

In particular, Dynamic 60-min PET scans were acquired after the injection of (11)C-(R)-PK11195.\nA significantly higher binding potential of (11) C-(R)-PK11195, indicative of neuroinflammation, was found in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients than in healthy volunteers.

Additionally, tryptophankynurenine metabolism anomalies might be involved in inflammatory processes implicated in cognitive impairment, MDD (Oxenkrug, 2007) and schizophrenia (Muller et al., 2012). In this context, MRI research, over the last decade, has investigated the effects of inflammatory reactions in the brain, under the general hypothesis that structural and functional changes occur in the brain before and during the manifestation of behavioral disturbances, although, whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of these changes is still to be established. However, in this research, with the exception of a number of recent PET studies on activated microglia, only qualitative measures were provided. With this in mind, we reviewed the literature showing evidence that peripheral inflammation markers are associated with brain functionalstructural anomalies.\nThese studies confirm that inflammation has significant effects on the brain structure and function, with specific as well discreet areas showing higher vulnerability. In particular, structural changes associated with inflammation have been described in the temporal lobe, CC and PFC of individuals with MDD, cognitive impairment, AD and schizophrenia (Bettcher et al., 2012;Frodl et al., 2012;Hauss-Wegrzyniak et al., 2000;Raz et al., 2012;Satizabal et al., 2012;Slavich et al., 2010;Taki et al., 2012;Willette et al., 2011). In schizophrenia, strong effects of inflammation have also been detected in fronto-striatal-limbic circuits (Doorduin et al., 2009;Li et al., 2010;Pantelis et al., 2003;Willette et al., 2011;Wright et al., 2000). MDD research on this topic has rarely been conducted. However it suggests an association between peripheral inflammation and MRI detected anomalies in the brain.\nA key role has been given to environmental stress. For example, social stress related neural activity mediates the relationship between IL-6 increases and depressed mood (Eisenberger et al., 2009). This could be in line with the data showing that chronic social stress induces glucocorticoid-mediated pyramidal dendrite retraction in the hippocampus and changes in dendrite arborization in the PFC (Kole et al., 2004;Magarinos et al., 1996;Wellman, 2001;Woolley et al., 1990a) as well as with recent resting state fMRI data showing local connectivity anomalies in the left amygdala dACC and left ventrolateral PFC among individuals susceptible to the depressogenic effects of early life stress (Cisler et al., 2012). While there is common agreement that aging and neurodegeneration are linked to decreased adaptiveness to stress and to glucocorticoid imbalances (Sapolsky et al., 1986), there is still a need for MRI studies indicating a relationship between stress and neuroinflammation in cognitive impairment and AD. On the other hand, in schizophrenia, higher basal cortisol levels (Lammers et al., 1995) have been found to be associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (Hoschl and Hajek, 2001;Mondelli et al., 2010) and a role of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α has been suggested (Marsland et al., 2008;Stone et al., 2009;Wang and Dunn, 1999).\nInteresting findings also stem from fMRI research. Worth mentioning, is the research suggesting that the ACC and AI might mediate the effects of increased concentrations of TNF-α on mood and anxiety levels (Kullmann et al., 2012), as well as a possible role of inflammation on motivation in depressed individuals (Eisenberger et al., 2009). Additionally in MDD, TNF-α and IL-6 could be implicated in activation anomalies found in the orbital, temporal, frontal and prefrontal cortical areas as well as in the ACC and BG, during exposure to visual stimuli (Koolschijn et al., 2009;Kullmann et al., 2012;Macqueen and Frodl, 2011;McKinnon et al., 2009).\nIn aged and AD individuals, MRI has confirmed a link between inflammation and WMH (McAteer et al., 2007). Additionally, it has revealed that cerebrovascular inflammation is linked to cytokineinduced CNS injury (McAteer et al., 2007;van Berckel et al., 2008van Berckel et al., , 2008) ) as well as amyloid plaque formation. (Tan et al., 2007;Zuliani et al., 2008). However, while there is evidence that the combination of neuroimaging and neuroinflammatory marker analysis can provide important information on disease progression in AD (Furney et al., 2011), no MRI study has yet shown similar results in MDD or schizophrenia.",

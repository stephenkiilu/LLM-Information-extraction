    "abstract": "Introduction We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study white matter integrity in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods The subjects comprised 20 patients (9 men, 11 women) with FTD and 17 age-matched healthy controls (9 men, 8 women). Based on the data obtained from DTI, we performed tractography of the major cerebral pathways, including the pyramidal tracts, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) and uncinate fasciculi (UF). We measured the values of fractional anisotropy (FA) in each fiber and statistically compared the findings in patients with those in controls. Results We found a significant decrease in FA values in the selected association fibers as well as anterior fibers of the CC in the patients with FTD. The greatest decrease in mean FA of the UF was seen in advanced FTD. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in FA in the bilateral pyramidal tracts. Conclusion The features of FTD from the view point of cerebral white matter damage were revealed by tractography based on DTI. DTI is therefore considered to be a useful method, and may provide clues to elucidating the pathogenesis of FTD. Keywords Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) .

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the third most common clinical category of cortical dementia, following Alzheimers disease (AD) and Lewy body disease. The diagnostic criteria for FTD were initially proposed by the Lund and Manchester Groups 1. The concept of FTD was later expanded and roughly classified into two major subtypes: frontal variant FTD (fvFTD) and temporal variant FTD (tvFTD). The former is clinically characterized by progressive change in personality and abnormal behavior, and the latter by the presence of progressive aphasia or deficits in semantic knowledge 2.\nThe most characteristic macroscopic brain feature of FTD is localized atrophy involving the frontal andor temporal lobes. Microscopically, FTD is characterized by substantial gliosis in the white matter as well as neuronal loss 345. A recent study that attempted to quantify the histological changes in FTD revealed significantly more astrocytes and microglia in the frontal cortices compared with controls 6. Conventional MRI studies have revealed abnormal signal intensities in the frontal white matter lesions of patients with FTD as well as lobar atrophy 7. However, it is difficult to assess the degree of cerebral white matter (CWM) damage in this disease in vivo directly and quantitatively using these conventional imaging techniques. Catani et al. used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) to study in vivo the integrity of axonal fibers connecting perisylvian language areas in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and AD, and found a marked difference in the distribution of N-acetylaspartate to creatine between PPA and AD 8.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recently developed imaging technique that provides information about tissue microstructure and its physiological state 9,10. Through measurements of anisotropy of the water molecular diffusion in brain tissue, DTI can now assess changes in white matter integrity, and has been applied to the study of other neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 11,12, Parkinsons disease 13, AD 14,15 and multiple system atrophy 16.\nStudies of CWM lesions in FTD using other DTI techniques have also been reported 2,17. One such technique is the region of interest (ROI) approach 17. This is a basic and useful method, although it has certain limitations in that identification of anatomical locations and reproducibility of measured values cannot be guaranteed without standardization. Another method is voxel-based analysis (VBA). Using this method, Borroni et al. recently reported a significant CWM reduction in FTD and showed characteristic differences between fvFTD and tvFTD 2. Although this is an automated, unbiased and operatorindependent approach, it is difficult to use for accurate analysis in some regions (e.g. around the ventricles) near areas that show extremely high or low anisotropy. If the resolution is low, misregistration will occur 18.\nData analysis based on MR tractography has recently become possible 19. Tract-specific measurement (TSM) allows better anatomical localization of single tracts on MRI as compared to the ROI or VBA methods 18. Its major advantage is that it allows easy identification of specific CWM fibers and the acquisition of more specific information about them. Therefore, we adopted TSM in this study as the best method.\nThe nerve fibers in the CWM are classified into three subtypes: projection fibers, commissural fibers and association fibers. The association fibers constructing neuronal pathways within the hemisphere (intrahemisphere) are believed to be related to higher brain functions. For example, the arcuate fasciculus (AF) connecting Brocas area with Wernickes area plays an important role in verbal function 20. The uncinate fasciculus (UF) connecting the frontal lobe (orbital gyri and middle frontal gyri) with the anterior temporal lobe medial site is associated with memory function 21. The inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) connecting the occipital lobe with the anterior part of the temporal lobe is involved in visual memory and emotional processing 22.\nWe hypothesize that the degenerative process in FTD may affect frontal connections more than other connections, and the symptom profile may correlate with damage along specific pathways. However, no studies have focused on these pathways in FTD. In this study, we used DTI to quantitatively assess CWM changes in association fibers in patients with FTD and attempted to demonstrate specific neuronal pathways that might play a major role in the disease.",

      "text": "Between January 2001 and December 2006, a total of 20 patients (9 men, 11 women; average age 70.87.15 years) who had been diagnosed as having FTD were enrolled for this study. The clinical diagnosis was made by more than one neurologist based on the international consensus criteria for FTD 1,23. Based on the clinical features, they were divided into the two major clinical subtypes, fvFTD and tvFTD. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, routine laboratory examination, 123 I-IMP singlephoton emission tomography (SPECT), and conventional brain MRI study. Atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes was detected by conventional MRI in all patients. We evaluated neuropsychological functions by screening with the Minimental State Examination (MMSE). All patients were then also evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale 24 and divided into an advanced group (CDR score 2 or 3) and an early group (CDR score 0.5 or 1). Most of the patients in the advanced group had a MMSE score of less than 20 points. The patients clinical data and classification are summarized in Table 1.\nAn age-matched control group comprising 17 patients (9 men, 8 women; average age 68.210.85 years) was also included. All of them were outpatients referred to our hospital with nonspecific complaints such as headache and dizziness. All of these patients were later diagnosed as having no significant neurological disorders. Any suspected of having mild cognitive impairment were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.",

      "text": "DTI was performed on a 1.5-T whole-body scanner (Gyroscan Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique (TR 6,000 ms, TE 88 ms) with a motion-probing gradient in 15 orientations. A b value of 1000 smm 2 was used, and 12853 data points were recorded using a parallel imaging technique. The resolution of the acquired images was equivalent to 128106 pixels. Image analysis DWI data were transferred to an off-line computer for further analysis. Tractography was carried out using PRIDE software (Philips Medical Systems) written in Interactive Data Language (RSI, Boulder, CO), and was applied for TSM in the image analysis. With this identification of the anatomical location of neuronal fibers is easier than with VBA 18. For preparative tractography, we set at least two representative ROIs on the ipsilateral side (for example, in order to carry out tractography of the pyramidal tract, we identified the anatomical locations of the cerebral peduncle and posterior limb of the internal capsule by diffusionweighted MRI following the colored map of the CWM). When we detected a tract between two specific ROIs, we adopted the AND operation as described by Wakana et al. to impose a strong constraint in tracking results 25. Consequently, we were able to obtain and draw threedimensional images of the CWM based on the selected ROIs. Using a similar method, other fibers (CC, AF, UF and ILF) were also obtained. We tried to analyze the superior and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi, but they were excluded from this study because it was difficult to identify them unequivocally in some patients and the data obtained were not useful even in those in whom they were identified.\nAfter anatomical identification of each fiber by tractography, we measured the data for mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values by automatic calculation. The FA is an index that indicates the degree of diffusion anisotropy and varies from 0 (diffusion equal in all directions) to 1 (diffusion entirely unidirectional) 26.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "The tractography for each fiber in all of the patients with FTD and controls is shown in Fig. 1. The correlation coefficients for the FA values between two measurements (first measurement and second measurement by the same examiner) were more than 0.85 for all the subjects with FTD and the controls. This suggests that the FA measurements by the same examiner were reasonably reproducible.\nThe mean FA values for each measured part of patients with FTD and controls are shown in Fig. 2. The first result of interest is that the mean FA values for association fibers, including the AF, UF, and ILF, were significantly lower in the FTD patients than in the controls (P0.01). Secondly, the CC fibers were analyzed to detect any changes in commissural fibers in FTD. While the mean FA value in the genu (P0.01) was markedly lower than in the controls, the value for the splenium was decreased only slightly (P 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the mean FA values in the bilateral pyramidal tracts between the FTD patients and the controls.\nAlthough some patients with tvFTD showed asymmetry of association fibers, no significant difference was observed between right and left in each fasciculus in the FTD patients (P0.05).\nThere were no significant differences in the mean FA values between the FTD subgroups, i.e. the advanced group and the early group, except for the values in the left UF (advanced group 0.3170.0611, early group 0.3670.0328; P0.05). In addition, the neuropsychological function scores (MMSE and CDR) in the patients with FTD were significantly correlated with the FA values only for the left UF (P0.05). Spearmans correlation coefficient (r) for the correlation between the MMSE score and FA values in the left UF was 0.499, and between the CDR score and the FA values was 0.467. a Rt.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The neuronal fibers of the brain function as a barrier to water molecule diffusion. This barrier is the reason for the highly anisotropic diffusion observed in the white matter in comparison with the gray matter. Because water molecule diffusion is limited, the measured FA shows a relatively high value in areas with well organized and tightly packed neuronal fiber bundles, such as the cerebral peduncles, the internal capsule, and the corpus callosum 27. If white matter structures (axons and myelin) are damaged, the diffusivity of water molecules increases, leading to less significant directionality and a decrease in the FA value. The process of white matter damage in neurodegenerative diseases is so slow that it is difficult to assess by conventional MR imaging studies, especially in the early stages. Direct measurement of white matter integrity and quantitative evaluations of its damage have become possible using the DTI technique. The use of this technique is supported by several previous studies that have evaluated various neurological diseases 111213141516.\nWe found that all the values of the mean FA for the selected association fibers in FTD patients were significantly decreased. Because these fibers connect the temporal lobe with other cortices, they are believed to play an important role in verbal, cognitive and emotional functions. Thus, damage to these vital tracts may result in aphasia, memory disturbance or personality disorders, which are symptoms frequently observed in FTD. The decrease in FA in the left UF was significantly correlated with CDR and MMSE score, possibly indicating that the FA value for this particular tract may reflect the patients clinical stage. A previous experimental study has shown that disruption of the UF results in severe memory impairment 28. The cortices of these areas are those that are mainly affected and damaged in FTD. Thus, the FA value in this area may be the only one that enables monitoring of the severity of FTD.\nIn contrast to the UF, the degree of the decrease in FA in the AF and ILF appeared not to be significantly correlated with the clinical stage of FTD, although the FA value in the left ILF showed a decrease in most FTD patients with aphasia. It has recently been hypothesized that the temporal pole and anterior fusiform gyrus could be a part of a semantic network that might be underlain by the ILF 29. Using the method of DTI, allowing in vivo dissection of white matter fibers 30, recent studies have confirmed the classical anatomical description (direct pathway) and also defined U-shaped fibers of the occipitotemporal projection system (indirect pathway) 22. Mandonnet et al. recently reported that semantic paraphasia could be induced by the direct electrical stimulation on the ILF in patients with glioma 31. Our results indicate that the FA values in the ILF and AF may be decreased in FTD from an early stage. In the study by Borroni et al. patients with tvFTD showed white matter reductions in the ILF 2. This result is in accordance with ours. Thus the decreased anisotropy of the ILF and UF may reflect one of the pathophysiological features of FTD.\nAtrophy of the CC has been also discussed in relation to cognitive impairment 32, and a conventional MR study has shown that predominant atrophy of the genu is a characteristic of patients with FTD 33. In our study, the decrease in the FA value in the genu of the CC was greater than in the splenium, supporting the previously reported data. On the other hand, FA values in the pyramidal tracts of FTD patients were relatively high. This indicates that projection fibers are preserved in FTD even in the advanced stage. These findings suggest that the distribution of CWM damage in FTD is not uniform, and thus association fibers that are related to the frontotemporal as well as temporooccipital lobes, and anterior commissural fibers, are more selectively damaged in FTD than projection fibers.\nIf the characteristic features of FTD can be elucidated by DTI, this method may become helpful for the differential diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dementia, especially AD. Although the difference between AD and FTD has already been discussed from the viewpoints of clinical symptoms and conventional radiological findings 34,35, FA measurement by DTI may provides a new approach for understanding both diseases. Taoka et al. evaluated the tract of interest by diffusion tensor tractography and TSM in patients with AD and found that the FA values in the bilateral UF and left inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus were decreased 36. In our study, the mean FA values in the bilateral UF of FTD patients was also significantly lower than in the controls. In addition, we detected a decrease in the mean FA values in the AF and ILF in FTD patients. These fasciculi have never been assessed in any study of AD. If more striking differences in CWM changes between FTD and AD can be demonstrated by DTI at an early clinical stage, DTI may be helpful in differential diagnosis.\nHowever, there were some limitations to this study. Since we investigated a limited number of patients, a definite conclusion about the clinical applicability of DTI cannot be reached at present. In order to establish the connection between DTI findings and clinical disease, it will be necessary to demonstrate a clinicoradiological correlation in a larger number of patients. Secondly, neuropathological comparison of CWM damage was not possible because we were unable to obtain any autopsy cases. Larsson et al. were able to perform an autopsy on a patient with FTD and found moderate frontal white matter gliosis with demyelination, suggesting a correlation between the DTI data for the formalin-fixed brain and the histopathology 37. It will be necessary to verify this point in a larger number of patients with FTD in order to support the utility of DTI.\nIn conclusion, by tractography-based analysis, we were able to demonstrate quantitatively the features of FTD that affected association fibers and anterior fibers of CC in the CWM of FTD patients, which showed a decrease in FA in comparison with the control group. These findings suggest that FTD is associated with pathological changes not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the CWM. Therefore, DTI may be a useful tool for detecting this aspect of FTD, and may provide important clues for elucidating the underlying pathogenesis of the disease.",

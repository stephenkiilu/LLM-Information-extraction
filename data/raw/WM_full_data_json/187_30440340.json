    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently been added to the large scale of studies for Alzheimers Disease (AD) to investigate the White Matter (WM) defects that are not detectable using structural MRI. In this paper, we extracted Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features, based on the visual diffusion patterns of Fractional Anisotropy (FA), and Mean Diffusivity (MD) maps, to build bag-of-words AD-signature for the hippocampal area. The experiments were accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset formed of AD patients (n35), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) (n6), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) (n24) and cognitively healthy elderly Normal Controls (NC) (n31). The preliminary studied experiments give promising results that would consider the proposed system as an accurate and useful tool to capture the AD leanness with accuracy of 87 and 89 for FA and MD maps respectively.",

    "I. INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "With the senility of population in many countries, 80 of people will be affected by dementia. Alzheimers disease (AD) is a leading neurological disorder in which the death of brain cells rises problems with memory, thinking and behavior 1. Early diagnosis may have a rule in reducing the dissemination and the effectiveness of Alzheimers disease. Brain structural changes in AD subjects have been well studied, where most investigations, based on structural MRI, have focused on measuring atrophy of the Regions of Interest (ROI)s known to be affected by AD such as the hippocampus. However, structural MRI is employed in detecting macro-structural loss for AD diagnosis, whereas the micro-structural changes are remained invisible in the anatomical scan and still remains less developed 2. The later can be delineated by other MRI modalities such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).\nDTI is an MR imaging technique based on the motion of water molecules in brain-tissues, which tends to diffuse more rapidly in the direction of the internal structure and more slowly in the perpendicular to the passage of least resistance. Though, the water diffusion is the principle of interpreted as an MR signal loss. 3.\nAnatomically, the neurodegeneration is accompanied by a loss of barriers that restrict the motion of water molecules. Though, the diffusivity of water molecules are affected by random thermal fluctuations. This behavior is further modulated by the interactions with cellular membranes, Ghaidaa W.

The Hippocampus is chosen in our study, since it is responsible of forming memories as well as spatial navigation. It is also one of the earliest regions to be affected by AD 5. The Atrophy of the hippocampus and the change in its shape and size is characterizing the degree of memory impairment, which is one of the common AD diseases symptoms. Moreover, it has a high correlation with the presence of tau protein that accumulated due to the AD disease progress 6 7.\nRecently, several Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods have been proposed to support clinical individual decision making via visual and quantitative analysis of brain structures. Machine learning based systems has been used to differentiate between AD, MCI and NC subjects 8. As it is known that MCI is active area of search, its early diagnosis is very important as it gave an indication for progress of the Alzheimer. Dyrba et al. 9 employed the SVM based classification of anisotropy maps, achieving an accuracy of 80 and 83  for classifications based on FA and MD respectively. The same team applying Plants approach and an information gain criterion represented in 10. Ben et al. 8 employed the visual pattern diffusion information based on MD maps for binary classification, to reach an accuracy of 86.73 (AD vs NC), 77 (MCI vs NC) and 73.1 (AD vs MCI). The same group employed a multimodal approach, providing an accuracy of 90.2, 79.42 and 76.63 for respectively AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and AD vs. MCI binary classification problems 11.\nLiteratures suggests, nevertheless that no single biomarker provides sufficient information to capture the inert symmetry of disease contrary the realized spectrum. Several efforts are herewith underway to properly and quantitatively combine multiple biomarkers to delineate the clinicpathophysiological severity of AD. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework to build meaningful medical signature associated with the visual appearance of MD and FA maps (i.e visual appearance is related to the voxel intensity value in the image), calculated for the hippocampus, for AD patient discrimination based on binary and multiclass systems using SIFT and SURF descriptors to build AD-signature using Bagof-words a (BOW) approach. The dataset used, in this study, is a subset of Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 12. The rest of paper is organized as follows: the materials and methods are discuss in Section 2. The experiments and results are reported in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes the work and outlines its perspectives.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) initiative was to define the biomarkers that would best measure the effects of treating Alzheimers disease in clinical trials 13. This goal has been then expanded to using biomarkers to identify Alzheimers at a pre-dementia stage. The ADNI recently added DTI datasets, among several other new imaging modalities, in an effort to identify the sensitive new biomarkers of Alzheimers disease. In this study. Each ADNI subject is formed of 5 T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b0 images) and 41 diffusionweighted images (b1000 smm 2 ), acquired for each DTI slice on 3-Tesla GE Medical Systems scanners with the following imaging parameters 25625659 voxels per volume, 1.3  1.3  2.7 mm 3 voxel size; TETR61.89050ms. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a psychological test quantifying the cognitive function but isnt enough to make a full and accurate Alzheimer diagnosis because the majority of questions test only memory and recall.

      "text": "FSL was used to employ the preprocessing of DTI, for each subject 14. The preprocessing step includes the correction for eddy currents, the head motion compensation, the skull stripping with the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) and diffusion tensors estimation using DTI fit module. Where w is the weight vector and b is the bias for the input vector x. SVM maximizes the margin between support vectors by minimizing w.\nWe used a Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to train the SVM, which can be expressed as:\nIII. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS.\nOur objective is to learn a multiclass system that can discriminate between normality and abnormality of the subjects, as well as binary classification that can discriminate AD from NC, AD from MCI and MCI from NC. Our algorithms performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity calculated based on 10-fold cross validation, where 90 of the dataset were selected for training and 10 for testing for each fold. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were also used to study the robustness of the performance. The results summary are shown in Tables II andIII.\nBased on MD maps, the performance, of discriminating the AD from MCI subjects, reached 94 and 41 for sensitivity and specificity respectively, based on SURF visual words. Whereas in case of SIFT visual words, the performance has been boosted to reach 98, 91 for the sensitivity and specificity respectively. For AD versus NC classification, the system provided 100 and 55 for the sensitivity and the specificity respectively based on SURF visual words. Whereas the performance reached 97 and 100 for the sensitivity and specificity respectively in case of SIFT visual words based system. Finally, In case of MCI vs NC classification, the performance achieved 82.3, 92 sensitivity and specificity using SURF visual words and 89, 97 for the sensitivity and specificity respectively based on SIFT visual words.\nBased on FA maps, the performance of discriminating the AD from MCI had 100, 20 sensitivity and specificity respectively based on SURF while in case of SIFT, the system had 98 and 87 for sensitivity and specificity respectively. In case of AD vs MCI, the performance has been boosted to reach 92, 20 sensitivity and specificity based on SURF. Whereas in case of SIFT, the system had 98, 95 for sensitivity and specificity respectively. Finally, for MCI vs NC, the system had in case SURF visual words 49, 77 sensitivity and specificity. Whereas in case of SIFT it is reached 95, 87 sensitivity and specificity respectively.",

      "text": "(2) Compared to the literature, listed in table IV, our proposed algorithm obtained higher accuracies, although we used conventional SIFT features as visual words detection entry for BOW. Moreover, it is proved that the visual appearance of FA maps with conventional SIFT as visual words detection to BOW is promising, given that is not computationally expensive compared to MD, and can distinguish between AD subjects with high accuracies, which is an interesting result that needs further analysis to improve such performance.\nThe SURF based visual words were not able to detect the atrophy with high accuracies, since it is not effectively able to capture small details. To best of our knowledge, it is showed that multiclass classification can used to distinguish between AD, MC and NC on time and save more time rather than doing binary classification between pair of classes which frequently used before.",

    "IV. CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "In this paper, we proposed a classification system that is based on the visual appearance of MD and FA maps signature generation of hippocampus. SIFT and SURF features were employed to extract content from the anisotropy maps that is then represented using BOW. SVM was employed for the classification task. The obtained results are interesting, to be continued and improve our approach. This extracted signature was used to distinguish the MCI and AD patients from NC, as multiclass classification not only binary classification. The proposed technique, based on maps SIFT visual signature, was able to reach an accuracy of 89 accuracy to discriminate between MCI, AD and NC and 91 for AD and NC. As a futures work, several investigations should studied such as: the impact of the gender (male or female) in the results, the fusion of anisotropy maps in order to boost the classification of the system as well as other ROIs study such as the Amygdala.",

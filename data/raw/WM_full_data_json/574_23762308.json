    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between Ab deposition and white matter pathology (i.e., white matter hyperintensities, WMH) on microstructural integrity of the white matter. Fifty-seven participants (mean age: 7867 years) from an ongoing multi-site research program who spanned the spectrum of normal to mild cognitive impairment (Clinical dementia rating 0-0.5) and low to high risk factors for arteriosclerosis and WMH pathology (defined as WMH volume .0.5 total intracranial volume) were assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) with Pittsburg compound B (PiB) and magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Multivariate analysis of covariance were used to investigate the relationship between Ab deposition and WMH pathology on fractional anisotropy (FA) from 9 tracts of interest (i.e., corona radiata, internal capsule, cingulum, parahippocampal white matter, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal, superior and inferior front-occipital fasciculi, and fornix). WMH pathology was associated with reduced FA in projection (i.e., internal capsule and corona radiate) and association (i.e., superior longitudinal, superior and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi) fiber tracts. Ab deposition (i.e., PiB positivity) was associated with reduced FA in the fornix and splenium of the corpus callosum. There were interactions between PiB and WMH pathology in the internal capsule and parahippocampal white matter, where Ab deposition reduced FA more among subjects with WMH pathology than those without. However, accounting for apoE e4 genotype rendered these interactions insignificant. Although this finding suggests that apoE4 may increase amyloid deposition, both in the parenchyma (resulting in PiB positivity) and in blood vessels (resulting in amyloid angiopathy and WMH pathology), and that these two factors together may be associated with compromised white matter microstructural integrity in multiple brain regions, additional studies with a longitudinal design will be necessary to resolve this issue.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Focal and diffuse lesions in the white matter, seen as hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) (i.e., white matter hyperintensities; WMH) are the most ubiquitous age-related alteration seen in the brain 1. From an etiological perspective, heterogeneity exists with respect to the presence of WMH. On one hand, they are related to cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis 234. On the other hand, they are abundantly present in patients with an underlying amyloid pathology such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 5. Another common pathological change in the aging brain is cerebral b-amyloid (Ab) deposition. Ab is the major component of amyloid plaques and has been hypothesized to initiate a pathogenic cascade that eventually leads to Alzheimers disease (AD) 6. Ab deposition and vascular brain injury frequently coexist 7,8. We recently showed that aggregate coronary disease risk has a moderately strong association with cerebral amyloid deposition 9, consistent with the theory that vascular risk factors (e.g., low high density lipoportein) contribute to AD pathology 10. The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between Ab deposition and WMH pathology, defined as greater than 0.5 of total intracranial volume (ICV) 11, on microstructural integrity of the white matter.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures the organization of fibers within specific white matter tracts 12. An indirect measure of the coordinated directionality and coherence of fibers within a white matter fiber bundle 13, fractional anisotropy (FA) values typically decrease in the presence of pathology such as stroke 14 and WMH 15. Here we used DTI to determine the regional pattern of FA disruption associated with WMH pathology and Ab deposition. Based on previous DTI studies in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal phase of AD, we hypothesized that Ab deposition would be associated with decreased FA in the limbic circuit 1617181920 (e.g., cingulum, parahippocampal white matter, and fornix) and posterior regions of the corpus callosum 21,22. Because the anterior internal capsule and supratentorial white matter are common locations for WMH in the human brain 23, we hypothesized that WMH pathology would be associated with lower FA in projection (e.g., internal capsule and corona radiata) and association (e.g., superior longitudinal, superior and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi) fiber tracts and in the corpus callosum, the major white matter structure involved in intrahemispheric cortico-cortical communication.\nRecent epidemiologic studies have noted that risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) are also associated with increased risk of incident AD 24,25. Moreover, it has been suggested that vascular brain injury may interact with concomitant AD pathology 26. For this reason, we hypothesized that there would be an interaction between Ab deposition and WMH pathology on FA. In particular, we looked for a Ab deposition by WMH pathology interaction in the corpus callosum because Lee et al 27. previously reported differential region-specific associations between AD degenerative and vascular processes on the structural integrity of the corpus callosum.",

Exclusion criteria included evidence of alcohol or substance abuse, head trauma with loss of consciousness lasting longer than 15 minutes, factors contraindicating MRI, and severe medical illness, neurologic or psychiatric disorders unrelated to AD or vascular dementia that could significantly affect brain structure (e.g., schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, liver disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).\nThis study focused on a subset of 57 individuals who had PiB PET and DTI data. The mean time between acquisition of the PiB and DTI imaging data was 3.964.9 months (range: 0-19 months). The subjects received clinical diagnostic evaluations at the Alzheimers Disease Centers at the University of California at Davis and San Francisco.

First, all FA images were resliced to the SPM8 white matter (WM) template using a rigid-body transformation (dimensions: 12161456121 voxels, resolution: 1.5 mm 3 ). Next, the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 atlas package 34, which includes a probabilistic FA atlas and anatomical labels of 50 deep WM ROIs from the DTI data of 81 subjects, was imported into SPM8, coregistered, and resliced to the SPM8 WM template. Next, the resliced FA images were normalized to an intensity-averaged FA template generated from 23 Aging Brain research participants (mean age 7566; 8 female) who had no infarcts and whose WMH burden volume was less than 0.5 of intracranial volume (ICV), considered significant WMH pathology 11, using a diffeomorphic registration algorithm (DARTEL) 35. Finally, the individual FA images and the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 FA atlas were warped to the common space of the averaged FA template generated from 23 VBI-participants, whose DTI data, other than use in creation of the intensity-averaged FA template, were not part of the current analyses. To avoid inclusion of surrounding gray matter or cerebral spinal fluid, DTI values were obtained only in voxels where FA was greater than 0.20.\nBased on the literature and a priori hypotheses, FA were extracted from 9 tracts of interest that included the corona radiata and internal capsule (projection fibers), cingulum gyrus and parahippocampal white matter, and fornix (limbic fibers), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior and superior fronto-occipital fasciculi (association fibers), and corpus callosum.

Distribution volume ratio (DVR) images were created using Logan graphical analysis with PiB frames corresponding to 35-90 minutes post-injection and a gray matter cerebellar mask as the reference region 38,39. The grey matter cerebellum was chosen as the reference region because it is known to be relatively unaffected by fibrillar amyloid in AD and is thus valuable to estimate non-specific PiB binding 39,40. ROIs were defined in each subjects native space using the Desikan-Killiany atlas and the semi-automated FreeSurfer processing stream 41. A global measure of PiB uptake (Global PiB Index) was derived by averaging the mean DVR value from frontal (cortical regions anterior to the precentral gyrus), temporal (middle and superior temporal regions), parietal (supramarginal gyrus, inferiorsuperior parietal lobules and precuneus) and anterior and posterior cingulate ROIs. ROIs that overlapped with large cortical infarcts or cerebellar cortical infarcts were manually edited so that DVR values excluded these regions.\nSubjects were classified as having high or low PiB uptake using a previously described cutoff approach 37. That is, subjects were classified PiB positive if their global PiB uptake was 2 SD above (i.e., .1.08) of the mean PiB index value of 11 young subjects (age range  20-30) unlikely to have amyloid deposition.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In our examination of the effects of WMH pathology and Ab deposition on white matter microstructural integrity, we found that (1) WMH pathology was significantly associated with reduced FA in projection and association fibers. (2) Ab deposition was significantly associated with reduced FA in the fornix and splenium of the corpus callosum. (3) Although there were positive interactions between WMH pathology and Ab deposition on FA in the internal capsule and parahippocampal white matter, accounting for apoE genotype rendered these interactions only marginally significant. Possible mechanisms and interpretations of the interaction are discussed below.\nAs hypothesized, WMH pathology was associated with reduced FA in projection and association fibers. This finding is consistent with earlier reports of an inverse relationship between FA and WMH volume 42, reduced FA in the presence of gliosis or infarcts 43,44, extending beyond normal appearing white matter in subjects with cerebral amyloid angiopathy 45, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) 46, and cognitive impairment with and without vascular dementia 47. These results are also in agreement with prior reports that ischemic brain disease 48,49 and vascular risk 15 alter FA in normal appearing white matter. The projection and association fiber tracts where we detected significant WMH pathology effects also correspond to the cerebral white matter regions with intermediate-high to low baseline anisotropy that Lee and colleagues 15 previously reported were most vulnerable to vascular risk.\nAs hypothesized, Ab deposition was significantly associated with reduced FA in the fornix and selenium of the corpus callosum. Several studies have demonstrated that Ab deposition can lead to DTI changes in mice 50,51. One previous study examined DTI changes associated with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Ab levels in humans and found that Ab42 levels were related to lower FA in medial frontal cortex and underlying white matter 52. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between cerebral Ab deposition and FA. In the current study PiB positivity was associated with lower FA in the fornix, a predominant outflow tract of the hippocampus and a brain region affected early in the course of AD, consistent with previous DTI studies of MCI and AD 535455. PiB positivity was also associated with lower FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum, in accordance with previous ROI-based DTI studies of MCI and AD 56. There is evidence suggesting that vascular brain injury exerts subtle deleterious effects on brain structure and function beyond frank infarction or hemorrhage 575859. For example, epidemiological studies have linked vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) to increased incidence of clinically-diagnosed AD 24,25. Therefore, we hypothesized that there would be an interaction between WMH pathology and Ab deposition on FA. In the current study, we found an interaction between WMH pathology and PiB positivity in the internal capsule and parahippocampal white matter, where PiB-related reductions in FA was greater among participants who also had WMH pathology. However, these interactions were no longer significant after controlling for apoE e4 genotype.\nOne possible mechanism by which WMH pathology and Ab deposition might interact positively to degrade white matter microstructure is through the reduction of brain reserve. Reserve is the concept that there are characteristics of the brain that buffer the impact of pathology on brain performance 60,61. The characteristics may be structural (e.g., extra neurons andor synapses) or functional (e.g., a degree of excess capacity or compensatory mechanisms such that the brain could continue to perform well despite damage 62). There is suggestive evidence that WMHs have a negative effect on structural brain reserve. For example, a population-based study of 1,077 non-demented elderly (60-90 years old) individuals found that greater periventricuar WMH severity was associated with a greater risk for developing dementia. Moreover, the association between WMH and dementia risk was independent of vascular risk factors, cerebral infarcts, and brain atrophy 63. Hypertension, one of the strongest risk factor for WMHs, has also been linked with increased risk of developing AD 64 and treatment of hypertension has been found to be protective against the development of dementia 65. Thus, in the context of the present study, it could be possible that WMH pathology was related to reduced structural brain reserve, which in turn rendered individuals with WMH pathology more vulnerable to the effects of cortical Ab and AD pathology. Although it is not clear how precisely WMH pathology degrades brain reserve, some possible mechanisms include impaired neurogenesis and inflammation. Adult stem cells are located in the subventricular region 66, which is frequently affected by WMHs. Thus, the ischemic changes that lead to the development of WMHs could also cause damage to adult stem cells, impairing neurogenesis. Because there is microglial activation in brain tissue affected by WMHs 67 and higher C-reactive protein levels in patients with WMHs 68, WMH pathology may also negatively impact reserve through inflammatory cytokines. It is noteworthy that the interaction between WMH pathology and PiB positivity were no longer significant after controlling for apoE e4 genotype. This suggests that another explanation for the interaction between WMH pathology and PiB may be apoE e4. Presence of the apoE e4 allele has been associated with increased amyloid deposition in the parenchyma 69 and amyloid positivity. Presence of the apoE e4 allele may also be associated with amyloid deposition in the blood vessels, which could be associated withCAA and WMH pathology 70. Future studies with a longitudinal design will be needed to examine if increased amyloid deposition in each of these regions is in fact associated with decreased white matter microstructural integrity in different regions of the brain.\nThe current findings should be considered in the context of several study limitations: First, the study sample was the small and heterogeneous. Second, apoE genotyping was only available in a subset of subjects. Therefore, our interpretation of the role of apoE in the interaction between PiB positivity and WMH pathology on FA are speculative at best and should be regarded with caution. Other study limitations include the low angular resolution of DTI (6 directions), the fact that we did not account for the location of vascular lesions in our analyses of FA values obtained from 9 white matter tracts that covered most of the supratentorial white matter, and the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Future studies with a longitudinal design will be able to better resolve the nature of the relationship between WMH pathology and PiB positivity on white matter microstructural integrity in different regions of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) has been associated with amyloid and tau pathology, as well as neurodegeneration. Beyond these hallmark features, white matter microstructural abnormalities have been observed using MRI. The objective of this study was to assess grey matter atrophy and white matter microstructural changes in a preclinical mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and free-water (FW) diffusion tensor imaging (FW-DTI). Compared to controls, lower grey matter density was observed in the 3xTg-AD model, corresponding to the small clusters in the caudate-putamen, hypothalamus, and cortex. DTI-based fractional anisotropy (FA) was decreased in the 3xTg model, while the FW index was increased. Notably, the largest clusters for both FW-FA and FW index were in the fimbria, with other regions including the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, forebrain septum, and internal capsule. Additionally, the presence of amyloid and tau in the 3xTg model was confirmed with histopathology, with significantly higher levels observed across many regions of the brain. Taken together, these results are consistent with subtle neurodegenerative and white matter microstructural changes in the 3xTg-AD model that manifest as increased FW, decreased FW-FA, and decreased grey matter density.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, is increasingly prevalent and represents a worsening healthcare burden. Typically, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties and evolve towards increasing cognitive impairment and dysfunctions in complex daily activities 1. At present, there are few disease-modifying therapies available, although some treatments are available to improve AD symptoms 2.\nAD is characterized as a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Post-mortem histopathology has shown the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in patients with AD, as a result of amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and tau aggregation. With the advent of radiotracers with a molecular affinity to amyloid and tau proteins, the spatiotemporal evolution of AD pathology has been characterized in depth using positron emission tomography (PET). Neurodegenerative changes are thought to occur downstream of abnormal protein accumulation, and these changes can be measured during life using either PET tracers or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous studies have shown limited correlation between amyloid pathology and cognitive changes, while both tau pathology and neurodegeneration are thought to be more closely linked to cognition and disease severity 3,4. To better understand the associated pathological changes with AD, preclinical animal models have been developed to recapitulate specific ADassociated features. One of the most widely used models of AD is the triple-transgenic model (3xTg-AD) 5, which exhibits both amyloid and tau pathology, along with cognitive changes.\nStandard structural MRI 6 is a non-invasive technique that can yield information on gross anatomical changes, including hippocampal atrophy 678. VBM is an automated technique that spatially normalizes, segments, and smooths high resolution structural MR images before performing voxel-wise statistical tests to examine differences in brain anatomy between groups. Using VBM, differences in the relative grey matter (GM) density (or concentration) can be compared across groups of subjects on a voxel-wise basis, without the need for a priori regions of interest. While such differences do not directly relate to cellular density 9, the biophysical basis of these differences has been previously attributed to the combined effects of tissue volume changes, vascular changes, and cellular changes such as cell count, distribution, and morphology 101112. This technique has been successfully used to investigate morphological changes in a wide range of neurological disorders, including AD 13,14 and Parkinsons disease 15.\nMore advanced MRI techniques include diffusion MRI (dMRI), which probes the microscopic movement of water throughout the brain 16. The microscopic sensitivity of dMRI can highlight microstructural changes that may be occurring earlier in the disease. For example, previous studies have shown that changes in water diffusivity 17,18, structural connectivity 19, and white matter (WM) microstructural integrity 20,21 are associated with AD. The predominant dMRI technique to assess WM microstructure is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which yields metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Unfortunately, single-shell DTI (the prototypical DTI technique for clinical MRI scanners, defined by a single diffusion b-value) has several limitations that may reduce its accuracy and specificity. For instance, traditional DTI cannot represent multiple and independent intra-voxel orientations within a brain voxel 22; additionally, DTI is sensitive to partial volume effects (PVEs), wherein the resulting DTI metrics reflect a weighted average of multiple diffusion components within a voxel and are thus no longer specific to a single tissue type 23. To overcome this latter limitation, free-water (FW) correction algorithms for DTI (FW-DTI) have been developed 24 and were recently shown to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of WM microstructural analysis in AD 25.\nBecause GM atrophy and abnormalities in the architecture and microstructure of WM have been well demonstrated in human AD 26,27, the purpose of this study was to assess GM density and microstructural differences in WM using VBM and FW-DTI between 3xTg-AD and wild-type (WT) mice. These methods used in combination may yield complementary insight into GM and WM changes in AD mouse models. Additionally, post-mortem histopathology was performed to verify amyloid and tau accumulation in regions across the brain. Ultimately, studies linking GM and WM changes in preclinical models to amyloid and tau deposition could substantiate the link between specific AD pathology and structuralmicrostructural neurodegeneration. Given the link between cognitive decline in humans and neurodegeneration, these studies may provide mechanistic insight into whether GM and WM changes are subsequent drivers of cognitive decline.",

The body temperature was maintained at 38  C using circulating water under the animal. For structural MRI, a gradient echo with flow compensation (GEFC) was acquired with echo time (TE)  6.0 ms, repetition time (TR)  32.0 ms, flip-angle  15  , voxel size (0.1  0.1  0.1) mm 3 , matrixsize  (180  120  88), and field of view (FOV)  (18  12  8.8) mm 3 .

These images were then used to create the group-wise template. Then, all pre-processed GEFC images were coregistered to this template, and the FMRIB Automated Segmentation Tool (fast; FSL) 31 was used to segment the images in template space to create the GM tissue mask. Modulation for the contraction and enlargement from the nonlinear component of the transformation was obtained by multiplying the GM tissue images by the Jacobian of the warp field. The final GM-VBM images (in the group-template space) were smoothed using FMRIB Software Library (FSL).\nDTI pre-processing included brain extraction with AFNI, followed by alignment and eddy current correction by eddy (FSL). FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FW-FA) and FW index were computed by an inhouse MATLAB script. Using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) (http:stnava.github.ioANTs), a b0 group-wise template was created, and all FW-FA and FW images were coregistered to this template by an ANTs non-linear coregistration algorithm. For both VBM and DTI, all statistical analyses were performed in the corresponding group template space.",

Fig. 3 shows the amyloid (6e10 and thioflavin) and tau (AT8) staining in a representative 3xTg-AD mouse and WT mouse. More specifically, higher levels of amyloid and tau can be seen in the hippocampus in the 3xTg mouse, while the WT control mice showed no positive stain in this region. These differences were quantified between groups for thioflavin, 6e10, and AT8 (Fig. 4 and Table 3). For 6e10 (amyloid) and AT8 (tau), all ROIs showed significantly higher pathological burden in the 3xTg cohort compared to the WT controls.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study we used VBM and FW-DTI to investigate complementary changes in GM density and WM microstructure between 3xTg-AD and WT mice. GM density was assessed by VBM; compared with the control group, 3xTg-AD mice showed a decrease in GM density primarily in caudate-putamen, cortex, and hypothalamus. FW-DTI showed differences in WM between groups in different WM areas, including the corpus callosum, fimbria, and forebrain septum. To verify the model phenotype of amyloid and tau pathology, post-mortem histology was performed and showed significant pathology in the 3xTg-AD group.\nIt is well recognized that AD is associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, where atrophy typically occurs early in the hippocampus and is eventually followed by widespread atrophy later in disease 35. On the other hand, atrophy in preclinical mouse models of AD tends to be more subtle and localized 36,37. In the amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPS1) mouse model, which exhibits amyloid pathology, moderate atrophy and ventricular dilation has been observed at 24 months using manual segmentation methods, although these changes largely localized to the midbrain and not in cortical or hippocampal regions. Using an automated VBM analysis, Yang et al. similarly showed isolated midbrain changes in the APPPS1 model at 12 months relative to controls; as the midbrain lacks extensive pathology, this may be attributed to biological variability between the AD model and control mice 38. In that study, the authors also used VBM following injection of an iron-oxide based contrast agent to detect amyloid plaques, showing plaque deposition primarily in cortical and hippocampal regions. Liang et al. measured morphological changes in the APPPS1 transgenic mouse model at 12 months using VBM, finding atrophy of the hippocampus, motor cortex, striatum, amygdala, septal area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and nucleus accumbens in this model of AD 39. In the rTg4510 model that exhibits tau pathological changes, hippocampal atrophy has been previously observed 40. In the present study, we identified lower GM volume in the caudate-putamen, cortex, and hypothalamus of the 3xTg-AD model at 15 months.\nIn studies of human AD, MRI has previously shown that striatal (including caudate and putamen) volume and morphology are altered relative to healthy controls. For example, Jiji et al. showed a significant reduction in the caudate volume in AD 41, while other studies have suggested that caudate atrophy may be an indication of early AD 42. De Jong et al. found that the volumes of putamen and thalamus were significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with probable AD and that volume reduction correlated with impaired global cognitive performance 43. Additionally, hypothalamic atrophy (between 10 and 12 reduction) has previously been detected in several neuroimaging studies in people with AD 44,45. Notably, typical AD pathology such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles is often observed in the hypothalamus of AD patients 44. Therefore, the spatial pattern of decreased GM density found in our study may be in line with previously published findings.\nPrevious imaging studies in the 3xTg-AD model have found reduced hippocampal FA 46, consistent with pathological accumulation of amyloid and tau. Longitudinal changes in WM have also been observed in this model using the diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) model 47. However, another study showed no WM differences in aged 3xTg-AD mice relative to controls using standard DTI 48.\nIn this study, we also evaluated microstructural differences in WM between the two groups. Previous studies using DTI have shown microstructural abnormalities both in the APPPS1 model 49,50 and in the rTg4510 model 40. While one study in the 3xTg-AD model found no WM differences in aged mice relative to controls using DTI 48, other studies have found significant WM changes both crosssectionally and longitudinally 47,515253. Two studies considered early changes at 2 months in the 3xTg-AD model, demonstrating significant changes in diffusion-based biomarkers in regions including the cortex, fimbria, fornix, and dorsal hippocampus 51,53. Interestingly, these changes likely precede significant accumulation of amyloid and tau pathology, and thus the underlying pathophysiological mechanism may be related to altered oligodendrocyte function that adversely impacts myelin production and maintenance 54. A more recent study showed increased FA in the dorsal hippocampus and subiculum in the 3xTg-AD model at 15-21 months, where diffusion changes were found to further correlate with amyloid and tau pathology 52. Of note, the FA changes were inconsistent across these studies, with both increases and decreases in FA observed at early time points and increased FA observed at later time points. While increased FA is generally associated with higher WM integrity, we recently showed that increased FA may be attributed to FW contributions that reduce the accuracy and sensitivity of DTI metrics in the presence of AD-related neurodegeneration 25.\nIn the present study, we used FW-DTI to overcome the limitation of standard DTI related to PVEs. Decreased FW-FAcorresponding to lower WM integritywas primarily observed in the fimbria and corpus callosum, with smaller clusters in the forebrain septum and internal capsule. On the other hand, increased FWconsistent with sub-voxel neurodegenerationwas observed in the fimbria and corpus callosum, as well as the forebrain septum and anterior commissure. Consistent with other studies 47,52,53,55, the fimbria was highly impacted, with 22 of the fimbria showing decreased FW-FA and 24 showing increased FW index. The fimbria-fornix fiber system is the primary connection between the hippocampus and other regions of the brain, and thus it plays a critical role in memory functions. The fimbria-fornix has previously been found to relate to AD in humans 56, with decreased FA and increased mean diffusivity showing potential as predictors of progression in people with AD 57,58. Additionally, the finding of FW-DTI changes in the forebrain septum may be consistent with cholinergic dysfunction, which has been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline 59. Similarly, Falangola et al. showed early changes using DKI in the basal forebrain, which connects to the hippocampus via the septo-hippocampal pathway that includes the fornix-fimbria 55. Taken together, these findings support a role of abnormal cholinergic signaling in this model. Overall, WM microstructural changes in this system might be an important biomarker for diagnosis and progression (or conversion) in AD and mild cognitive impairment.",

      "text": "Significant cluster volumes from VBM analysis, where lower GM density in 3xTg-AD mice was found, inside each relative GM area (Vol ) and the relative t and g values. In addition to significant changes in the fimbria, we observed clusters of altered FW-FA and FW index in the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum connects the two cerebral hemispheres and is the largest WM fiber bundle in the human brain. Previous neuroanatomical studies using different MRI techniques have suggested that the pattern of neurodegeneration in the corpus callosum may give insight into neurodegenerative pathological models, potentially distinguishing between Wallerian and retrogenesis models 26. With DTI, several studies do not report any significant changes in the corpus callosum when AD patients were compared to healthy controls 60,61, while other studies found significant differences in DTI-related metrics between people with AD and healthy controls. For instance, Xie et al. found significant reductions in anisotropy in AD in several WM areas, including the body and the genu of the corpus callosum 62. Additionally, decreased FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum has also been shown using both standard-DTI 636465 and FW-DTI 25. In the 3xTg-AD model, a recent study showed that microscopic anisotropy (mFA) was significantly lower in both the fimbria and corpus callosum compared to control mice, while standard FA showed significant differences in the fimbria and hippocampus 66. Therefore, our results in the 3xTg-AD model Table 2 Significant cluster volumes (Vol), as well as relative t and g values, for WM microstructural differences between groups using FW-DTI analysis. using FW-DTI seem to be in line with previous DTI studies in human AD.\nAs the 3xTg-AD model is associated with both amyloid and tau pathology, we performed post-mortem histopathology to confirm pathology in all animals. To characterize both diffuse and dense plaques, an amyloid co-staining protocol was performed, as well as staining for tau in adjacent slices. Consistent with prior model characterization 28, higher levels of amyloid (6e10 and thioflavin) and tau (AT8) were found in the 3xTg-AD mice compared to WT mice. While 6e10 staining is sensitive to both diffuse and dense core plaques, thioflavin is thought to be more specific to dense plaques, although off-target binding to phospho-tau aggregates has been reported 34. In this study, higher thioflavin staining was identified only in the amygdala, corpus callosum, and hippocampus, while AT8 and 6e10 staining could be observed throughout all regions assessed in the AD model.\nRecent studies have suggested that the 3xTg-AD mouse model has phenotypically drifted from the original line generated over 20 years ago 67. For example, the model now shows clear sex differenceswith females primarily showing AD pathology, although the original characterizations showed less prominent sex differences. Additionally, the original model characterization showed substantial pathology earlier in the disease course, while more recent studies have shown that the pathological burden occurs much later (between 12 and 18 months). As such, the mice used in this study were all females at 15 months of age. Comparisons between studies using this model should consider both biological and methodological differences that could lead to discrepancies between studies. Despite this, these models can provide valuable insight into the pathological characteristics associated with AD pathology.\nThere are several limitations to this study. One limitation is the relatively small sample size, although this sample size is fairly consistent with other neuroimaging characterization in the 3xTg-AD and other mouse models of AD. Additionally, no behavioral assessments were performed, which could give insight into the role of GM density and WM microstructure on cognitive deficits in this model. The dMRI protocol used herein was a single-shell acquisition and did not include higher bvalues that would have allowed characterization of other advanced diffusion biomarkers, such as kurtosis, for comparison with other studies. The use of single-shell dMRI for FW analysis requires several additional assumptions for model fitting, including a lack of exchange of water molecules between brain compartments and that non-Gaussian diffusion decay can be ignored. These assumptions may bias the estimation of FW, as well as the subsequent FW-FA values; as a result, the physical interpretation of the findings herein warrant caution 68. Although this study included both GM and WM metrics, no metabolic, vascular, or functional biomarkers were included. Future studies could characterize these aspects in this model. More generally, one of the challenges that has arisen from preclinical models is that clinical inferences are often limited due to the narrow pathological attributes. Despite this, our results show good agreement with known GM and WM changes in human AD and may give insight into the concomitant impact of amyloid and tau AD pathology on MRI-based biomarkers across species.",

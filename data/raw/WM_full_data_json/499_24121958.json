The present study aimed at investigating the possible relation among white matter damage in DTI, quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power, and cognitive status in Alzheimers disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Forty-seven subjects (8 moderate AD, 18 mild AD, 12 MCI, and 9 healthy controls) underwent brain MR, neuropsychological evaluation, and resting EEG recording. A progressive increase of EEG delta and theta spectral power was observed from controls to patients, mainly in more anterior areas, with a parallel widespread decrease of beta power. Moreover, a progressive decrease of FA from controls to patients in frontal areas and in the corpus callosum (genu) was observed. Correlation analyses indicated convergence among EEG rhythms changes, DTI values, and cognitive status mainly over anterior areas. The decrease of FA values and EEG spectral power changes might represent markers of neurodegenerative dysfunction, possibly preceding macrostructural atrophy.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 50 to 56 of cases at autopsy and in clinical series 1. The principal risk factor for AD is age and the incidence of the disease doubles every 5 years after 65 years of age 2. AD is characterized by gradual loss of memory, difficulties with language, and changes in behavior and leads to death within 3 to 9 years after diagnosis 3. The most recent esteem claims that more than 35 million people worldwide are affected by AD 1.\nLongitudinal studies performed over the past 20 years have demonstrated that in individuals who",

      "text": "eventually develop AD dementia, the cognitive symptoms begin insidiously and, in most cases, progress gradually. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), initially proposed as a predictor of progressive cognitive decline in older adults, later was defined as an amnestic syndrome that denoted a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia (particularly AD) 4,5.\nThe rate of conversion from MCI to AD is approximately 12 per year, which stands in contrast to the 1-2 per year rate for cognitively normal elderly persons; after approximately 6 years, 80 of MCI cohort progressed to dementia 5.\nAD is characterized by biochemical and structural changes at the synaptic level and by damage to the cortical neurons, initially in the temporal lobes and later in the remaining cortex and association areas. Increasing evidence has shown that neuronal degeneration begins in neuronal periphery, such as in the axons and dendrites 6,7. In fact, white matter (WM) changes are also often observed in AD, as seen in structural imaging and neuropathological examinations 8,9.\nConsistently, pathological studies have also revealed various types of WM alterations in AD, such as altered myelin and oligodendrocytes, axonal degeneration, and vascular pathologies 9,10.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique able to evaluate movements of water molecules within the tissue, yielding information on WM integrity by means of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient parameters. In particular, FA calculates the anisotropic water diffusion and reflects the directionality of water motion in cellular structures and, indirectly, their structural integrity. Decreased values of FA are associated to abnormalities of cellular microstructure 11.\nPrevious MRI studies described a decreased FA in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices and of the corpus callosum (CC) in AD patients 121314 and in medial temporal lobe of MCI patients 151617.\nMoreover, DTI data significantly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, indicating that WM degeneration could affect cognitive performance 17. Moreover, a poorer performance in tests exploring executive functions correlated significantly with higher degree of frontal WM changes detected by DTI in AD patients, while no correlation was observed for the controls 18.\nBesides the structural damage, functional abnormalities have also been shown in amnesic MCI (aMCI) and in AD subjects 19,20. Previous studies demonstrated that the hallmark of electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms 19,21. When compared to normal elderly subjects, AD patients have been characterized by high power of delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) rhythms, as well as by low power of the posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) andor beta (13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30) rhythms. An increase in slow EEG power coupled with a decrease in alpha activity was linked to cognitive performance decline in MCI compared to controls 19. These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, cholinergic deficits, etc. Resting state EEG rhythms correlated to global grey matter atrophy and cognitive decline 19,22. Moreover, in aMCI and AD subjects, global power of cortical delta and low frequency alpha rhythms changed as a function of the global cortical atrophy along the disease 22,23.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the possible relationship among structural damage measured by MRI-DTI, functional abnormalities detected by resting state EEG spectral power, and cognitive status in AD and MCI patients. Moreover, we sought to explore whether some of these features can account for different cognitive performances from normal aging to the MCI status to AD.",

The participants were not consecutive cases, thus we aimed at balancing as much as possible age, education, and gender across the groups. The whole sample was composed of 9 healthy controls (HC; 3 males), 12 MCI (9 males), 18 mild AD (10 males), and 8 moderate AD (4 males). Demographic and clinical characteristics of such groups are reported in Table 1. Each patient underwent careful medical, neurological, and neuropsychological assessment. Diagnoses of AD and aMCI were made separately by two experienced neurologists.\nPatients with MCI were diagnosed based on the criteria proposed by Petersen and coworkers 4: 1) memory complaint (preferably corroborated by an informant); 2) memory impairment for age and education; 3) essentially normal general cognitive function; 4) largely preserved activities of daily living; and 5) not demented 4,24. The exclusion criteria for 25. Also, we divided AD patients in two groups, according to the MMSE scores: mild AD (between 26 and 21) and moderate AD (between 20 and 10) 26.\nPatients cognitive performances were rated with a number of standardized diagnostic and severity instruments that included MMSE 26, Clinical Dementia Rating scale 27, GDS 28, Hachinski ischemic scale 29, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale 30.\nNeuroimaging diagnostic procedures (CT or MRI) and complete laboratory analyses were carried out to exclude any other cause of progressive or reversible dementia, in order to have a homogenous AD patients sample. The exclusion criteria included any evidence of: (i) frontotemporal dementia diagnosed according to the criteria of The Lund  Manchester Groups 31; (ii) vascular dementia as diagnosed according to the NINDS-AIREN criteria 32; (iii) extra-pyramidal syndromes; (iv) reversible dementias (including pseudodementia of depression); and (v) Lewy body dementia according to the criteria of McKeith et coworkers 33.\nThe HC were recruited mostly among nonconsanguineous patients relatives. All of them underwent physical and neurological examinations as well as cognitive screening. Subjects affected by chronic systemic illnesses, receiving psychoactive drugs, and with a history of present or previous neurological or psychiatric disease were excluded. All healthy subjects had a GDS score lower than 13 (no depression), and a MMSE score 27.\nAll measurements were performed with the informed and overt consent of each participant (or caregiver when needed), according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee.",

The neuropsychological evaluation battery aimed both to provide a measure of general cognitive efficiency and to assess a wide range of cognitive areas. To this extent, MMSE was used as a global measure of cognitive status. Episodic longterm memory was tested by means of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning, assessing immediate and 15 min delayed recall of 15-word list. Visuospatial long-term memory was tested by means of Rey-Osterrieth complex figure. Verbal and visuo-spatial working memory was assessed by means of backward and forward Digit span and Corsi test, respectively. Language was assessed with oral denomination for objects of real life, while semantic and phonological verbal fluency were evaluated to assess controlled verbal production.\nProblem-solving and abstract reasoning was assessed by means of Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices, focused attention was tested by means of a digit visual search task and constructional praxia was tested asking the subjects to copy some simple pictures.\nFor each test of the battery, raw scores of neuropsychological tasks were corrected for age and education, following normative validation for the Italian population. Then, for each test a normative cut-off score corresponding to the lower limit of the tolerance interval on a 95 one-tailed test, for a confidence level of 95, was calculated on the score obtained by the healthy subjects of the standardization sample.\nTo the extent of statistical and correlation analyses, because of the need for a single and global index, only MMSE mean score was used.",

The EEG recordings were performed (0.3-70 Hz bandpass, notch filtered, linked ear reference) from 19 electrodes positioned according to the International 10-20 System (i.e., Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1; O2). Both the electromyogram and electrooculogram were recorded, in order to identify any epoch contaminated by artifacts and to reject them from the analysis. The electromyogram was recorded from electrodes placed over the submental muscles, with a time constant of 0.03 s. The electrooculogram was recorded by means of bipolar electrodes located about 2 cm above and below the right eye pupil: vertical eye movements were recorded with a time constant of 1 s. Electrode impedance was kept below 5 K . All data were online digitized (256 Hz sampling rate) and stored on a personal computer. Both artifact detection and quantitative analyses were then carried out offline.\nDuring the recording sessions, the participants state of vigilance was controlled by visual inspection of EEG traces and subjects drowsiness (i.e., slowing of EEG, slow eye movements, appearance of sleep spindles, andor K complexes, etc.). The participants were alerted any time behavioral andor EEG signs of drowsiness appeared and corresponding EEG traces were not included in the analyses. Using EEG Lab tool 34, the EEG epochs with ocular, muscular, and other types of artifacts (including those associated with experimenters verbal warnings, behavioral andor EEG signs of drowsiness) were offline visually identified by an expert electroencephalographer, blind to the effective experimental condition, and excluded from the analyses. In no case were the amount of artifact-free EEG epochs results less than 5 minutes.\nAll the signals were analyzed offline using Matlab 2011b (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). During the offline analysis, each EEG recording was divided into 2 s artifact-free epochs that were then submitted to FFT-based spectral power analysis (Welch technique, Hanning windowing function, no phase shift): power values were calculated at each scalp derivation across a 1-30 Hz frequency range for the following frequency EEG bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz). Absolute power for each EEG band was then log-transformed before statistical analyses.",

The images were then manually reoriented according to the line passing through the anterior and posterior brain commissures (AC-PC line) by means of MRIcro software (http:www.cabiatl.commricromricroindex.html). Hippocampal segmentation was performed by two independent tracers, neuroradiologists experienced in hippocampal segmentation, using Multitracer software (http:air.bmap.ucla.eduMultiTracer); the inter-rater agreement coefficient was also calculated. The segmentation was performed by manual delineation of hippocampal boundaries on coronal slices from rostral to caudal direction and using also the sagittal plane as a reference. Due to the wide heterogeneity in the definition of anatomical hippocampal landmarks, the segmentation was performed according to the EADC-ADNI Harmonized Protocol 35. Tracers were both blinded to the clinical diagnosis of patients.\nDiffusion-weighted images were processed with the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) program. Image deformation in the DTI data induced by eddy currents and head movements, were corrected applying a full affine line-up of each image to the mean no-diffusionweighted image. A diffusion tensor model was fit at each voxel, generating FA maps. The neuroradiologists were blind to the clinical diagnosis at the time of image analysis.\nThe manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) allowed us to quantify fractional anisotropy: ellipsoidal ROIs were positioned in the frontal and occipital peri-ventricular WM bilaterally, on the basis of the procedure used by Head and coworkers 36 and atlasbased rules with anatomic landmarks by Mori and coworkers 37.\nIn WM areas of temporal lobes, ROIs were placed at selected axial sections from the beginning of the mammillary bodies and continuing on the next four sections, for a total of five sections as determined on the FA maps 38.\nFor the CC, ROIs were placed on the midsagittal section and continued on the next right and left lateral sections for a total of five sections. The anterior region of CC was defined as the anterior 25 of the CC including the genu, the trunk as the medium 25, and the posterior region of CC as the posterior 25 of CC including the splenium.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating pathological aging processes by comparing neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and cognitive measures. Our results show that a higher frontal WM FA is associated with an increase in beta rhythm on frontopolar and frontal lobe bilaterally, and also on central and temporal ROIs in the left hemisphere. Such a failure of network integration in turn is related with cognitive dysfunction, as revealed by involvement of anterior WM and MMSE score.\nPrevious MR DTI studies in AD patients have demonstrated significant WM abnormalities in the limbic pathways, cortico-cortical association tracts, interhemispheric tracts, and corticospinal tracts 13,39,40, in superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum 41, frontal 14, temporal 14,38, and parietal areas 14.\nConversely, DTI studies on CC have reported controversial findings in AD and MCI; in fact, a FA decrease has been observed in the posterior regions 14,41,42, in anterior areas 43,44, as well as in the genu and the anterior body of the CC 40. Wang and colleagues also reported a decreased FA both in the genu and in the splenium 38.\nIn the present study, we have found a progressive reduction of FA values in frontal regions bilaterally across the different groups (healthy controls, MCI, and mild and moderate AD). Decrease in WM FA could be due to early fronto-temporal disconnections 45 and it can support the so-called retrogenesis theory 46. Such a theory suggests that the progression of AD deterioration proceeds inversely to human ontogenetic myelinization patterns; in this way, frontal WM, which is one of the last regions to mature, would be early altered in AD 45,46. The observation of a predominantly anterior involvement is in line with previous studies measuring brain diffusivity 14 or assessing brain MRI T2-weighted lesions 48 and in our study could be also explained by strict exclusion criteria, especially regarding vascular dementia.\nAnother main finding of the present study is the progressive reduction of DTI values in the genu of CC across the studied groups (from healthy controls to MCI, and to mild and moderate AD). This is in agreement with previous DTI studies 17,43,44,47, which demonstrated a precocious involvement of the anterior callosal regions in MCI and early AD. Also these results support the retrogenesis hypothesis, being the late myelinating fibers, such as those in the genu, are more susceptible to myelin breakdown with respect to those in the splenium, which are supposed to be more resistant to the retrogenesis 46,47,49.\nWe also found a direct relation between FA in frontal regions and cognitive performance in MCI and AD patients. Similarly to previous studies 41,43,48, FA in the genu of CC and in the WM of bilateral frontal regions in AD patients was lower than in healthy controls and strongly correlated with MMSE scores. These results suggest that WM damage in MCI and AD patients is related to the decline of cognitive functions. Previous studies reported significant correlation between diffusion abnormalities and progression of AD, including a relation between FA of the cingulum 40 and of cerebral WM 50,51 and MMSE score.\nOur results are also in line with other DTI studies suggesting a direct relationship between anterior WM damage and executive functions in AD patients 18,51. Again, such results are consistent with recent evidence showing that in mild to moderate AD patients WM hyperintensity involved frontal lobes and was significantly correlated with memory, verbal fluency, and executive performance 50515253.\nAt the functional system level, as previously observed, EEG rhythms differ between healthy controls and patients, featuring an enhancement of the delta and theta rhythms 19,54 and a significant decrement of the posterior alpha rhythm 19,21,55.\nSimilarly, our results have shown that the frontal and frontopolar regions are particularly involved: in these areas, the beta rhythm decreases progressively across groups, paralleling a significant increase of delta and theta rhythms. These EEG features could be seen as a reflection of early and progressive structural damage in frontal areas. Beta rhythm constitutes a dominant feature of human physiological resting EEG, with strong functional correlation to sensorimotor system, motor programming, and attentional and cognitive networks 56. As expected on the basis of these premises, we observed a positive correlation between beta rhythm and cognitive performance evaluated by MMSE scores.\nFinally, integrating structural and functional levels, we found a significant correlation between slowing EEG (delta and theta rhythm) and WM damage on frontal and frontopolar regions across MCI and AD.\nThe current discussion on AD focuses the attention on WM degeneration and argues that this complex chronic neurodegenerative disorder is at least in part due to a dysconnection syndrome 13,39,55. It can be speculated that this depends on the loss of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons projecting to hippocampus and fronto-parietal connections 545556. The same was true for slowing EEG rhythms in AD subjects supposed to have an impairment of cholinergic basal forebrain 54,57,58. Volume reduction of the WM would reflect an impairment of inputoutput cortical information to frontal lobe in MCI and AD subjects, causing a frontal disconnection mode that would pathologically disclose the cortico-fugal EEG rhythms triggering thalamus-cortical delta rhythm 57,59,60.\nA potential limitation of the present study could be the EEG analysis approach. Other EEG analyses could have allowed a functional assessment of brain connectivity providing more complete information on cerebral functioning and, consequently, on related network integrity during cognitive activity or as a consequence of externally produced perturbations 61. On the other hand, since DTI is intrinsically a structural imaging method 11, we chose to correlate it with a simple measure of brain resting state activity, as depicted by EEG spectral power. Nonetheless, future studies could address the more complex relationship between structural integrity of brain connecting fibers and EEG coherence.\nIn conclusion, our results support the hypothesis of abnormal functional integration of different brain regions by disconnection mechanisms 38. In particular, frontal lobes and CC seem to be the earliest and most vulnerable areas to be damaged, as detected by FA. Our EEG data confirm that there is a parallel abnormal function of these areas early involved in the neurodegenerative process affecting cognitive performances. Disruption of structural and functional connectivity among brain regions may represent an early deleterious consequence of synaptic pathologies, occurring prior to clear neuronal death and atrophy.",

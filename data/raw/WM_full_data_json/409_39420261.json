    "abstract": "Background Synaptic degeneration, axonal injury, and white matter disintegration are among the pathological events in Alzheimers disease (AD), for which growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could be an indicator. In this study, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 clinical trajectories and their association with progression and AD hallmarks with white matter microstructural changes were evaluated. Methods A total number of 133 participants were enrolled in GAP-43 and DTI values were compared between groups, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally with two and four-year follow-ups. Subsequently, the correlation between GAP-43 levels in the CSF and DTI values was investigated using Spearmans correlation. Results The CSF level of GAP-43 is negatively correlated with the mean diffusivity measures in Fornix (Cres)Stria terminals in early and late MCI (r s -0.478 p  0.021 and r s -0.425 p  0.038). Additionally, the CSF level of GAP-43 is negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy in the cingulum in late MCI (r s -0.437 p  0.033). Moreover, the axial diffusivity in superior corona radiate (r s -0.562 p  0.005 and r s -0.484 p  0.036) and radial diffusivity in superior fronto-occipital fasciculus was negatively correlated with GAP-43 level in the early and mid-MCI participants (r s -0.520 p  0.011 and r s -0.498 p  0.030). Conclusions Presynaptic marker GAP-43 in combination with DTI can be used as a novel biomarker to identify microstructural synaptic degeneration in the early MCI. In addition, it can be used as a biomarker for tracking the progression of AD and monitoring treatment efficacy.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Worldwide, the incidence of dementia is increasing due to the increasing number of elderly. It is estimated that the number of people with dementia will grow 2.6 times between 2019 and 2050 1. Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, frequently affecting elderly people more than 65 years old throughout the world 2,3. Currently, there are no emerging treatments or approved drugs to reverse, slow, or stop the progressive disease process 4567. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between dementia and normal cognitive aging which is associated with the longlasting pathological deposition of misfolded proteins and synaptic dysfunction in the brain. One of the greatest obstacles researchers face is MCI classification 8,9. Although some MCI patients appear to remain stable or even improve over time, the majority of them change to AD dementia within five years 10. MCI individuals who develop AD dementia are classified as having progressive MCI, and those who retain their MCI state are classified as having stable MCI 11.\nCognitive impairment and behavioral changes consequence from neurodegeneration are commonly observed about 10 years after the onset of proteinopathy. The presence of amyloid-β plaques (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation of self-aggregating tau, which results in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), have effects on disease pathologic progression and serve as biomarkers 8,12. Studies have shown that AD-related pathological changes begin long before clinical symptoms appear. It is widely accepted that synaptic loss and dysfunction play a pivotal role in AD and are associated with cognitive decline 13,14. Thus, additional plasma biomarkers reflecting synaptic loss and dysfunction could further enhance differential diagnosis and are useful as outcome markers in clinical trials, providing new information about the stage of the disease, and preventative assessments.\nGrowth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) has been known as a phosphoprotein of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that is encoded via the GAP-43 gene located in the nervous system 15,16. GAP-43 is essential for synaptic plasticity, reactive synaptogenesis formation, regulation of axonal outgrowth, and memory and learning functions 17. The expression of presynaptic protein GAP-43 highly increases during synaptogenesis and neuronal development and after that in the hippocampus and associated cortex of the human brain 18. Moderate GAP-43 expression can enhance memory, while overexpression of GAP-43 may cause the dysfunction of neuronal synapses and culminate in loss of memory 1,19. CSF GAP-43 levels have seldom been researched in AD patients 10,20. Current evidence suggests a substantial increase in the CSF level of GAP-43 in the early stages of AD 21.\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an MRI-based modality that allows the decoding of the water molecules mobility in vivo and provides information about the white matter (WM) changes, synaptic damage, and neurodegeneration in AD patients 222324.\nEmerging studies point to modifications of WM as a biological marker for pathological importance, which can be a potential target for early-stage dementia 25,26. Early accumulation of CSF and plasma p-tau has been reported in the corpus callosum of a brain with Alzheimers pathology, which is also associated with a decline in WM integrity 27. There have been few studies on whether presynaptic CSF GAP-43 is associated with WM microstructure in MCI subjects, owing to the pivotal biomarker role of GAP-43 for AD 28. In the current study, we carried out an evaluation to elucidate the relationship between GAP-43 levels and DTI-detected changes of WM in patients with MCI. Since GAP-43 is recently proposed to have potential biomarker utility in the AD continuum 14,29, we aimed to investigate where this protein can indicate the microstructural changes in the brain, especially in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment.",

Since the time the project was initiated the ADNI3 content was not fully completed, the participant data were extracted from the ADNI1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI2 projects. Herein we evaluate a total number of 1269 GAP-43 samples from participants who took lumbar puncture. In addition, a total number of 977 DTI samples were extracted from the database. To perform a comparison between the GAP-43 and DTI values following screening was taken. After a glance at the data, 464 duplicated values for the ID of patients were detected; therefore 804 unique IDs were isolated. To compare DTI data with gap-43 data, datasets were combined based on ID and the year of the sample taken, therefore, 133 values remained. Moreover, to compare the amount of GAP-43 and DTI in different years, IDs containing repetitive GAP-43 values were analyzed separately (Fig. 1).",

      "text": "To measure the GAP-43 level in the CSF, in-house ELISA techniques were implemented. The performing procedure is briefly described as follows: admixture of the anti-GAP-43 antibody of the mouse (0.77 µgml NM4) with Nunc-Immuno Polysorp microwell modules (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, US) in the pH of 9.6 provided by carbonate buffer in 4 C temperatures.\nMoreover, in the measurement procedure, three containers were labeled as CSF, blank, and control samples. Subsequently, the samples were colorized with 3, 3, 5, 5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, KemEnTech Diagnostics). The color density at 450 nm was measured through a SunriseTM microplate absorbance reader (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland) by considering a reference value of 650 nm. The C-terminal of GAP-43 was a cue for two mouse monoclonal and polyclonal GAP-43 antibodies; the first was NM4 as a coating antibody, and the second was a polyclonal GAP-43 antibody as a detector antibody. Finally, all laboratory data (1268 samples) were analyzed to determine the exact concentration of GAP-43 indicated by pgmg in the range of 312 -20.000 pgmL. Quality control samples named QC1 and QC2 were taken from patients CSF in collaboration with the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and Mölndal, Sweden. Detailed information was available in the previously published article 14.",

Wholebrain MRI scanning on 3 Tesla GE Medical Systems scanners was taken from participants and DTI values of participants were derived from raw MRI data according to the ADNI protocol. Besides, to assess the quality of MRI images in finding possible artifacts, visualization was performed. The image acquisition properties for Anatomical T1-weighted SPGR (spoiled gradient echo) sequences were as follows. The flip angle was selected as 11 in a 256  256 matrix. The voxel size was selected with the values of 1.0  1.0  1.2 mm 3 . Moreover, three values for Echo time (TE), Repetition Time (TR), and Inversion time (TI) were selected as 2.85 ms, 6.98 ms, and 400 ms, respectively. Besides, the value for diffusion-weighted images (DWI) was as follows: A matrix size of 256  256, total scan time of 9 min, 9000 ms for TR, and voxel size of 2.7  2.7  2.7 mm 3 . To achieve an improved signal-tonoise ratio, for every DTI scan, 46 images were acquired: 5 T2-weighted images without diffusion sensitization (b0 images), and 41 diffusion-weighted images for which the b-value was set at 1000 smm². To ensure quality assurance, all T1-weighted MR, FLAIR, and DWI images underwent a visual review to identify and exclude those with substantial motion, artifacts, or high white matter hyperintensities ( 2.5 standard deviations from the mean in the AD group).",

In addition, in the T1-weighted anatomical scans, extra-cerebral tissue was roughly removed by employing a range of software packages, with significant processing reliance on ROBEX-an automated program that has been previously trained on manually skull-stripped MRI data 31 and FreeSurfer 32. The skull-stripped volumes were visually assessed, and the most appropriate one was chosen, occasionally undergoing additional manual editing. Anatomical scans were then subjected to intensity inhomogeneity normalization via the MNI nu_correct tool (www.bic.mni.mcgill. casoftware). In addition, non-brain tissue was removed from the DWI through the application of the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from FSL 33. To achieve alignment of data from different subjects within the same 3D coordinate system, each T1-weighted anatomical image was subjected to linear alignment with a standard brain template, (downsampled Colin27), using FSL flirt 34 with six degrees of freedom (dof ) to permit translations and rotations in three dimensions. In order to mitigate susceptibility artifacts resulting from echo-planar imaging (EPI), which can produce distortions at tissuefluid boundaries, skull-stripped b0 images were linearly aligned (FSL flirt with 9 dof ) and then elastically registered to their respective T1-weighted structural images via an inverse-consistent registration algorithm that utilized a mutual information cost function 35. Following the generation of the 3D deformation fields, these were applied to the other 41 DWI volumes prior to the assessment of diffusion parameters. To ensure proper alignment of the DWI images with the structural T1-weighted scan, a corrected gradient table was computed.",

By performing a longitudinal analysis, it could be perceived that GAP-43 changes are mainly revealed after four years. Although both groups of normal and early MCI experience significant changes with a p-value less than 0.05, the rate of the changes is higher compared to normal individuals according to mean differences. The GAP-43 measurements in the late MCI with the four-year follow-up were excluded due to the extremely limited sample size (Table 2).\nThe increase in the level of CSF GAP-43 can be defined by taking a glimpse of each groups GAP-43 level changes per year. As is illustrated in Fig. 2, normal participants experienced a slight alternation in the GAP-43 value, whereas the early MCI group experienced a high rate of fluctuation even up to approximately 1200 pgmL.

Since our data contains right-handed participants, we implement our analysis on the left hemisphere of the individuals. By performing Friedman analyses considering twoyear follow-ups in three visits, the following results were obtained. In the early MCI group, a significant change was observed in the cerebral peduncle (p  0.022) and posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) (p  0.009), in the AxD and FA values, respectively. Unlike FA, for the AxD and MD parameters of DTI, the Retrolenticular part of the internal capsule (RPIC) revealed significant change among late MCI participants (p  0.001 and p  0.011). Posterior thalamic radiation revealed significant changes in the normal, early and late MCI group. Moreover, the cingulum cortex depicted significant changes in late MCI compared to normal participants in the FA parameter (p  0.004), nevertheless, in the RD parameter there is a significant change in both normal and late MCI groups (p  0.013 and p  0.019). The significant values of the cerebellar peduncle, Genu of the corpus callosum, and Medial lemniscus are hypothesized to be the consequence of normal aging rather than MCI state. Fornix (cres)Stria terminalis is another important pathway that is damaged with a remarkable value among MCI participants (FA: early MCI p  0.022, late MCI p  0.002; MD: early MCI: p  0.016). AxD, MD, and RD parameters in the late MCI group specified significant changes in the sagittal stratum (p  0.005, p  0.005, and p  0.007), and Superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p  0.003, p  0.001, and p  0.001). The cingulum (hippocampus) tract is highlighted for the early MCI signal alternation in AxD and MD (p  0.033 and p  0.032). The AxD anterior and Superior corona radiata neural tract has remarkable changes in the late MCI stage (p  0.002 and p  0.004), in contrast to the Posterior corona radiata. The FA value of the Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus is not suggested to be involved in the MCI brain changes, since the value is too close to the p-value threshold (p  0.047). Eventually, the changes in DTI values started from the posterior part of the brain (Posterior corona radiata) and continued to the anterior part of the brain (Anterior corona radiata) (Fig. 3).

Based on the results it could be concluded that the GAP-43 value highly correlated with the DTI parameters in the early MCI groups (Suppl Table 2).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The current study performed a longitude analysis on the level of CSF GAP-43 over two and four years of followups, in which the level of GAP-43 revealed a significant increase after four years. Moreover, changes in the DTI values in different brain areas were assessed after two years of follow-up. Finally, an analysis to reveal the correlation between the GAP-43 and the areas of the brain with high changes in DTI values in the disease group was performed.\nIn the Zhu et al. study, the project initiated with a hypothesis mentioning an increase in CSF GAP-43 levels in AD and MCI subjects. The results acknowledge the fact that the GAP-43 level had a direct correlation with the AD stage determined by the MMSE score. Furthermore, GAP-43 was specified as a potential biomarker for AD follow-up since MCI to AD progression became predictable by tracking the level of CSF GAP-43 39. Accordingly, the result of our study depicted an enhancement in the GAP-43 value in the different stages of AD, which became significant after four years of follow-ups. Another study with a huge sample size of 787 participants enrolled from the ADNI database implemented a regression model to link CSF GAP-43 to AD progression and other biomarkers. The results illustrated a correlation between CSF GAP-43 and AD stage as well as tau level (r  0.768, P  0.001) and neuroimaging hallmarks such as the volume of the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus 40. In this regard, the current study demonstrated a correlation between CSF GAP-43 and DTI parameters in AD patients and revealed a significant correlation between GAP-43 value and DTI parameters in the early MCI. Just a short time before the results of Qiang et al. study became online; Öhrfelt et al. published a similar article with the same sample size of 787 participants from the ADNI database searching for the correlation between GAP-43 and Amyloid-beta (Aβ) level. The study result reported a higher risk of AD progression in participants with positive Aβ and a high amount of CSF GAP-43, represented by a hazard ratio of 8.56. Meanwhile, the study reported a correlation between GAP-43 and Aβ measured by positron emission tomography (PET) scan 41. Likewise, it could be mentioned in our study that the mean level of GAP-43 was higher in late MCI in comparison to the normal and early MCI groups. Besides, our result related to GAP-43 was justified by the Zhang et al. study. Similar to our study, Zhang et al. mentioned the potential role of GAP-43 in the prediction of dementia onset in follow-ups over a period of 2 or 4 years 28.\nIt is worth mentioning the result of the Nabizadeh et al. study in which the correlation of the neurofilament light (Nfl) was calculated in different brain white matter tracks in AD patients from the ADNI database. The result revealed a negative correlation of Nfl with FA value in the fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, fornix, corpus callosum, corona radiata, and internal capsule, whereas there was a positive association between the sagittal stratum, hippocampal cingulum, cingulum, and thalamic radiation in AxD, MD, and RD values of DTI 27. In our study, the AxD value of superior corona radiate and RD value of superior fronto-occipital fasciculus had a negative correlation with GAP-43 level in the early and mid-MCI participants. In addition, the MD value of Fornix (cres)  Stria terminalis has a negative correlation in early and late MCI, and the FA value of cingulum (hippocampus) has a positive correlation in late MCI. In addition to the correlation of DTI values with Nfl, there is a positive correlation between CSF values of Nfl and GAP-43 (r  0.36, p  0.015) 42. Finally, in Bergamino et al. research, the DTI imaging technique was specified as a potent application in the detection of microstructural changes in AD. The main imaging hallmark to differentiate AD, MCI, and normal participants was reported as the FA value of fornix and corpus callosum 43. Accordingly, based on our results, Superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, Retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, fornix, and FA value of cingulum were potential DTI biomarkers for categorizing normal, MCI, and AD participants with two years follow-ups.\nIn the Velazquez et al. research analyzing the ADNI data, the hippocampal volume was determined as a biomarker for predicting the progression of MCI to AD 44. For the early stage of AD, Mondragón et al., who worked on the ADNI database, documented the anterior cingulate cortex as the indispensable part involved in this stage 45. Similarly, in our study, the AxD, MD value of the connection of the cingulum to the hippocampus was a biomarker to differentiate the early and late stages of MCI due to its significant changes over two years. Moreover, in a previously published study, the MD value of the hippocampus was significantly higher in the MCI and AD groups 46. Since the MD value is sensitive to necrosis as well as edema and an increase in AxD value could be an indication of higher CSF density 47, it could be concluded that the positive correlation of cingulum (hippocampus) MD and AxD value with GAP-43 detected in the late MCI and AD groups were suggested to be due to necrosis and CSF replacement in these areas. Nir et al. study, which performed analysis on 155 ADNI participants, specified the FA parameter of the DTI as the least sensitive in defining the AD stages 30. Conversely, in our study, the FA value of the cingulum could be used as a marker of AD stages since it had a remarkable difference in following up on the early and late stages of AD.\nA combination of GAP-43 and DTI measurements could be a diagnostic and monitoring biomarker to differentiate the early stage of MCI from normal participants. Previous studies mentioned different imaging biomarkers for AD severity. For instance, evaluating microstructural changes detected by DTI highlighted a reduction in the fiber number of perforant pathway along with a reduction in FA values of the entorhinal layer II. These results specified the involvement of the entorhinal-hippocampal pathway not only in AD participants but also the preclinical AD 48. Another study applied Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in the AD group to detect iron accumulation in the tissue as an indicator of AD pathology landmark 49. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) imaging tools are another novel imaging technique to assess the pathology of AD. These techniques including ASL-based measuring BBB water exchange rate and DCE-MRI measuring BBB permeability provide precious data regarding the BBB dysfunction in AD 50. Moreover, the combination of QSM and DP-pCASL to analyze brain iron dynamics as well as BBB function to monitor the AD severity along with AD pathology provides promising biomarkers for AD 51.\nThe main limitation in performing this study was the low number of participants after applying filters for patients who took DTI and lumbar punctures for GAP-43. Express differently, the inclusion criteria of our protocol only included patients who took lumbar puncture for GAP-43 evaluation along with DTI imaging in the same year to minimize the possible bias in finding a correlation between the level of GAP-43 and DTI values.",

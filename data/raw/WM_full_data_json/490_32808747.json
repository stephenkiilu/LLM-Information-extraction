    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microstructural alterations as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are key findings in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and small vessel disease (SVD). We determined the contribution of each of these conditions to diffusion alterations. METHODS: We studied six samples (N365 participants) covering the spectrum of AD and SVD, including genetically-defined samples. We calculated diffusion measures from DTI and free water imaging. Simple linear, multivariable random forest, and voxel-based regressions were used to evaluate associations between AD biomarkers (amyloid-beta, tau), SVD imaging markers, and diffusion measures. RESULTS: SVD markers were strongly associated with diffusion measures and showed a higher contribution than AD biomarkers in multivariable analysis across all memory clinic samples. Voxel-wise analyses between tau and diffusion measures were not significant. DISCUSSION: In memory clinic patients, the effect of SVD on diffusion alterations largely exceeds the effect of AD, supporting the value of diffusion measures as markers of SVD.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are the two leading causes of cognitive decline and dementia. 1 Altered white matter microstructure is considered a key finding in both conditions 2,3 and has consistently been associated with cognitive deficits. 4-6 The most commonly used method to study white matter microstructure in vivo is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which quantifies diffusion properties of water molecules in brain tissue. 7,8 The typical finding described in both AD and SVD is an increase in the extent of water diffusion (mean diffusivity) and a decrease in diffusion directionality (fractional anisotropy), which can be detected both globally and regionally. 4,5 Despite the wide use of diffusion alterations as efficient disease markers and their strong associations with clinical deficits, little is known about their underlying pathology.\nIn memory clinic patients, AD and SVD often co-exist. 9 The extent to which each of these conditions contribute to diffusion MRI alterations is largely elusive. Free water imaging, an advanced diffusion model, improves the specificity of the DTI model and could therefore provide additional insight into the origin of diffusion MRI alterations. 10 As such, free water imaging might be able to disentangle the effects of AD and SVD. 11121314 Previous studies using DTI or free water imaging were limited by the lack of biomarker evidence of AD pathology or insufficient consideration of mixed pathology. Assessing the individual contributions of AD and SVD towards diffusion MRI alterations requires a systematic study covering the entire spectrum of pure AD, mixed disease, and pure SVD.\nThe uncertainty regarding the origin and interpretation of diffusion alterations in memory clinic patients impedes widespread implementation in research and clinical practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of AD and SVD on diffusion MRI in a memory clinic setting. We examined associations between biomarkers of AD, MRI markers of SVD, and diffusion measures from both conventional DTI and free water imaging. Six study samples (N365 participants) were included to systematically cover the entire spectrum of AD, mixed disease, and SVD, and to account for both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) markers. In addition to the common memory clinic setting with predominantly mixed disease, our analysis also included patient samples with pure, genetically-defined AD or SVD. This enabled us to examine effects of both diseases on diffusion measures without confounding pathology. Analyses were performed separately within each sample in order to validate results and address generalizability using the six independently recruited samples.",

Variables were power transformed in case of nonnormal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test).\nTo perform multivariable analysis in the presence of multicollinearity (i.e. intercorrelations among disease markers, Supplementary Fig. 1), we used random forest regressions (R package party; version 1.3-2). 29 This method allows to assess the contribution of each AD biomarker, SVD marker, age, and sex to diffusion alterations, while accounting for all other variables. For each sample, we calculated 1501 conditional inference trees with unbiased variable selection and default parameters as previously described. 11 We calculated conditional variable importance together with a 95 confidence interval from 100 repetitions.\nAn effect of Aβ on diffusion measures might be mediated by vascular pathology, in particular cerebral amyloid angiopathy, i.e. Aβ accumulation in perforating vessels. 30 To address this possibility, we performed a post-hoc mediation analysis (R package lavaan; version 0.6-4) 31 in samples where simple regression analysis showed an effect of Aβ on diffusion measures. Diffusion measures were entered as dependent variables, Aβ as independent variable, WMH volume as mediator, and age as covariate. Standard errors were based on bootstrapping (1000 iterations).\nBecause amyloid pathology has been shown to strengthen the association between tau accumulation and structural tract alterations as assessed by diffusion measures, 32 we performed two additional analyses within each sample. First, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to amyloid-positive individuals by repeating simple regression analyses. Second, we assessed the interaction effect of tau  Aβ on diffusion measures.\nFinally, since tau is a localized pathology starting in the entorhinal cortex, 33 we also performed regional analyses between voxel-wise diffusion measures and tau in the PET samples, i.e. ADNI and SVCI. We used permutation test theory with a standard general linear model as implemented in randomise (FSL). We assessed associations between both global tau PET SUVR scores as well as regional tau PET SUVR scores in the entorhinal cortex and voxel-wise diffusion measures. The number of permutations was set at 5000. Significant voxels within the skeletonized diffusion measure maps were identified using threshold-free cluster enhancement with 2D optimization and P  0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We investigated the effect of AD and SVD on brain microstructure assessed by diffusion measures. As a unique feature, our study included six independently recruited samples covering the entire spectrum of AD, mixed disease, and SVD. The main finding is that in memory clinic patients, diffusion MRI alterations are largely determined by SVD. Results were consistent across all memory clinic samples, illustrating the robustness of our findings. Our study facilitates the interpretation of diffusion MRI alterations and the development towards clinical application.\nThe strong effect of SVD on diffusion measures was evident in all of the six study samples. In contrast, an association between AD and diffusion measures was only detectable in DELCODE and DIAN. While in DELCODE effect sizes of AD biomarkers were considerably smaller than those of SVD markers, effect sizes of Aβ 42 and WMH volume were similar in DIAN. Multivariable analyses using random forest regression showed a higher importance of SVD markers for diffusion alterations in all memory clinic samples. The only sample in which AD biomarkers had a higher variable importance was DIAN. As expected for a genetically-defined sample, these patients are considerably younger than typical memory clinic patients and less likely to show age-related comorbidities, such as SVD. Still, mediation analysis in DIAN suggested a vascular contribution to diffusion alterations also in this population, as the effect of Aβ on diffusion alterations was partly mediated by WMH volume. This might indicate a contribution of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a specific subtype of SVD caused by deposition of Aβ in perforating vessels. 30 Since the DIAN sample also included asymptomatic mutation carriers up to 15 years before estimated symptom onset, another explanation is that the association between Aβ and diffusion measures is strongest in early, preclinical AD. This view is supported by a recent study demonstrating an association between Aβ and diffusion measures over the adult lifespan in cognitively healthy participants. 36 Overall, we conclude that while the effect of AD on diffusion measures is apparent in DIAN patients with pure and early AD, the presence of SVD in the memory clinic samples masks the effect of AD on diffusion measures.\nSeemingly in contrast with our results, associations between AD biomarkers and alterations of white matter microstructure as assessed by DTI have been previously reported in memory clinic patients, 13,14,32,34,373839 although some studies found no association. 40,41 Importantly, however, only one of these studies accounted for SVD. Hence, the effect of AD on diffusion alterations might have been overestimated. Only Strain and colleagues 34 considered biomarkers of both diseases and found an association between tau PET (but not Aβ PET) in temporal regions and diffusion measures in temporal white matter projections, independently of WMHs. In line with our results, the effect size for WMH volume was larger than effect sizes of AD biomarkers. By considering both diseases, we conclude that SVD determines diffusion alterations to a much larger extent than AD, even in samples where AD was the clinically predominant disease. The strong effect of SVD has implications for future studies, which will need to take SVD into account as an important confounder, as well as for the interpretation of diffusion MRI alterations in clinical routine.\nIn the current study, neither the regional analysis nor the analysis in amyloid-positive individuals, where the effect of tau was expected to be stronger, 32 indicated a significant association between tau and diffusion measures. In post-mortem studies, white matter alterations in AD patients have been attributed to axonal degeneration secondary to cortical deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau. 42,43 Yet, post-mortem studies by design examine patients in very late stages of AD, while our memory clinic patients were mostly in earlier disease stages. Thus, it is conceivable that our patients have not yet reached the disease stage where associations between tau and axonal degeneration can be detected.\nBy design, our memory clinic samples were heterogeneous, which in our view accurately reflects a real-life memory clinic setting. To study pure forms of AD and SVD, we included genetically defined samples. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis in subgroups with amyloid-positive individuals allowed to study memory clinic patients who met the biological definition of AD. Although statistical power was reduced, the strong effect of SVD on diffusion measures was also confirmed in these subgroups.\nOur finding that diffusion alterations are predominantly driven by SVD is also supported by a genome-wide association study in the population-based UK Biobank. Polygenic risk scores for altered DTI measures were associated with SVD-related stroke and major depressive disorder, but not with AD. 44 The study thus provided genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying diffusion alterations are shared with cerebrovascular disease.\nAnother aim of this study was to investigate whether free water imaging allows to disentangle the contribution of SVD and AD. The finding that SVD markers showed strongest associations with FW corroborates previous results indicating that diffusion alterations in SVD patients are predominantly driven by an increase in the free water content. 11 However, our current analysis did not provide evidence that AD biomarkers are reflected in the tissue compartment. The latter result is in contrast to studies suggesting that AD-related neurodegeneration of the white matter might be specifically represented in free water corrected tissue measures: Tissue measures were associated with conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia in AD patients 12 and showed Aβ-related longitudinal changes. 14 It should be noted that the current study was cross-sectional and thus we cannot exclude that the tissue compartment holds valuable information for longitudinal studies. 12,14 Furthermore, multi-shell diffusion data, which would be necessary for more complex parametrization of the fluid compartments, 454647 was not available in the study samples. This would have allowed to control for the effects of capillary blood flow (intravoxel incoherent motion) in the free water estimation. 47 A limitation of our study is that elevated tau (especially in CSF) is not specific for AD as it could also indicate other tauopathies, such as Picks disease, corticobasal degeneration, or progressive supranuclear palsy. However, the tau PET tracer ( 18 FAV-1451) employed mostly binds to tau deposits specific for AD. 48 Also, the focus on recruitment of clinical AD, e.g. by including amnestic mild cognitive impairment in DELCODE and ADNI, clearly enriched for AD rather than other tauopathies. Another limitation is the lack of AD biomarkers in the CADASIL sample. Yet, the purpose of the CADASIL sample was to judge the effect sizes of SVD markers in genetically-defined disease, i.e. in young patients with pure SVD. Interestingly, we found similar effect sizes as in SVD focused samples with mixed pathology, in particular the UVCI sample. While we also included voxel-based analyses to identify regional associations, our study mostly focused on global, whole-brain averages of diffusion measures. Thus, we cannot exclude that analyses in specific subregions will yield different results. Because of limitations in the diffusion MRI acquisition protocols (no reversed phase-encoding, directions not sampled on entire sphere), we were not able to correct for susceptibility-induced distortions or to employ a more modern approach for correction of eddy current-induced distortions, motion, and outlier slices. 49 Finally, the lack of pathological confirmation of the presence and extent of AD and SVD pathology originates from the paucity of autopsy studies with high quality, standardized antemortem diffusion MRI.\nThe main strength of our analysis is the inclusion of multiple samples from different countries and ethnicities, covering the entire spectrum of AD, mixed disease, and SVD. This has enabled us to independently validate results and to assess both CSF and PET biomarkers of AD in a robust manner. The differences in study protocols among the six samples, such as MRI acquisition, biomarker assessment techniques, and recruitment strategies indicate that our results might be generalizable to other populations along the spectrum of AD and SVD. We also included younger individuals with genetically-defined disease to minimize confounding by other age-related pathologies. Finally, the state-of-the art diffusion imaging analysis pipeline included modern pre-processing techniques and rigorous control for confounding by CSF partial volume effects, which is crucial in patients with atrophy and therefore enlarged CSF spaces.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that the effect of SVD on diffusion alterations largely exceeds the effect of AD. Our systematic analysis contributes to the interpretation of diffusion MRI in memory clinic patients and further advances its application in clinical practice. We validate diffusion measures as markers for SVD and as valuable tools to assess the vascular contribution to AD and dementia, which still needs to be adequately explored. 50 Building upon our findings, future studies could assess if more advanced parameterization of diffusion processes, such as biophysical diffusion models, further increases the sensitivity in earlier or even asymptomatic stages.",

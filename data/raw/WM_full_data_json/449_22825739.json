One gene relevant to the individual variation in acquiring HAD may be Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). We aimed to investigate the relationship of ApoE genotype to neuropsychological function and white matter integrity of the corpus callosum in a region of interest a priori analysis of HIV-positive subjects with clade C HIV. Forty-five subjects underwent ApoE genotyping, neuropsychological testing, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Subjects (n  24) with at least one e4 allele when compared to subjects with no e4 allele (n  19) had significantly decreased immediate and delayed recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (p  0.05) and significantly decreased fractional anisotrophy in the corpus callosum (p  0.007). These data indicate that the e4 allelic variant of ApoE is associated with memory impairment and white matter damage of the corpus callosum in HIV-positive subjects.",

      "text": "HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder affecting up to 30  of people with AIDS 1. Host genotype may affect the pathogenesis of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS). One gene relevant to the individual variation in acquiring HAD may be Apolipoprotein E (ApoE).\nApoE functions in cholesterol transport and is produced by macrophages, glial cells, and neurons in the CNS 2. The three major allelic variants of the ApoE locus namely e2, e3, and e4 encode these three main isoforms of ApoE 3. The presence of the e4 variant has been found to be associated with increased plasma cholesterol levels and decrease longevity, presumably due to increased vulnerability of neurons to oxidative stress 4. Thus, the prevailing view is that the e4 allele confers a detrimental effect in non-infectious neuropsychiatric diseases, for example, doubling the lifetime risk of Alzheimers disease (AD).\nIt has also been hypothesized that ApoE may also play a role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Microglia infected by HIV are chronically activated and over express cytokines associated with microglia-amyloid plaque interactions 5. Thus, the response of the nervous system to HIV infection may be at least in part genetically determined by the presence or absence of the gene encoding the e4 variant. Direct toxic effects of viral proteins (such as gp120) for neurons and less effective repair in e4 subjects 6 may play a role. Elevations in the levels of CSF amyloid-beta among HAD patients have been demonstrated to mirror a pattern seen in AD 7. An autopsy study found argyrophilic plaque prevalence in AIDS increased to levels approaching those found in Downs syndrome 8. Therefore, a stimulus to an inflammatory response in the brain may favour argyrophilic plaque formation 8.\nNevertheless, data on the relationship between e4 and HAD are not consistent 2. In some work, HIV-infected subjects with the e4 allele for ApoE have an excess of dementia and peripheral neuropathy 5 or have worse than expected neuropsychological performance 5. On the other hand, a number of studies have found no correlation between ApoE genotypes and risk of HAD 9. Results of a large-scale genetic-epidemiological study found increased risk for disease progression but no increase in HAD in HIV-positive individuals who had ApoE e4e4 genotype 10. Multiple studies have found neuropsychological differences between pre-clinical Alzheimers disease subjects with the e4 allele for ApoE and those without the e4 allele 11.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantifies the magnitude and directionality of tissue water mobility, thereby permitting the examination of white matter injury by measuring two indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects the orientation specificity of water diffusion, and mean diffusivity (MD), which reflects the degree of water diffusion within an imaging voxel 12. A number of DTI studies in HIV have reported white matter damage to the corpus callosum 131415. DTI has been used to identify age-related brain changes 16 and white matter alterations in a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease 17. E4 genotype is associated with reduced FA on DTI of the corpus callosum and medial temporal lobe even before the onset of Alzheimers dementia 18. Furthermore, e4 carriers had a higher subcortical WML volume than did subjects with the e3e3 genotype 19.\nWe therefore hypothesized that in clade C HIV-1 infection, the e4 allele would be associated with impaired performance on neuropsychological tests and with poorer microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum on DTI in a region of interest a prior analysis.",

To be eligible, participants were required to have a positive diagnosis of HIV infection made within the last 6 months (based on serologic testing by ELISA and Western blot), to have not previously used anti-retroviral medications (HAART naı ve), and to have at least 7 years of formal education.\nThe presence of other current DSM-IV disorders determined through semi-structured interviews using the MINI was an exclusion criterion. Patients were also excluded if they were using psychotropic medication or had a recent (6 month) substance abuse history as defined by responses to the alcohol use disorders inventory (AUDIT) and the Substance abuse and mental illness screener (SAMISS). Individuals who scored greater than 16 on the beck depression inventory were excluded from the study. Patients were also excluded if they reported a lifetime history of head injury or neurological disease or a central nervous system opportunistic infection. MRI and neurological examination were used to exclude a current central nervous system disorder, as this may be more prevalent in stage III HIV.",

      "text": "Eddy current correction was performed separately in each of the three acquisitions using affine transformations in FSL (Oxford Center for MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). The data were then imported to MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) for further registration and diffusion tensor calculation by in-house developed tools 22,23. Co-registration was performed across the three acquisitions using affine transformations with the unweighted image of the first average as a reference. For each of the three acquisitions, diffusion tensors were calculated and outliers were rejected by first calculating Z-scores based on 25 and 75 percentile limits and then discarding data points more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. The three acquisitions were then averaged and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were calculated. Diffusion tensors and fractional anisotropy (FA) images were then derived. An affine as well as a nonlinear registration of the B0 images to each subjects structural T1 image (intra-subject) was performed. The warps were applied to the FA images. A mean FA template was then created from all the subjects followed by a final registration and warp of all the FA images to the mean template. The same registration transforms were applied to the MD images.\nComparisons between HIV-positive groups (e4? and e4-) were then drawn to examine the associations between HIV infection, ApoE and white matter integrity in the corpus callosum. A further analysis of FA and MD of the corpus callosum in the homozygous e4? group was also compared to the heterozygous e4? group.",

    "Statistical analysis": {
      "text": "Descriptive statistics were computed to describe the sample in terms of age, education, gender distribution, and other demographic characteristics. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to determine whether there were differences across groups in neuropsychological performance. A general linear model ANOVA was performed in a voxel-wise manner on the FA and MD of each cohort to determine significant differences between the groups. This was performed at a p  0.01 threshold with a FA mask of0.25. A method reported by Forman et al. 24 to correct for multiple comparisons was used by setting a cluster threshold of 10 voxels. Any clusters that survived this extent threshold were reported to be significant. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to confirm whether non-carriers (e4-) and the e4? carriers differed from one another on corpus callosum FA, using FA values for the significant clusters in the corpus callosum that were extracted for each participant using FSL. In order to establish whether the allelic frequency was randomly distributed in this sample, we conducted an analysis of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). In particular, this principle asserts that mating is random; there is no migration or inbreeding and no selective survivorship. Calculation of the HWE allows the investigator to report with some confidence that external factors have not altered the gene frequency in the population to any significant degree and therefore that the observed frequency is not an artefact of these external factors.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "Of the 45 subjects originally enrolled, 43 participants were included in the final analysis. All subjects were of Xhosa origin. The Xhosa are an Nguni speaking group predominantly found in the Western and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa. The imaging data from two subjects in the HIV group were discarded due to movement artefacts. Genotyping revealed that 19 participants did not have a e4 allelic variant, 21 were heterozygous for e4, and 3 were homozygous for e4. Because of the small number of homozygous participants in the study (n  3), the initial comparisons of neuropsychological tests and DTI were made between the homozygous and heterozygous together (e4?) and those with no ApoE 4 allele (e4-). The HIV? participants were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Using an Exact statistic, the probability of not being in HWE was 0.58.\nThe demographic variables of gender distribution, age, and education level, as well as CD4 count, are detailed in Table 1. None of these variables were significantly different between the two groups.\nRegarding neuropsychological test performance between the e4? and e4groups, only the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall were significantly different, with the e4 carriers performing poorly on these tests (p  0.05) as indicated in Table 2. Only the HVLT delayed verbal recall result remained significant after Bonferroni correction (p  0.05).\nParticipants that were homozygous for ApoE e4 were separated from those who were heterozygous for ApoE e4, thus forming three groups. Kruskal-Wallis tests of HVLT immediate verbal recall (p  0.021) and delayed verbal recall (p  0.002) were both significant, suggesting that there is a dose-dependent relationship between ApoE status and verbal recall (see Table 3).",

No significant differences in MD were found when comparing the HIV-positive e4? group to the HIV-positive e4group (Table 4).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The main findings of this study of young adults with HIV were that e4 genotype was associated with poorer performance than non-carriers of the genotype, on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and with decreased FA in the corpus callosum. Although only a small number of individuals were homozygous, they had a significantly poorer performance on the HVLT and a lower FA in the corpus callosum when compared with those individuals who were heterozygous, indicating that the number of e4 alleles is related to a negative impact on verbal memory and white matter integrity of the corpus callosum.\nThe frequency of the e4 allele is high in this sample and comparable to a previous study of e4 genotype in a sample of 300 newborn isiXhosa babies (0.302) conducted in Cape Town 25.\nAlthough a number of neuropsychological domains were tested, only immediate and delayed verbal recall performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test was significantly impaired in the group with at least one e4 allele. Standard clinical learning and recall indexes from the HVLT-R have been shown to be among the most sensitive indicators of neuropsychological impairment in persons with HIV-1 infection 26.\nDiffuse damage to cerebral white matter is one of the most frequent neuropathological features of HIV-1 infection 27, and decreased FA in corpus callosum is apparent on DTI 28. Our study suggests that HIV-infected individuals who are homozygous e4 carriers have more significant injury to the white matter of the body of the corpus callosum when compared to HIV-infected individuals with no e4 allelle. This is consistent with previous work in both non-HIV 19 and HIV populations and may reflect a diminished capacity for neuronal repair in e4 carriers. For example, the e4 allele has been found to promote HIV infection by facilitating a greater number of fusion events 10. The e4 allelle showed no protection effects from HIV Tat-induced neurotoxicity when compared with e3 29. It furthermore has to be noted that the observed dosedependence of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test was not found for the FA values, with the heterozygous e 4 having the same FA values as the non-carriers. It may be that the HVLT-R is a more sensitive indicator of HIV-related central nervous system damage in those individuals who are heterozygous e 4. However, when taken together, all e4? carriers had lower FA values than non-carriers. These findings are in keeping with a previous study in which homozygosity but not heterozygosity for the e4 allele was strongly associated with an accelerated rate of disease progression in a HIV-positive cohort 10.\nThis study found a significant difference in FA values between the e4? and e4participants in the frontal and parietal regions of the body of the corpus callosum. These data on HIV are reminiscent of AD literature which found increased radial diffusivity of the anterior corpus callosum in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and increased axial diffusivity of the posterior regions of the corpus callosum in mild AD 30. A study examining both vascular and Alzheimers dementia found that corpus callosum atrophy occurred primarily in the anterior and posterior portions 31. Poorer performance of e4? carriers on the HVLT-R in this study may be related to the lower FA in the frontal regions of the corpus callosum. A study in older adults showed a correlation with declining memory performance and DTI-measured fractional anisotropy in the anterior corpus callosum 32. An implication of this finding is that interhemispheric communication between the frontal cortices could be susceptible to ApoE genotype in HIV.\nOther studies examining ApoE have shown reduced FA in cognitively normal women with both a family history of dementia and at least one e4 allele in the splenium of the corpus callosum 33. Another study showed a decline in FA in the posterior corpus callosum of e4 carriers compared to non-carriers 18. The e4 allelic variant has previously been associated with accelerated age-related volume loss of the prefrontal callosal tracts 34. Thus, the damage to white matter which occurs during HIV infection may be in part genetically determined by the presence or absence of the gene encoding the e4 variant. Further work is needed on the mechanism whereby e4 leads to change in HIV.\nOur study is a cross-sectional one and so is unable to address the question of whether white matter changes noted in participants with e4 represent an early marker of subsequent cognitive decline. Further longitudinal research is needed to determine the influence of e4 on progression of disease and on response to ARVs. Although rigorous attempts were made to exclude central nervous system pathology in our sample, it is possible that it may have been missed. The group of the homozygous patients contained only 3 subjects. Even with adequately using nonparametric tests for the statistics, any interpretation of such results should only be very tentative. Despite these limitations, this is the first study of which we are aware which has shown changes in white matter associated with ApoE in HIV? participants. Identification of an early reliable correlate of risk for subsequent cognitive dysfunction, such as e4, may allow for earlier treatment with HAART and delay the course of HIV disease. Thus, the damage to white matter which occurs during HIV infection may be in part genetically determined by the presence or absence of the gene encoding the e4 variant. Further work is needed on the mechanism whereby e4 leads to change in HIV. In the interim, these findings point to the importance of e4 in predicting verbal memory and DTI findings in HIV.",

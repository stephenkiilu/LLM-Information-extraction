    "abstract": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is considered the most important vascular contributor to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia. There is increasing awareness that SVD exerts its clinical effects by disrupting white matter connections, predominantly disrupting connections between rich club nodes, a set of highly connected and interconnected regions. Here we examined the progression of disturbances in rich club organization in older adults with SVD and their associations with conventional SVD markers and cognitive decline. We additionally investigated associations of baseline network measures with dementia. In 270 participants of the RUN DMC study, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cognitive assessments longitudinally. Rich club organization was examined in structural networks derived from DTI followed by deterministic tractography. Global efficiency (p0.05) and strength of rich club connections (p0.001) declined during follow-up. Decline in strength of peripheral connections was associated with a decline in overall cognition (β0.164; p0.01), psychomotor speed (β0.151; p0.05) and executive function (β0.117; p0.05). Baseline network measures were reduced in participants with dementia, and the association between WMH and dementia was causally mediated by global efficiency (p  0.037) and peripheral connection strength (p  0.040). SVD-related disturbances in rich club organization progressed over time, predominantly in participants with severe SVD. In this study, we found no specific role of rich club connectivity disruption in causing cognitive decline or dementia. The effect of WMH on dementia was mediated by global network efficiency and the strength of peripheral connections, suggesting an important role for network disruption in causing cognitive decline and dementia in older adults with SVD.",

      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is considered the most important vascular contributor to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia (Banerjee et al., 2016;Gorelick et al., 2011;Prins and Scheltens, 2015), but exactly how SVD results in cognitive decline or dementia is hitherto incompletely understood (Patel and Markus, 2011;Wardlaw et al., 2013). There is increasing awareness that SVD exerts its clinical effects by disrupting white matter connections (Lawrence et al., 2014;OSullivan et al., 2005OSullivan et al., , 2001;;Tuladhar et al., 2016a).\nSeveral cross-sectional studies in patients with SVD have shown that reduced structural network integrity, reflected by decreased global efficiency, was related to increased cognitive impairment (Lawrence et al., 2014;Reijmer et al., 2015;Tuladhar et al., 2015Tuladhar et al., , 2016a) ) and to an increased risk of future dementia (Tuladhar et al., https:doi.org10.1016j.nicl.2019.102048 2016b). Reduced connectivity was predominantly observed for connections between so-called rich club nodes (Tuladhar et al., 2017) nodes that are both highly connected to the network and highly interconnected with each other (van den Heuvel et al., 2012;van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011). Moreover, rich club connectivity strength mediated the association of WMH with processing speed and executive functioning, such that higher rich club connectivity strength was associated with better cognitive performance (Tuladhar et al., 2017). However, how SVD-related disturbances in rich club organization progress over time and how this relates to subsequent cognitive decline is unknown.\nWe hypothesize that disturbances in the rich organization progress over time in parallel with disease progression and that this is associated with cognitive decline and dementia. We therefore longitudinally examined the progression of disturbances in rich club organization in 270 participants with SVD and their associations with conventional SVD markers and cognitive decline. We additionally investigated associations of baseline network measures with dementia.",

The detailed study protocol has been published previously (van Norden et al., 2011). In the present study, we only used data available from the first (2011) and second (2015) follow-up assessments and excluded data from the baseline ( 2006) assessment due to slight changes in scanner protocol between 2006 and 2011. In the rest of this article, we will refer to the 2011 assessment as baseline and to the 2015 assessment as follow-up. Of the 503 participants (during the 2006 examination), 329 participants were available for baseline (2011) analyses. In addition, 281 participants underwent repeated neuroimaging assessments (van Leijsen et al., 2017), 11 of whom were excluded because of neuroimaging artefacts, yielding 270 participants for the longitudinal analyses.",

      "text": "Cognitive performance was measured using an extensive neuropsychological test battery during all waves of data collection, as has been described previously (van Uden et al., 2015a). Raw scores of all time-points were transformed into z-scores based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the baseline study population. We calculated Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off (SAT) scores where appropriate. Cognitive decline over time was calculated for each participant individually, by subtracting baseline scores from the follow-up scores.\nWe calculated a compound score for global cognitive function (cognitive index) as well as for three cognitive domains: memory, psychomotor speed and executive function. For the cognitive index, we calculated the mean of the z-scores of all tests from the neuropsychological test battery. To measure memory, we used the immediate and delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (Van der Elst et al., 2005) and the Rey Complex Figure Task (RCFT) (Caffarra et al., 2002), as well as Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off (SAT) scores of the 2-and 3-letter subtasks of the Paper-Pencil Memory Scanning Task (PPMST) (Van Der Elst et al., 2007). Psychomotor speed was calculated as the mean of the z-scores of the 1-letter subtask of the PPMST, the reading and color naming tasks of an adapted version of the Stroop Test (Van der Elst et al., 2006c) and the Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST) (van der Elst et al., 2006a). For executive function, we calculated the interference score of the Stroop Test by dividing SAT-scores of the color-word task by the mean SAT-scores of the reading and color naming tasks of the Stroop Test (Houx et al., 1993), the verbal fluency task ( Van der Elst et al., 2006b) and SAT-scores of the Verbal Series Attention Test (VSAT) (Mahurin and Cooke, 1996). To account for possible material-specific practice effects, parallel versions of the RAVLT, RCFT and verbal fluency test were used for the follow-up assessment.",

Linear and non-linear transformations were finally combined to register the AAL template to each participants diffusion space.\nTwo regions were considered connected if the endpoints of a tractography streamline were located within the pair of brain regions. Connection strengths were estimated based on a modified method of Hagmann and colleagues (Hagmann et al., 2007;Lawrence et al., 2014) and calculated as the sum of the inverse of the streamlines length, including a scaling factor to correct for the number of seeds per squared millimeter. Strengths were calculated for each connection from the number of streamlines, with adjustments to correct for distance traveled and the seeding scheme. For each streamline, the inverse length was calculated and summed. This adjustment is needed to correct for linear bias towards the longer fiber by the tractography technique (Hagmann et al., 2007). Weighted edges were thresholded at 1, to reduce noise-related false-positive connections. This resulted in individual weighted connectivity matrices.",

In addition, we assessed whether the decline in structural network organization was affected by the progression of conventional SVD markers. We therefore performed linear regression analyses using WMH progression, incident lacunes and microbleeds and difference (Δ) scores of network measures, with adjustments for age and sex.\nAdditionally, we aimed to relate the decline in network organization to cognitive decline. Therefore, we performed linear regression analyses, separately for decline in cognitive index, memory, psychomotor speed and executive function, adjusted for age, sex and education.\nFinally, to examine whether baseline alterations in network organization are associated with dementia status at follow-up, we analyzed differences in network measures for participants with and without dementia using one-way ANOVA, adjusted for age, sex and education. To assess whether these network alterations mediated the association between conventional SVD markers with dementia, we additionally performed mediation analyses using lavaan version 0.5-23.1097 in R (Rosseel, 2012).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this longitudinal study, we investigated the progression of structural network connectivity and rich club organization over time in participants with SVD. SVD-related disturbances in rich club organization, specifically the strength of rich club connections, progressed significantly over 3.4 years. Declines in global network efficiency and peripheral, but not rich club or feeder, connection strength were associated with cognitive decline and dementia. The effect of WMH on dementia was causally mediated by global network efficiency and the strength of peripheral connections, suggesting an important role for global network, rather than rich club disruption in causing cognitive decline and dementia in elderly with SVD.\nOur study provides evidence that SVD-related disturbances in structural networks progress over time, which in turn is related to cognitive decline. Previous cross-sectional studies have shown reductions in network global efficiency in participants with SVD that mediated the relationship between conventional MRI markers of SVD and cognitive impairment or dementia (Lawrence et al., 2014;Reijmer et al., 2015;Tuladhar et al., 2015Tuladhar et al., , 2016aTuladhar et al., , 2016b)). In particular, reduced connectivity was predominantly observed for rich club connections, mediating the association of WMH with processing speed and executive functioning (Tuladhar et al., 2017). However, differentiating causality from association is impossible in cross-sectional studies. Two previous longitudinal studies have reported associations between declines in global efficiency and cognitive performance in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Reijmer et al., 2016) and in patients with severe symptomatic SVD (Lawrence et al., 2018). However, to our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have addressed the progression of disturbances in rich club organization over time in patients with SVD and its relation to subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. Our longitudinal findings support the hypothesis that conventional MRI markers of SVD (such as WMH, lacunes and microbleeds) cause cognitive decline and dementia via disruption of structural brain networks.\nSeveral mechanisms can be hypothesized that may explain the decline of rich club connection strength over time. First, the location of incident SVD might correspond to the location of disrupted connections (i.e. WMH progression or incident lacunes or microbleeds might target specific connections and thereby disrupt white matter connections). However, we showed that, on top of baseline SVD, the progression of conventional SVD markers was not significantly associated with the strength of rich club, feeder or peripheral connections (Table 2). We therefore consider this hypothesis as less likely. An alternative Table 2 Associations between SVD markers and rich club organization. explanation might be the high metabolic demand of especially the rich club nodes and connections. It has been argued that especially the rich club nodes have a high rate of metabolic activity and that the long fibers connecting the rich club nodes require higher levels of energy consumption (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009;Crossley et al., 2014). As damage in SVD is presumably caused by ischemia, the progression of small vessel damage might preferentially affect the highly metabolic rich club connections.\nDisturbances in rich club organization were predominantly observed in participants with severe baseline WMH, both in rich club connections and in feeder as well as peripheral connections. These findings suggest an important role for global network function in older adults with SVD, rather than rich club disruption specifically, further supporting the notion that SVD should be considered a global rather than a focal disease (Ter Telgte et al., 2018).\nInterestingly, we did not observe any associations between decline in rich club connection strength and decline in cognitive performance. While rich club connection strength was significantly associated with cognitive performance in cross-sectional analyses, cognitive decline over time was only associated with decline in peripheral connection strength, rather than with a decline in rich club or feeder connection strength. Although we are not aware of any studies investigating the preferential role of specific connections for cognitive function in elderly with SVD longitudinally, these results are in contrast to what we would expect based on findings from several cross-sectional studies reporting an important role for rich club connections in cognitive processes, specifically for psychomotor speed and executive function (Baggio et al., 2015;Tuladhar et al., 2017). There may be several explanations for not finding this association. First, it might be that the cognitive domains measured in our study reflect localized rather than global cognitive functions, for which proper network function and integration is required. However, since we observed associations between rich club connection strength and psychomotor speed and executive functionknown to rely on the integration of distributed brain areasrather than with memory performance in cross-sectional analyses, we consider this hypothesis less likely. Second, the selection of rich club nodes was based on node degree in healthy controls; although this selection has been validated in several studies (Collin et al., 2014;van den Heuvel et al., 2013) and these nodes were among the highest ranked nodes in our study population (data not shown), the rich club organization in our study population was already disrupted at baseline due to their SVD (Tuladhar et al., 2017). Possibly, the contribution of decline in rich club connection strength to cognitive decline, in addition to the baseline disruption of rich club connections, is limited relative to peripheral connections. Third, it might be that initial disruptions of the rich club connections are followed by secondary disruptions of the feeder or peripheral connections and that impairments in peripheral connections only lead to clinical overt symptoms after a certain threshold of structural network disruption is reached (Crossley et al., 2014). Finally, it might be that cortical structures have an important role in causing cognitive decline and dementia. Gray matter atrophy in frontal brain areas, for example, might explain executive dysfunction in participants with SVD (Gunning-Dixon and Raz, 2000). This hypothesis was supported by previous studies reporting that lower cortical thickness in frontotemporal regions was related to cognitive deficits independent of WMH (Du et al., 2005;Tuladhar et al., 2015).\nOur finding that baseline measures of global efficiency and peripheral connections are impaired in participants who developed dementia is clinically relevant, because it suggests that network parameters might be useful as markers to predict cognitive decline and the risk of progression to dementia. Additionally, the finding that the effect of WMH on dementia is causally mediated by global network efficiency and the strength of peripheral connections provides additional insights into the underlying mechanisms of cognitive symptoms attributable to SVD. Altogether, these findings suggest that the structural network acts as a mediator between conventional SVD markers and cognitive outcome and may allow identification of individuals at high risk of developing dementia.\nMajor strengths of the study were the large cohort of individuals covering a wide range of the SVD spectrum, the detailed phenotyping of the patients, including the diagnosis of dementia according to a standardized approach in all patients and the availability of longitudinal neuroimaging data obtained from the same scanner without upgrade or change over the full data collection period. However, several methodological issues should also be considered. First, the identification of structural networks was based on DTI acquired at 1.5 Tesla with relatively few diffusion directions and deterministic streamlining using tensor reconstruction models, limiting the identification of long-distance fibers and the reconstruction of white matter tracts in a complex white matter architecture due to noise and partial volume effects (Zalesky and Fornito, 2009). Although high-resolution imaging and more advanced tractography methods are required to provide more detailed information about the white matter architecture, the consistency of our findings on impaired global efficiency in SVD and its relation with cognitive performance with other studies (Lawrence et al., 2014;Reijmer et al., 2015;Tuladhar et al., 2016a) indicate that our network analyses in participants with SVD are reliable. Second, it might as well be that our observed changes in rich club organization and cognitive performance over time are not solely attributable to SVD, but also to the effects of normal aging or to other pathologies such as neurodegeneration or Alzheimers disease, or interaction with these pathologies. However, the associations between conventional SVD markers with measures of rich club organization and the causal mediations of the associations between WMH and dementia via structural network properties indicate that the disruption of structural networks is important in explaining cognitive decline in elderly with SVD.",

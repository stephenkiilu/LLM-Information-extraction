    "abstract": "Objective: Functional alterations of the visual attention networks in a setting of impaired visual information processing have a role in the genesis of visual hallucinations (VH) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This multimodal MRI study aims at exploring structural and functional basis of VH. Methods: 23 DLB patients (10 with and 13 without VH) and 13 healthy controls were studied. They underwent MRI with T1-w sequences to measure cortical thickness, DTI for wholebrain and single tract microstructural properties and rs-fMRI of the default mode, dorsal and ventral attention, and visual networks. Results: In DLB with VH, whole-brain DTI revealed a lower fractional anisotropy and a greater mean diffusivity in the right frontal and temporo-parietal white matter tracts. Tracts dissection showed lower fractional anisotropy in the right inferior and superior (ventral part) longitudinal fasciculi (ILF and SLF) (p  .05, corrected), and greater mean diffusivity (p  .05). The extent of white matter microstructural alterations involving the right ILF and SLF correlated with the severity of VH (r ¼ .55, p  .01; r ¼ .42, p  .05, respectively), and with performance in the visual attention task (r ¼ À.56 and r ¼ À.61; p  .01, respectively). Cortical thickness in the projection areas of the right SLF was significantly reduced (p  .05). Patients with VH also showed an altered functional connectivity in the ventral attention network, connected by the ventral portion of the SLF (p  .05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a combination of microstructural and functional alterations involving the attention networks in the right hemisphere may be important in the genesis of VH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Visual hallucinations (VH) are visual experiences not elicited by external stimuli. They are common in numerous pathological conditions, including: ocular diseases (ffytche  Howard, 1999;ffytche, 2009;Schadlu, et al., 2009); epilepsy (Duarte Mangas, et al., 2017;Panayiotopoulos, 1999;Saha et al., 2016); primary psychiatric disorders with psychosis (Baethge et al., 2005;Bracha et al., 1989;Goodwin et al., 1971); and neurodegenerative diseases (Cagnin et al., 2013;Diederich et al., 2009;Fenelon et al., 2000;Urwyler et al., 2016;Williams et al., 2008).\nAs reviewed by ffytche (ffytche 2008), the literature on VH originally focused on the abnormal functioning of specific brain regions, such as the occipital lobe, and the role of topological hyperfunction (Holroyd et al., 2000;Panayiotopoulos 1999). There is plenty of evidence of VH being associated with transient increases in activity in localized cortical regions, and the specialization of the regions affected decides the content of the VH. Indirect evidence comes from patients experiencing types of VH that relate to their abilities that are still intact, not to those they have lost (ffytche et al., 2004;Hubl et al., 2007). In many brain diseases, VH are characterized mainly by recurrent complex visions (seeing objects, animals and human beings, for instance), rather than simple VH such as seeing dots, lines, flashes, and amorphous shapes (Collerton et al., 2005). A topology-based approach seems unable to explain the complexity of the symptoms adequately, so a functional model has been proposed that emphasizes the altered integration and segregation of information, and the neural activity involved in promoting efficient information processing (Park  Friston, 2013). This hodological view has been applied to neuropsychological theories of VH, according to which they would result from: an abnormal processing of visual information combined with an impaired top-down monitoring of visual attention (Collerton et al., 2005); or from an imbalance between the dorsal and ventral attention networks (Shine et al., 2011;OBrien et al., 2020). In the last two decades, attention and visual perception networks have been elucidated both anatomically and functionally, and the activity and interaction between networks have been investigated (Corbetta  Shulman, 2011;Thiebaut de Schotten, DellAcqua, et al., 2011;Bartolomeo et al., 2012). It has emerged that dorsal and ventral attention networks have different functions, and functional localizations. The dorsal attention network has a bilateral organization, and is involved in representing contralateral spatial information, and in shifting attention and eye movements. The ventral attention network has a right-hemisphere dominance and is involved in vigilance, in re-orienting attention to sensory-driven or behaviorallyrelevant stimuli, and in task resetting (Corbetta  Shulman, 2002;He, Snyder, et al., 2007).\nAs concerns structural connectivity, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) bi-directionally connects the occipital regions to the medial and lateral anterior temporal lobes. It is involved in processing visual emotion and visual memory information (Latini et al., 2017). The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) connects regions of the occipital and ventral frontal lobes. Connections between the visual part of the parietal lobe and the frontal cortex are via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), while those between the occipital and limbic cortex are via the cingulum and the ILF. The SLF and IFOF contain projections of neuronal networks involved in processing visual attention, visual working memory, visual praxis, visuo-vestibular function, and eye movement control (ffytche et al., 2010).\nRecurrent complex VH are a core feature pointing to the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (McKeith et al., 2017). They occur in about 60 of suspected cases of DLB (Aarsland et al., 2001), and are considered a strong predictor of this condition (Tiraboschi et al., 2006). Patients with DLB show occipital hypometabolism, one of the neuroimaging hallmarks of the disease, that has revealed no clear relationship with VH (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014;Firbank et al., 2016;Taylor et al., 2012). DLB is consequently an attractive model for investigating the neural mechanisms behind VH.\nSome studies have focused on white matter connectivity in subjects with DLB and VH, finding changes in the level of diffusivity in temporo-occipital connections, especially in the right hemisphere (Kantarci et al., 2010;Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015). Previous association between long white matter tracts and functional brain networks have been reported (Thiebaut de Schotten, Dell Acqua, et al., 2011;Parlatini et al., 2017), but no multimodal studies to date have assessed the combined interaction of structural and functional changes in cases of DLBrelated VH. Here, we use diffusion tensor imaging tractography to examine the involvement of white matter tracts connecting the visual cortex to regions of the attention networks in patients with DLB with and without VH. We also explore: whether changes in the white matter bundles of subjects who experience VH lead to a reduction in cortical thickness; and whether functional changes in the attention and visual networks are detectable on resting-state functional MRI images (rs-fMRI). Exclusion criteria were: brain MRI evidence of severe cerebrovascular disease; a history of primary psychiatric disorders; and severe ocular diseases with impaired visual acuity. Patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors or levodopa were only eligible for the study if they had been on stable doses for at least three months.",

Then a subjects T1 image was registered to the MNI152 template and the same deformation was applied to individual cortical thickness maps using normalize in the BCB toolkit (Foulon et al., 2018). The normalize function uses affine and diffeomorphic deformations (Avants et al., 2011;Klein et al., 2009) to register T1 images. Target ROIs were chosen among those representing the cortical projections of white matter tracks found different in the comparison between VH and no-VH patients with DLB.

The fMRI images were corrected for motion using MCFLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002), then corrected for slice timing, smoothed with a full half width maximum 1.5 times the largest voxel size, and filtered for low temporal frequencies using a Gaussian-weighted local fit to a straight line. All these steps are also available in Feat as part of the FSL package (Woolrich et al., 2009). The fMRI images were linearly registered to the T1 images, and then to the MNI152 template (2 mm) using affine transformation. Confounding signals were discarded from the fMRI images by regressing out a confounding matrix from the functional data. The confounding matrix included the estimated motion parameters obtained from the previously-performed motion correction, the first eigenvariate of the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, and their first derivative. Eigenvariates can be extracted using fslmeants combined with the -eig option. White matter and cerebrospinal fluid eigenvariates were extracted using masks based on the T1-derived three-class segmentation thresholded to a probability of .9, registered to the rs-fMRI images, and binarized. The first derivative of the motion parameters, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal was then calculated by linear convolution between their time course and a -1 0 1. The time courses were extracted from a previouslyobtained set of 66 ROI defining the default mode network (DMN), ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and visual network (VIS) (Gordon et al., 2016).",

The alpha level was set at .05. The DTI-TBSS voxelwise analyses were conducted using the randomize FSL tool for non-parametric statistics. Statistical tests were run with a mean FA skeleton threshold of 5000 permutations, and a significance level at p-value corrected for a multiple-comparison family-wise error .05.

Cortical atrophy was tested with a t-test comparing the groups with DLB (p  .05).\nTo test the relationship between DTI changes and cortical thickness, 2 successive Bayesian linear regressions were used to test the prediction of each measure. For instance, we tested whether the cortical thickness of the projection of the right SLF3 (i.e., the dependent variable) could be predicted using FA values in the left and right SLF3 and ILF (i.e., the independent variable). Reversely we tested whether the FA values of the right SLF3 could be predicted using the cortical thickness of the projections of the left and right SLF3 and ILF. Analyses were performed using JASP (https:jasp-stats.org).\nAs in the rs-fMRI data analysis, a correlation matrix was built, calculating the correlation of the time course of each ROI with that of every other ROI, which gave rise to a 66 Â 66 correlation matrix for each subject. A separate ANOVA was run to compare the DLB groups, and statistical significance was set at p  .05.",

First, whole-brain tractography analysis showed damage to white matter tracts in patients with VH, especially in the right FA was decreased in the right ILF and SLF3, and MD was increased in the right ILF, SLF3, IFOF, and left UNC. Second, cortical thickness in regions connected through the right SLF3 was reduced in patients with VH. Third, changes in anisotropic variables in the right SLF3 and ILF correlated significantly with severity of VH and visual attention impairment. Finally, resting-state fMRI showed a reduced within-network signal synchronization in regions of the DMN, and (to a lesser extent) of the DAN, and an increased synchronization in regions of the VAN in patients with VH.\nOverall, these findings strongly support the importance of right-hemisphere attention networks in the generation of VH in patients with DLB.",

    "White matter bundle alterations in visual hallucinations": {
      "text": "Previous structural connectivity studies in DLB found changes in the long associative white matter bundles in patients with VH. Kantarci and collaborators found increased MD in the right ILF of patients with VH (Kantarci et al., 2010). Delli Pizzi et al. found a reduced FA in the right ILF of patients with DLB who experienced VH, and an increased MD in the thalamic regions projecting towards the bilateral prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortex, right amygdala, and left cortex.\nMD in the right thalamic sub-region projecting towards the parieto-occipital cortex also correlated with the severity of VH (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015;Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Thomas, et al., 2015).\nOur study supports previous findings that right ILF is a target of microstructural changes in patients with DLB and VH.\nThe ILF connects the occipital cortex to the inferiortemporal cortex. It is part of the ventral visual stream essential for object recognition (Milner 1995;Ungerleider  Haxby, 1994), face recognition (Grossi et al., 2014), and related Microstructural changes in associative white matter tracts may impair bottom-up visual processing, and comparison with top-down information stored in the inferotemporal cortex. This effect may contribute to the generation of VH, in which case the experience of VH by patients with DLB would reflect a mismatch between incoming visual information and top-down priors. Loss of top-down feedback may cause hypoactivation of the occipital visual regions, which are hypometabolic in DLB, although this occipital hypometabolism per se does not seem to explain the occurrence of VH (Pezzoli et al., 2017).\nThe ILFs anatomy might be the cause of the absence of relation between the ILF projection cortical thickness and FA.\nThe ILF is composed of direct and indirect u-shaped fibres (Catani et al., 2003). The ILF measures reported in the manuscript include solely direct connections between the occipital and the anterior temporal lobes, which, putatively, may have maintained their functioning via the indirect u-shaped route. This rerouting of information via the u-shaped fibres may also cause VH as visual areas skipped initially by the direct route became a relay for the visual information. In summary, cortico-cortical disconnection of the occipital cortex from regions of the temporal lobe though ILF, may play a role in the genesis of the VH and contribute to the deficit of visual attention. However, occipital cortical disconnection from subcortical regions of the midbrain should also be considered for the genesis of VH. In fact, presence of RBD has been found associated with a greater frequency of VH in PD (Gallagher et al., 2011) and DLB (Cagnin et al., 2013) as it was found in the present study.\nOur study shows another neural correlate of VH in DLB, namely damage to the right SLF3, associated with microstructural alterations (FA, MD), and abnormal correlation with functional connectivity on fMRI. The SLF is a white fiber bundle connecting the frontal and parietal lobes (Thiebaut de Schotten M, DH Ffytche, et al., 2011). It has three main tractsthe dorsal (SLF1), middle (SLF2) and ventral (SLF3) components -respectively connecting the DAN cortical areas, the VAN to the DAN networks, and the VAN cortical areas (Thiebaut de Schotten, DellAcqua, et al., 2011). SLF1 connects inferior parietal (IPS) to prefrontal (FEF) regions of the dorsal attention network (DAN) (Corbetta  Shulman, 2002;He, Snyder, et al., 2007). SLF2 connects the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) to the FEF regions. SLF3 connects the TPJ to the anterior insula and inferior frontal cortex, the primary nodes of the VAN (Parlatini et al., 2017). There are SLF1 and SLF2 pathways in both hemispheres, and their hemispheric lateralization correlates with visuospatial processing biases ordinarily present in healthy individuals, whereas the main volume of SLF3 is in the right hemisphere (Thiebaut de Schotten, Dell Acqua, et al., 2011). Functionally, the DAN controls eye movements and spatial attention, while the VAN is activated during vigilance and sustained attention tasks. Target detection and reorienting of attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli also recruit the VAN, mainly in the right hemisphere (He BJ, AZ Snyder, et al. 2007).\nRecently Zarkali et al. highlighted the importance of loss of fronto-occipital connectivity in the development of hallucinations in a group of PD hallucinators, specifically those connecting frontal and occipital lobes (Zarkali et al., 2020).\nOur findings indicate that VH in patients with DLB are associated with an abnormal functioning of the VAN in the right hemisphere. The detection of microstructural white matter abnormalities in SLF3, the correlation of SLF3 anisotropic variables with severity of VH and visual attention impairment, the reduced cortical thickness of the SLF3 projecting regions, and the abnormal synchronization within VAN may reflect two primary information processing deficits: Corbetta, 2007;Shulman GL et al., 2007). A low state of alertness associated with a weaker firing of the locus coeruleus and lower TPJ activity may reduce the cortical signal-to-noise ratio, leading to abnormal perception, misperceptions, and hallucinations. This hypothesis can be tested by measuring autonomic activity and pupillary responses during visual tasks. 2. Damage to the right SLF3VAN impairs our ability to shift attention and focus of processing between objects in our visual field. Remaining focused on a particular location can engender hallucinationsein fact, VH can be induced in healthy individuals if they fixate on flickering stimuli (Pearson et al., 2016). This second hypothesis can also be tested by demonstrating that DLB patients with and without hallucinations differ in their ability to use eye movements to explore visual scenes.\nThe lateralization on the right hemisphere of microstructural white matter changes and cortical thickness could therefore better explained by a de-arrangement of functional circuits (VAN) and neurochemical pathways (i.e., locus coeruleus) with a main right lateralization than by asymmetric DLB-related neuropathological changes affecting the right side.",

    "Derangement of functional attentional networks": {
      "text": "We found a high correlation of fMRI connectivity in the right VAN of VH patients, notwithstanding a decrease of microstructure and volume of the right SLF3.\nThe healthy brain shows a positive correlation between the strengths of its structural and functional connectivity (Straathof, Sinke, Dijkhuizen,  Otte, 2019), although this correlation at the individual level is weak (Misic et al., 2015). Acute damage (e.g., stroke) alters functional and structural connectivity, and the positive correlation between them (Griffis et al., 2019(Griffis et al., , 2020)). Intriguingly, functional connections become weaker in the event of anatomical damage, but synaptic re-weighting (especially of indirectlyconnected regions) may lead to abnormally high correlations (Griffis et al., 2019;Siegel et al., 2016). This is also seen in experimental models of traumatic brain injury (Harris et al., 2016), and in early stages of multiple sclerosis (Filippi  Rocca, 2013;Hawellek et al., 2011). In the case of DLB, in which alpha-synuclein slowly accumulates in cortical circuitries and spreads via trans-synaptic routes, a similar mechanism may be involved when early microstructural changes in the right SLF3 is associated with increases in connectivity in the right VAN on fMRI.\nWe found alterations across multiple networks (DAN, DMN, VAN), as seen in previous studies (Kenny et al., 2012;Kobelevaet al., 2017;Onofrj et al., 2019). Changes found in the functional correlations between the networks mainly concerned the visual network. These results suggest that individuals with VH have an impairment of the main networks involved in processing visual environmental information and are consistent with the results of previous studies of fMRI data in which patient with DLB pathology have an alteration on coupling between the DAN and the VAN, with a consequently disconnection between the two networks during the presentation of external stimuli.\nA few theoretical models have been proposed to explain the cognitive derangement responsible for the genesis of recurrent complex VH typical of DLB and Parkinsons disease. One is the perceptive and attention deficit model proposed by Collerton et al. (Collerton et al., 2005), in which a combination of visual perception impairment and attention deficit, possibly caused by network misalignment in the frontal and parieto-occipital areas, is needed to promote VH. Visual attention deficits can be caused by an altered top-down control (from the frontal cortex to the visual association cortex), while impaired visual perception and spatial functions may be due to difficulties with elaborating visual stimuli in the associative visual regions (bottom-up control) (Cagnin et al., 2013).\nAnother theoretical model of VH (Shine et al., 2011) emphasizes the importance of an imbalance between DAN and VAN. The former includes cortical regions in the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye fields of each hemisphere, while the latter contains the TPJ, the ventral frontal cortex and the anterior insula (Corbetta, Patel,  Shulman, 2008). DAN is mainly activated by cue-target stimuli, and it is important in the voluntary orienting of attention (top-down control). VAN is activated by invalid stimuli and is involved in detecting unexpected but behaviorally relevant events (bottom-up control).\nIn the light of our findings, it could be that patients with complex VH have an impaired involuntary environmentmonitoring attention system. This would entail the loss of a regulatory process that, associated with a less efficient visuoperceptive network for information processing, would lead to misperceptions, and generate VH. Further studies are needed to clarify the specific contributions of neurotransmitter alterations to synaptic dysfunction and resting-state network alterations, and ultimately to the promotion of VH.\nThis study has some limitations that we need to acknowledge. The deterministic approach to reconstruct DTI tracts and the manual ROI drawing for fiber bundles dissection some known limitations described previously in literature (Chung et al., 2011;Ressel et al., 2018): operator-dependency, difficulties resolving curving, crossing or kissing tracts. Lacking rs-fMRI data for a healthy control group restricts our interpretation of network impairment. We established a probable diagnosis of DLB in our sample based on clinical criteria alone; no autoptic confirmation was available (this diagnosis was obtained at specialized centers, however, and confirmed at follow-up). The size of our sample of patients with DLB is also relatively small. Finally, the NPI (item 2) used to assess the presence and severity of VH cannot further characterize these phenomena. More complex VH assessments will be needed in future work.\nOur multimodal neuroimaging study nonetheless revealed altered neuro-anatomical and functional connections in patients with DLB who experienced VH. A disrupted interplay between attentional networks and DMN, sustained by white matter long tracts -mainly in the right hemisphere, such as SLF3 -has a crucial role in the genesis of VH. No part of the study procedures was pre-registered prior to the research being conducted. We report in this paper how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all inclusion exclusion criteria, whether inclusionexclusion criteria were established prior to data analysis, all manipulations, and all measures in the study, in the Methods section. The conditions of the ethics approval for the neuroimaging data from Azienda Ospedaliera-University of Padua do not permit public archiving of those individual anonymised MRI data. Readers seeking information about those data should contact the author Dr Giovanni Zorzi at the Department of Neuroscience-Padova Neuroscience Center University of Padua at giovanni.zorzi.88 gmail.com. Specifically, requestors must meet the following conditions to obtain the data: completion of a formal data sharing agreement. The analyses in the study using SPSS, FSL and JASP did not involve any custom analysis scripts.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is suggested to cause stroke and dementia in older adults. Retinal structural thicknesses revealed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) are associated with structural changes in the brain. We aimed to explore the association between the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and cerebral microstructural changes in participants with white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Methods: Seventy-four participants (37 controls, healthy control (HC), and 37 older adults with WMH) underwent retinal and brain imaging using OCT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) respectively. Peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed by the OCT. Gray matter volume (GMV) was assessed from a T1-weighted MRI. White matter integrity was assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) while WMH severity was assessed with the Fazekas scale. All participants underwent a neuropsychological examination (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE). Results: Older adults with WMH showed thinner peripapillary RNFL (p  0.004) thickness when compared with the control group after adjusting for age, hypertension and gender. In our older adults with WMH, RNFL thickness correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (Rho  -0.331, p  0.001). In older adults with WMH, RNFL was significantly associated with MMSE scores (Rho  0.422, p  0.001) and Fazekas scores (Rho  -0.381, p  0.022) respectively. Conclusions: We suggest neurodegeneration of peripapillary RNFL in older adults with WMH was associated with cerebral microstructural volume, impaired cerebral axonal damage, and cognitive performances. OCT metrics may provide evidence of neurodegeneration that may underpin WMH and cerebral microstructural changes in the brain. Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered online at the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (registration number: ChiCTR-ROC-17011819).",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is a major cause of stroke and dementia in the aging population 1,2, however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear and treatments are limited. Recent reports 1,3 suggested that WMH is associated with cerebral vascular impairment. WMH is a feature of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and is common in older adults. WMH can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as hyperintense on T2-weighted scans.\nThe retina and the brain share many features such as embryologic origin, precise neuronal cell layers, blood barriers, and microvasculature 4. As opposed to the brain, the retina is directly visible using standard ophthalmology tools. Since the retina is visible and shares a similar neurobiology with the brain, it can be used to develop a pointof-care test that can detect disease-related biomarkers at an early stage. It has been reported that subtle alterations in the retina may reflect the pathological changes of the brain during a disease cascade 5. The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) has been reported to be a useful structural biomarker for neurodegeneration in the eye 6. Optical imaging modalities such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) provide a non-invasive in vivo visualization and quantification of the RNFL thickness.\nPrevious reports have shown significant macula thinning in patients with WMH 7, dementia 8, and mild cognitive impairment when compared with healthy controls. A previous report with a large sample size showed that thinning of the RNFL is associated with a higher risk of increasing dementia and proposed that alterations in the RNFL may be a structural biomarker for dementia 9101112. Ong et al. 13 recruited elderly adults without dementia and found an association between the changes in the RNFL thickness and changes in the mediotemporal lobe volumes. Cerebral imaging modalities such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been reported to be a good imaging technique for the evaluation of white matter integrity of the brain 14,15 it is also sensitive to global age-related changes that occur in the brain and may be useful in the retinal changes as well.\nHere, we investigated the associations between retinal thickness measured using OCT and microstructural volume measures from brain MRI and DTI measurements of white matter microstructural integrity in older adults with WMH.",

Assessments included clinical, lifestyle, blood tests, brain and retinal imaging. The rationale for the study along with the protocol and design of this study have been well documented in our previous study 16.\nOlder adults (50 years old) who attended our hospital but did not show any neurologic disorder on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were enrolled in our study as controls. Individuals were excluded from the study if they had the following: toxic disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS), history of substance abuse, and medical ailment involving the use of concomitant corticosteroid or immunosuppressant therapy. Lifestyle and clinical information were recorded for all controls.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Childrens Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Ethics Approval No. 10 2017, Clinical Science Review) and all participants gave written informed consent.

      "text": "Diffusion imaging was used to assess white matter integrity in our study participants. Image analysis is carried out by the process of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in FSL software. Data were inspected for movement artifacts using FSL-MCFLIRT (https:fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslfslwiki MCFLIRT) (1rotation and 1 mm translation) and then corrected for eddy current-induced distortions. FSL was used to perform the brain extraction and calculation of diffusion parameter maps. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps for each participant were registered into a standard brain template (FMRIB58 FA, part of the FSL suite) using the nonlinear spatial transformation tool FNIRT. A mean FA image was then compiled by averaging aligned FA maps from each participant. To generate a mean FA skeleton representing the centers of all tracts common to the group, the map threshold was then set for voxels showing FA values 0.2. Aligned FA maps for each participant were projected onto the standard skeletonized FA image (FMRIB58 FAskeleton, packaged in FSL) by searching the area around the skeleton in the direction perpendicular to each tract, finding the highest local FA value, and assigning this value to the skeleton 18.\nVBM and TBSS are both whole-brain comparisons. We locate gray matter differential brain regions based on the anatomical automatic labeling 3 (AAL3) brain template 19. We position white matter fiber bundles based on the international consortium for brain mapping-diffusion tensor imaging (ICBM-DTI-81) white-matter labels atlas (https:cmrm.med.jhmi.edu) 20. We then extracted signals from different brain regions for further analysis. During processing, the average map is produced to register into a standard MNI152 space.\nParticipants also underwent fundus and optic disc imaging using fundus photography. Abnormalities of the optic disc and macular were defined as present if any of the following were detected: retinal andor optic nerve head hemorrhage, soft and hard exudates, retinal andor optic disc edema, papilledema and optic disc atrophy. If a participant presented with any of these abnormalities, the participant was excluded from our study.",

In our study, the mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was automatically generated by the optical coherence tomography (OCT) tool. The RNFL thickness was acquired using the optic nerve head (ONH) map protocol, with a scanning range covering a diameter of 3.45 mm centered on the optic disc as shown in Fig. 2. OCT images with ophthalmic disorders such as age-macular degeneration, severe cataracts, optic neuritis, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and optic neuritis were excluded. If a participant presented with any of these disorders in one eye, the other eye was used if both eyes had the disorders aforementioned, the participant was excluded from the study.

      "text": "We identified 43 older adults with WMH and 45 older adults without WMH as controls. Participants were excluded because of either poor MRI scans, macular pathologic findings, or poor-quality OCT scans as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Table 1 displays the characteristics of our study participants. Thirty-seven WMH participants (mean age  66.19 years) and 37 controls (mean age  64.91 years) were included in the data analyses. Significant changes (p  0.05) were not seen in sex, age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure), vascular risk factors (including smoking, alcohol, hypercholesterolemia), blood biochemical indexes including hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), homocysteine (Hcy), serum creatinine (Scr), visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Moreover, older adults with WMH had increased Fazekas scores (p  0.001), worse Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p  0.001) and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness (p  0.004) compared to the control group as shown in Table 1.\nTable 2 and Fig. 3 show the comparison of cerebral microstructural volume between the groups. Older adults with WMH showed significantly reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the left frontal inferior orbital gyrus (p  0.014), left superior temporal gyrus (p  0.04), left frontal middle orbital gyrus (p  0.013), left cerebellum (p  0.001), left inferior temporal gyrus (p  0.007) when compared to the control group.\nCompared to the control group, older adults with WMH had lower FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (p  0.027) and splenium of corpus callosum (p  0.001) as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This observational study demonstrates that thinner RNFL thickness in older adults with WMH was associated with reduced GMV and FA parameters. We also showed that thinner RNFL thickness in older adults with WMH correlated with increased Fazekas scores and lower montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores.\nPrevious studies 12,16,24,25 showed WMH participants have thinner RNFL thickness compared to controls and suggested that the thinning of the RNFL may be due to transneuronal retrograde degeneration. Here we showed the peripapillary RNFL thickness was thinner in older adults with WMH when compared to controls. The peripapillary RNFL is located around the optic nerve head and is mainly composed of ganglion cell axons 5,13. Besides, it is suggested that this retinal parameter is sensitive to white matter microstructural changes in the brain 5,26. Here, we suggest that changes in the peripapillary RNFL may reflect the axonal damage (neurodegeneration) occurring in the brain.\nAccumulating studies 262728 have shown that retinal structural changes are associated with white matter microstructural changes, yet how these structural changes are related to other brain parameters is underexplored. We showed that in older adults with WMH, the GMV of the left superior temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus was reduced when compared with the control group. The Wernick area is behind the left superior temporal gyrus and is responsible for language understanding. These structural changes may be the anatomical basis of cognitive function changes in patients with WMH. Besides, we showed that the GMV in the left cerebellum of the WMH group was reduced when compared to the control group. The cerebellum is an important regulatory center of movement, with a large number of incoming and outgoing connections. Also, it plays an important role in maintaining body balance receives information from the vestibular organs, and changes the tension of muscles in different parts of the body through outgoing connections, so that the body maintains a balanced posture during acceleration or rotation under the action of gravity. Importantly, it plays an important role in vision. Thus, any damage to this structure can lead to damage to the sensory system and gait disturbances, as previously reported 29,30. Here we suggest that these GMV differences seen between older adults with WMH and controls may reflect the widespread degeneration.\nWe also showed GMV was lower in the left frontal inferior orbital gyrus and left frontal middle orbital gyrus of older adults with WMH when compared with the control group moreover, an association was shown between the RNFL thickness and the left frontal inferior orbital gyrus and left frontal middle orbital gyrus respectively in older adults with WMH. The left frontal inferior orbital and left frontal middle orbital gyrus are part of the orbitofrontal cortex, which sits above the orbits. The orbitofrontal cortex has extensive connections with sensory areas as well as limbic system structures involved in emotion and memory. A previous report 31 showed that cerebral small vessel disease patients with gait impairments have significantly reduced orbitofrontal cortical thickness. Our current report suggests that changes in the orbitofrontal cortex occur during the subclinical phase of neurodegenerative disease the association between these cerebral structures and the RNFL suggests that changes in these cerebral structures may reflect the changes in the eye echoing the association between the brain and the eye.\nReduced FA occurs in WMH and indicates sub-visible alterations in the axonal integrity, fiber density, or myelin structure 32. Here we found that thinner peripapillary RNFL thickness in older adults with WMH was associated with sub-visible white matter damage (reduced FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and splenium of corpus callosum) in keeping with increased demyelination and axonal loss 33,34. It will be important to assess whether early retinal structural changes can predict WMH progression and white matter damage in the long term.\nWMH is a common characteristic of SVD on brain MRI. Previous studies used the Fazekas score to represent WMH severity and showed retinal structural thicknesses correlated with increased Fazekas score 12,16. Here, worse WMH scores (assessed by visual rating) correlated with thinner peripapillary RNFL thickness in older adults with WMH.\nPivotal methodologies for diagnosis of cognitive functioning are based on neuropsychological assessments such as mini-mental state examination scores (MMSE) 35. In our current study, we found a significant association between the MMSE score and the RNFL which is congruent with previous reports 11,27. An association between the RNFL and MMSE scores suggests that the neurodegeneration associated with the WMH causes neuro-axonal damage resulting in the decline of cognitive functioning.\nAn important aspect of this study was a comprehensive brain imaging protocol that produced key metrics about the brain. We would like to acknowledge some limitations in our study. To begin with, the observational crosssectional design of our study confines us to draw assumptions about the cause and effect longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate more on our current study and validate our hypotheses. As with most diagnostic tests, patient cooperation is an obligation. Head andor eye movement from the participant can diminish the quality of the image and some participants were excluded from the study because of eye movement during the examination as such some images were excluded due to poor imaging which may introduce bias. This is important in clinical studies that are more likely exhibit movement compromising the quality of the data. Before actual scanning, study participants can be trained on a mock scanner to mitigate this issue. Movement can also be accounted for in the analysis phase. There are several pitfalls to TBSS, including the inability to correct misalignment and a lack of sensitivity and specificity. As in most previous studies, differences in white matter were observed in the corpus callosum and other large matter pathways. DTI has problems with kissing and crossing fibers. In neural areas with multiple fiber paths crossing, this model has difficulty modeling them accurately. Consideration should be given to techniques more robust to such intersection such as high angular diffusion magnetic imaging (HARDI) or diffusion spectral imaging (DSI). Another limitation of our study is the lack of evaluation of other layers of the retina structures however, we used the OCT machine to evaluate the peripapillary RNFL. Reports with a segmentation algorithm of the retina are needed to elucidate the association between the macular thickness and cerebral metrics.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD), a more homogeneous subtype of cerebral vascular disease, is considered one of the major causes for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) 1,2 . It has been reported that the proportion of vascular dementia (VaD) caused by SIVD ranges from 36 to 67 in clinical samples 3 . Nonde-Xu ZhouLi Cao Lin Pan Chen Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 2010;30:317-326 318 mented patients with SIVD may also experience cognitive deficits 4,5 . Multiple lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions (WMLs) are particularly disruptive to the subcortical thalamic-basal-prefrontal circuits, which might result in the main cognitive, behavioral and clinical neurological features of SIVD 6,7 .\nNeuroimaging studies of VCI require a clinical correlation in the assessment of patients. Although conventional MRI techniques, such as T 1 -weighted imaging, T 2weighted imaging or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T 2 -weighted imaging, have been widely adopted in previous SIVD studies, the cognitive relevance of these measures is still equivocal 89101112 . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a more recent MRI-based technique, has made it possible to assess white matter integrity in vivo. DTI detects microstructural alterations in white matter by measuring the directionality of molecular diffusion (fractional anisotropy, FA) and the average motion of water molecules (mean diffusivity, MD). Diseases that disrupt the directionality of fiber tracts and white matter integrity reduce FA and increase MD 13 . Thus, DTI may be used to detect disconnection of the circuit that extends beyond the visible borders of leukoaraiosis.\nIn the present study, we assessed whole-brain DTI indices in a group of SIVD patients. Their cognitive status ranged from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to VCI no dementia (VCIND) and VaD. We included detailed, conventional MRI measures as comparisons. T 2 -weighted lesion (T 2 lesion) volumes, lacune number, WML rating scores, hippocampal volumes, whole-brain gray matter (WBGM) volumes and whole-brain white matter (WBWM) volumes were investigated separately. The main objective of this study was to determine whether DTI is more sensitive than conventional MRI at detecting cognitive impairment in SIVD patients.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "Patients with SIVD were recruited from the stroke clinic at the Department of Neurology, Renji Hospital, which is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Most patients had experienced a clinical lacunar stroke at least 3 months prior to recruitment. We used the SIVD imaging criteria suggested by Galluzzi et al. 14 , which require at least moderate white matter hyperintensities on T 2 -weighted MRI plus lacunar infarct(s). These criteria are based on a modification of those for subcortical VaD described by Erkinjuntti et al. 1 , which aims to include milder cases of SIVD.\nAll participants were examined physically and neuropsychiatrically at baseline. Sociodemographic, functional and neuropsychiatric data were collected for each patient. Personal and medical histories were taken from knowledgeable informants (usually the patients spouse) and were focused on the symptoms that might help in differentiating the common types of dementia: implicit and explicit memory, language, executive and behavioral disturbance, disability in daily activities, hallucinations and other psychiatric symptoms. All patients underwent laboratory examinations to exclude systemic or other neurological diseases.\nPatients with the following diseases or conditions were excluded: severe systemic diseases, B 12 deficiency, uncontrolled thyroid disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, cortical andor corticosubcortical nonlacunar infarct, watershed infarcts, WMLs of specific causes (e.g. multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, brain irradiation), Parkinsons disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, alcoholism or illicit drug use. If a patient had a history of early and prominent logic memory (with or without other cognitive dysfunction) but only slight vascular lesions on the MRI, a possible diagnosis of Alzheimers disease was made and the patient was excluded. Unfortunately, there are no methods available to date that allow the unequivocal exclusion of Alzheimers disease in vivo. Although patients with pure Alzheimers disease or Alzheimers disease plus mild cerebral vascular disease were excluded by the history and MRI recruitment criteria mentioned above, Alzheimers pathology may have been present in a fraction of our SIVD patients (mixed VCIAlzheimers disease). In addition, patients with low education levels ( ! 6 years), major depression (Hamiltons depression rating scale 1 18), psychiatric diseases or severe cognitive impairments (those who were unable to perform the neuropsychological tests) were excluded. Those with severe claustrophobia or contraindications to MRI examination (e.g. pacemakers, metallic implants) were also excluded.\nAs a result, a total of 42 recruited patients met the criteria and were further divided into 3 groups based on their individual cognitive status, i.e. NCI (n  18), VCIND (n  14) or VaD (n  10).\nThe hospital research ethics committee approved the study protocol, and written informed consent was given by every subject. MR image analysis was undertaken by a single rater (Y.Z.), who was blind to the neuropsychological findings.",

    "Assessment of Conventional Ischemic Lesions": {
      "text": "Ischemia-related conventional MRI variables included total volumes of T 2 hyperintensity lesions, lacune numbers and visual rating scores of WMLs within the brain.\nWell-defined low-intensity lesions nearly approaching the signal characteristics of the cerebral spinal fluid on T 1 -weighted images and measuring 3-15 mm in diameter were classified as lacunar infarcts 15 . Lesions with these characteristics were considered perivascular spaces if they were  2 mm, unless they were found around the anterior commissure, where perivascular spaces can be large.\nThe number of the lacunes located in the subcortical gray matter and white matter was then calculated.\nWMLs on MRI were ill-defined hyperintensities on both T 2weighted and FLAIR images but isointensities on T 1 -weighted images. Four different regions of WMLs were rated separately using the Age-Related White Matter Change Rating Scale 16 : the frontal area, the parietal-occipital area, the temporal area and the basal ganglia. The definitions of the rating scores (0-3) are as follows: no lesions (score  0); focal lobe lesions or 1 focal basal ganglion lesion (score  1); beginning confluence of lobe lesions or focal basal ganglion lesions (score  2), and diffuse lobe lesions or confluent basal ganglion lesions (score  3). Each patients total score ranged from 0 to 24 bilaterally.\nMRIcro (http:www.mricro.com) was used to view the imaging results. T 2 lesions were manually marked in FLAIR and the inner table of the skull was manually marked in T 1 -weighted sequences of every slice. In-house software based on MATLAB was then used to calculate the total voxels of the T 2 lesions and intracranial volume. Areas of diffuse WMLs and discrete lacunar infarcts were included in the T 2 lesions. Intracranial volume was used in normalizing T 2 lesions.",

Based on the normalized mutual information method using SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK), T 2 -weighted images of the DTI scans were coregistered with the T 1 -weighted images. The same transformation parameters were then used to coregister the MD, FA and FLAIR images. Voxels containing extracerebral tissue were removed from the T 1 -weighted images using a semiautomated technique provided by MRIcro. Next, the corresponding voxels were removed from the MD and FA images. As mentioned above, we marked the lesion in FLAIR, and the same voxels were removed from the T 1 -weighted images using a semiautomated technique provided by MRIcro.\nGray matter, white matter and cerebral spinal fluid were automatically segmented from T 1 -weighted images (with and without the lesions) with the use of the multicontext fuzzy clustering technique 19 , which was chosen due to the insensitivity to intensity inhomogeneity. Each pixel was classified as gray matter, white matter or cerebral spinal fluid.\nThus, the masks of the WBGM, WBWM, normal-appearing gray matter and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were created for all subjects. The resulting masks of these parts were superimposed onto the MD and FA images, resulting in the corresponding MD and FA images.\nMD and FA histograms containing 1,000 bins were created from each part of the MD and FA images. Each bin was normalized by the total number of voxels contributing to the histogram to compensate for variability in brain size. The average value from each MD or FA histogram within WBWM or NAWM was used to characterize water motion.",

None of the subjects suffered a new clinical stroke or transient ischemic attack between the MRI and the assessment. A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was designed to include tests of all cognitive domains, as recommended by VCI harmonization standards 22 . The battery consisted of the following assessments: 30 The norms used were based on mean scores of each measurement from a sample of typical, elderly community members in Shanghai, China. We defined cognitive impairment as a score of 1.5 standard deviations below the mean on any neuropsychological test. Because some of the patients had a degree of disability due to stroke, we carefully determined which part of the disability was cognitive and which was due to the motor sequelae. These determinations were based on patient history and clinical judgment, such as the degree of disability present at the onset of the cognitive impairment or the synchronicity of the progression of cognitive impairment with the progression of the disability. In cases in which the disability appeared or worsened at the time of appearance of the cognitive impairment -and worsened synchronically with the deterioration of cognition -it was determined that the disability was causally related to the cognitive impairment, and thus the patient could not be diagnosed as a case of VCIND.",

Direct comparison of performance among tests was possible as the Z scores for all tests were taken from an identical control population. Raw scores for each of the neuropsychological tests were Z transformed. Next, the Z scores for each domain were generated by averaging the Z scores of their respective tests. Finally, composite Z scores, which represent general intellectual ability, were computed by averaging the Z scores of individual cognitive domains.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, 57.1 (2442) of recruited SIVD patients were cognitively impaired, and 58.3 (1424) of them had VCIND. SIVD is a major substrate of VCI 1 . It covers a wide spectrum of cognitive dysfunction, ranging from subtle and clinically undetectable deficits to overt dementia 22,23 .\nAlthough the 3 groups did not differ statistically in terms of vascular risk factors, vascular lesions on routine MRIs were found, to some extent, to be related to cognition. Significant differences in T 2 lesions, lacune numbers and WML scores were found between VaD patients and NCI patients, but not between VCIND patients and NCI patients. T 2 lesions correlated only with attention-executive measures in SIVD patients. After dividing T 2 lesions into lacunes and WMLs, only lacunes correlated with attention-executive measures. The statistical significance of the correlations no longer existed when VaD subjects were excluded. T 2 hyperintensity lesions on conventional MRI may not be a measure sensitive enough for the early detection of cognitive impairment in SIVD patients.\nThe increase in sensitivity of MRI has led to reduction in both specificity and predictive value of leukoaraiosis, which can now be detected in more than 90 of the elderly 24 . T 2 lesions are mainly comprised of lacunes and WMLs. Frank infarction may be rare in leukoaraiosis compared with WMLs, and the causal pathway between leukoaraiosis and vascular changes is not well understood 25 . Data from an Austrian stroke prevention study have shown that minor punctate hyperintensities often have a nonischemic basis 26 . T 2 lesions on MRI reflect diverse pathological changes of the brain, ranging from complete axonal degeneration to relatively benign pathology with preserved fiber architecture 27 . Thus, the heterogeneity of T 2 lesions may contribute to the lack of sensitivity of routine MRI in predicting cognitive impairment in SIVD patients.\nLacunes and WMLs often coexist in SIVD. The clinical significance of each has been investigated in numer- ous previous studies, but the relevance of these lesions to cognitive decline remains controversial. In a 5-year follow-up study, Wahlund et al. 28 found no significant correlations between the severity of WMLs and the results of any neuropsychological tests. WMLs can also be found in elderly individuals with normal cognitive function, as age is the strongest predictor of their presence and severity 29303132 . Our findings were consistent with what some other studies found. Viswanathan et al. 33 and Mungas et al. 34 reported that lacunar infarcts, but not WMLs, are independently associated with disability and cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, as well as in sporadic SIVD patients. Carey et al. 35 also reported that subcortical lacune numbers, but not WMLs, are associated with poorer executive function in cognitively normal elderly. One possible explanation for this finding is that the degree of lesions of brain tissue correlates with cognitive functions 33 , but not with respect to the extent of the lesions alone. DTI has revolutionized the field of white matter mapping. It provides a framework for the acquisition, analysis and quantification of diffusion properties of white matter 18,36 . Different levels of DTI analysis make it possible to reveal the diffusion properties and architecture of various brain diseases and disorders 37383940 . DTI is even able to outline white matter architecture and reveal structure usually hidden from conventional MRI. For example, it has been reported that microstructural alterations were detected by DTI in patients with Alzheimers disease or other dementias, even though these patients had no obvious lesions on T 2 -weighted MRI. Furthermore, DTI detected white matter changes even prior to the development of dementia in MCI patients 41424344 . Reduced FA in various brain regions was reported in psychiatric diseases in which routine MRI-based radiology had not been able to identify the specific patterns of brain abnormalities 45,46 . Thus, compared with conventional MRI, DTI may provide a more direct and precise assessment of white matter damage, which is now deemed to be the predominant mechanism for cognitive impairment in SIVD patients. However, few DTI studies to date have examined SIVD patients. Correia et al. 47 reported lower mean FA values in ischemic leukoaraiosis patients compared with healthy controls. OSullivan et al. 48 investigated regional DTI indices within periventricular and centrum semiovale white matter. DTI abnormalities were found to extend beyond the visible borders of leukoaraiosis on conventional MRI and showed a more robust association with cognition than leukoaraiosis alone. In the present study, global measurements of MD and FA were performed within WBWM in SIVD patients. Significant group differences were found between VCI (VCIND as well as VaD) and NCI. These indices significantly correlated with cognition measures in all subjects, including those without VaD. This finding suggests that wholebrain DTI served as a sensitive technique for the early detection of cognitive decline in SIVD patients.\nIn addition, a significant increment of MD and a decrement of FA in NAWM were also found in cognitively impaired patients (VCIND and VaD) compared with cognitively normal patients. DTI indices within NAWM also showed consistent and strong correlations with the results of cognitive tests, even after VaD patients had been excluded. This finding suggests that the interruption of NAWM integrity may be an important factor for cognitive deterioration in SIVD patients. Increased recognition of the importance of incomplete infarction and hypoperfusion informs the belief that VCI may be present even in the absence of abnormalities on conventional MRI, and the prognosis of such VCI patients may not be good 49 . It might be reasonable to assume that subjects with a similar extent of T 2 lesions could have variable degrees of interruption of white matter integrity, either within T 2 lesions or within NAWM. This studys DTI findings within NAWM support the finding that there are relatively weak (or even nonexistent) relationships between cognition and lesions routinely assessed by MRI.\nAccumulation of brain hyperintensities and loss of brain volume often coexist in SIVD patients. Of the measures derived from conventional MRI, brain atrophy was reported to be strongly related to cognitive impairment in SIVD 50,51 . The pathology is variable and may reflect a combination of degenerative and ischemic lesions 9,52 . In this study, normalized WBGM and WBWM volumes were adopted as global cerebral atrophy indices, and hippocampal volumes were used as regional cerebral atrophy indices. Differences in WBGM volume were found only between VaD and NCI, but not between VCIND and NCI. WBGM volumes correlated with the Z scores of all cognitive domains, except language. However, there were no such correlations when VaD patients were excluded. WBWM volumes and hippocampal volumes showed no differences between the 3 groups. WBWM volumes correlated with none of the cognitive domains, whereas hippocampal volumes only correlated weakly with memory tests (p  0.05). The clinical relevance of brain atrophy may be less significant than that of white matter disintegrity in SIVD, especially in milder cases. Thus, neither global nor regional measurement of Xu ZhouLi Cao Lin Pan Chen Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 2010;30:317-326 324 brain atrophy on conventional MRI was able to detect early cognitive decline in SIVD patients.\nThe cognitive syndrome of SIVD is characterized by a dysexecutive syndrome with slowdown in mental processing and relatively mild memory deficits 1,2 . Our patients showed a similar pattern of cognitive impairment. DTI indices within WBWM and NAWM correlated not only with executive measures, but also with memory measures in SIVD patients. These correlations remained statistically significant after controlling for T 2 lesions and hippocampal volumes. Thus, the executive and memory dysfunctions in SIVD patients were independently caused by the disruption of white matter integrity. Another interesting finding is that no statistically significant correlation between DTI indices and memory tests was found after further controlling for executive function. A similar result was obtained in the study of Jokinen et al. 53 . Such a finding suggests that executive functions mediate the relationship between white matter damage and memory performance in SIVD patients. The findings of our DTI study suggest that language and visuospatial functions are not primarily dependent on the integrity of subcortical structures, as visuospatial tests correlated with WBGM volumes in our patients. Correia et al. 47 reported that DTI metrics correlated very weakly with Boston Naming Test results and did not approach significance. Several studies have found that language and visuospatial functions were more strongly impacted by cortical disease 15,54 . In the present study, the MMSE could not discriminate VCIND from NCI. This may be due to the fact that the MMSE insufficiently probes executive function and is insensitive to subtle memory impairment.\nThe whole-brain DTI histogram analysis employed in the present study is a more global approach compared with the region of interest method used in most DTI studies 41,43,44,55,56 . As previously mentioned, significant changes in DTI measures were found in both the abnormal white matter and NAWM as observed with conventional MRI in various diseases 3738394045464748 . DTI studies revealed microstructural alterations in extensive areas in cognitively impaired patients 56 . This finding suggests that the local measurement of diffusion may not be relevant to monitoring the progression of tissue damage in such a diffuse condition. There may also be a problem when dealing with smaller fiber systems in which partial volume occurs and the identification of the fiber system location is difficult 57 . Whole-brain DTI takes into account all white matter areas, including regions that appear normal or abnormal on conventional MRI, and thus, it compares groups on overall white matter integrity. This method may provide more robust markers of white matter structural integrity than scalar DTI measures taken from region of interest analyses 47 . In our study, consistent results were yielded by almost all DTI parameters related to cognitive functions, even after VaD patients had been excluded. Hence, whole-brain DTI may provide a global estimate of microscopic tissue damage within the brain. It may therefore be used as a reliable and sensitive technique for the early detection of cognitive impairment, as well as for monitoring the overall disease progression in SIVD patients.\nThe present study has some limitations worthy of mention. First, because the sample size was not big and the majority of the observed subjects were male, the findings of this study might not be generalized to the whole population. Second, because it was a cross-sectional study, we are unable to conclude that DTI predicts cognitive impairment through a continuum of VCI progression in SIVD patients. Hence, a longitudinal study is to be conducted to further confirm this hypothesis. Third, mild and subclinical strokes may have occurred during recruitment. Because diffusion-weighted imaging was not included in our MRI settings, we may have underestimated very fresh infarcts in our subjects. Future studies should focus on determining whether the heterogeneities of T 2 lesions assessed by DTI have an independent impact on cognitive function. Another approach would be to make a direct comparison between DTI and conventional MRI on NAWM measurements, especially in milder cases.",

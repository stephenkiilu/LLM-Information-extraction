    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies, using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), suggest impaired perivascular space (PVS) function in cerebral small vessel disease, but they were cross-sectional, making inferences on causality difficult. We determined associations between impaired PVS, measured using DTI-ALPS and PVS volume, and cognition and incident dementia. METHODS: In patients with lacunar stroke and confluent white matter hyperintensities, without dementia at baseline, recruited prospectively in a single center, magnetic resonance imaging was performed annually for 3 years, and cognitive assessments, including global, memory, executive function, and processing speed, were performed annually for 5 years. We determined associations between DTI-ALPS and PVS volume with cerebral small vessel disease imaging markers (white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunes, and microbleeds) at baseline and with changes in imaging markers. We determined whether DTI-ALPS and PVS volume at baseline and change over 3 years predicted incident dementia. Analyses were controlled for conventional diffusion tensor image metrics using 2 markers (median mean diffusivity MD and peak width of skeletonized MD) and adjusted for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients, mean age 70.0 years and 65.0 male, were included. DTI-ALPS declined over 3 years, while no change in PVS volume was found. Neither DTI-ALPS nor PVS volume was associated with cerebral small vessel disease imaging marker progression. Baseline DTI-ALPS was associated with changes in global cognition (β0.142, P0.032), executive function (β0.287, P0.027), and long-term memory (β0.228, P0.027). Higher DTI-ALPS at baseline predicted a lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 0.328 0.183-0.588; P0.001), and this remained significant after including median MD as a covariate (hazard ratio, 0.290 0.139-0.602; P0.001). Change in DTI-ALPS predicted dementia conversion (hazard ratio, 0.630 0.428-0.964; P0.048), but when peak width of skeletonized MD and median MD were entered as covariates, the association was not significant. There was no association between baseline PVS volume, or PVS change over 3 years, and conversion to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: DTI-ALPS predicts future dementia risk in patients with lacunar strokes and confluent white matter hyperintensities. However, the weakening of the association between change in DTI-ALPS and incident dementia after controlling for peak width of skeletonized MD and median MD suggests part of the signal may represent conventional diffusion tensor image metrics. PVS volume is not a predictor of future dementia risk.",

      "text": "erebral small vessel disease (CSVD) describes disease in the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries in the brain. 1 It causes a quarter of strokes, is the most common pathology underlying vascular dementia, 1 and its presence increases the likelihood that neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer disease result in clinical dementia. 2 Perivascular space (PVS) dysfunction has recently emerged as a pathophysiological mechanism in CSVD progression. 3 The PVS comprises a network of spaces surrounding cerebral microvessels, serving as conduits for fluid transport, exchange between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid, and the clearance of waste products from the brain. 4 The enlargement of PVS, leading to their visibility on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicates potential obstruction by protein and cell debris, resulting in the stagnation of fluid drainage. 5 This phenomenon is commonly observed in CSVD. Both the rating scale for PVS severity and the PVS volume quantification methods are associated with other CSVD imaging markers. 6789 Spatial relationship studies have revealed that white matter hyperintensities (WMH) often surround enlarged PVS, suggesting that these enlarged PVS could be a factor in the progression of WMH and possibly other CSVD imaging markers. 10,11 However, longitudinal analyses exploring its correlation with CSVD progression are lacking. Additionally, PVS enlargement has been linked to all cause dementia, 12,13 although not all studies have replicated this association. 141516 The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the PVS (DTI-ALPS) method provides an additional marker for assessing the PVS function. 17 It measures the directionality and magnitude of water diffusion along PVS. 18 Previous studies using this approach have revealed correlations between DTI-ALPS and vascular risk factors, 19 with other imaging markers of CSVD, 20 and with cognitive performance. 21 However, it is important to note that the existing studies have been primarily cross-sectional, and whether the associations reported are causal is uncertain. One important consideration is the potential confounding effect of conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as mean diffusivity (MD) and peak width of skeletonized MD (PSMD), on DTI-ALPS, because the DTI-ALPS metric is obtained from the DTI sequence. MD assesses general alterations in brain tissues without directional specificity, while PSMD evaluates variations of MD on a skeleton. This is relevant because MD has demonstrated high sensitivity as a disease marker in CSVD and is associated with both cognition and the prediction of future dementia risk. 22 Therefore, it is important to establish that any relationship between DTI-ALPS and CSVD is independent of conventional DTI metrics.\nTo better understand the significance of PVS markers and their relationship to cognition in CSVD, in a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients with lacunar and confluent WMH CSVD, we examined associations between PVS markers and MRI markers of CSVD severity and whether they predicted incident dementia over a 5-year follow-up. When examining associations with DTI-ALPS, we controlled for conventional DTI metrics.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, we found that a novel magnetic resonance marker of PVS function (DTI-ALPS) predicted both dementia and cognitive decline over a 5-year follow-up period in patients with CSVD. Many previous studies have shown associations between DTI-ALPS and cognition in CSVD, but these have been largely cross-sectional, 20,30,31 with few longitudinal studies, 21 and cannot determine whether PVS diffusion, as measured on DTI-ALPS, causally contributes to CSVD progression. Our data, demonstrating its predictive ability for dementia over a 5-year follow-up, support a potential causal role in cognitive impairment in CSVD. We showed that baseline DTI-ALPS not only predicted cognitive decline and incident dementia but also that change in DTI-ALPS metrics over the initial 3-year period, when annual MRI scans were performed, predicted dementia over the 5-year follow-up period, further supporting a causal association. DTI-ALPS is derived from the DTI sequence and measures diffusion along the PVS. However, it is possible that it might also be influenced by and merely act as another measure of conventional DTI metrics such as MD, which itself has been shown to be a strong predictor of cognitive decline and dementia. 25 Therefore, we controlled for 2 conventional DTI metrics in our analysis: MD and PSMD, an automated method of measuring diffusivity within the WM tracts. Associations between baseline DTI-ALPS and both cognition and dementia remained significant after controlling for median MD or PSMD. The associations between changes in DTI-ALPS and dementia did not remain after controlling for PSMD or MD. This suggests that part of the DTI-ALPS signal change could be describing conventional DTI metrics such as MD.\nDTI-ALPS is being increasingly used to explore the role of glymphatic dysfunction in a variety of neurological diseases. It was first proposed in 2017 17 and assesses the movement of water molecules in different directions in the PVS. Specifically, it allows evaluation of diffusivity parallel to PVS surrounding medullary veins at the level of the lateral ventricles. A validation study reported a good correlation with glymphatic function determined using classical contrast injection techniques, 18 and it has good reproducibility both in single-center 32 and across scanner studies. 33 Our data showed consistent results across time points with a gradual decline over time. Recent studies have shown DTI-ALPS changes in patients with a variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer disease, 17 Parkinson disease, 34 and traumatic brain injury. 35 Many cross-sectional studies have also implicated glymphatic dysfunction assessed by DTI-ALPS in patients with CSVD 18,20 and vascular risk factors 19 and have reported associations with the severity of cognitive impairment in both CSVD and vascular cognitive impairment 30,31 and Alzheimer disease. 36 However, few studies have determined whether DTI-ALPS changes predict future cognitive decline and dementia.\nOur study provides novel data supporting this association and is consistent with recent data from Parkinson disease reporting that DTI-ALPS predicted future cognitive decline. 37 Taken together, our data support a role of glymphatic dysfunction in mediating cognitive decline in CSVD, consistent with animal data suggesting a role of glymphatic dysfunction in CSVD progression. Rodent models of CSVD, particularly spontaneous hypertensive rats, have demonstrated glymphatic dysfunction, including reduced CSF fluid dynamics evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and loss of aquaporin-4, a crucial channel for glymphatic function. 38,39 We further explored associations between DTI-ALPS and other markers of CSVD burden to determine whether the association was mediated via other markers of CSVD severity. In cross-sectional analysis, DTI-ALPS was highly significantly associated with WMH volume, number of lacunes, and both PSMD and median MD, consistent with previous reports. 20 However, there was little association between DTI-ALPS and the progression of other neuroimaging markers of CSVD. Baseline DTI-ALPS was only associated with WMH progression, but the association did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. A change in DTI-ALPS was not associated with either the progression of WMH or a change in the number of lacunes. It was associated with a change in median MD, but caution needs to be made in interpreting this due to DTI-ALPS being derived from the DTI sequence. We cannot exclude an association with WMH, and the 3-year MRI follow-up may provide too short a time to detect associations. However, it raises the possibility that the association between DTI-ALPS and cognitive decline may not be mediated by conventional MRI markers of CSVD.\nIn contrast to associations with DTI-ALPS, we found no associations between baseline PVS, or change in PVS volume, and cognitive decline or dementia. This is consistent with and extends the results, of our previous study. 15 There have been conflicting results from studies of the associations between PVS and cognition, but a metaanalysis of 5 population-based studies failed to find an association, consistent with our findings. 14 Several factors could underlie this lack of association. Enlarged PVS may reflect an end stage of glymphatic dysfunction, in contrast to the more dynamic changes detected on DTI-ALPS, which are likely to detect glymphatic dysfunction at an earlier stage. We also found that, while interobserver agreement in measurement of PVS volume was high, PVS volume varied markedly across time points in some individuals, and this would reduce the chance of detecting any association. Furthermore, from a mechanistic perspective, PVS volume primarily assesses the periarteriolar spaces, 40 which are more closely related to influx, while DTI-ALPS evaluates diffusivity along the deep medullary space, 2 effectively detecting the efflux ability of glymphatic function and may be more relevant to the retention of toxic substances in the brain.\nOur study has several strengths. We used a prospective longitudinal cohort, allowing us to determine whether DTI-ALPS and PVS predict future dementia risk. Importantly, we controlled for conventional DTI markers in our analysis. It also has limitations. Imaging was performed on a 1.5T scanner, and the resolution of the DTI was not as high as on newer scanners. PVS were identified and differentiated from lacunar infarcts by an expert neuroradiologist. The neuroradiologist was blinded to clinical and cognitive information. However, we did not assess the interobserver measurement of PVS volume. The exclusion of older subjects with lower NART-IQ scores might introduce selection bias into our findings, and further studies with older subjects are required to assess this.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that DTI-ALPS, but not PVS volume, predicts future dementia risk. Our results would support the role of glymphatic dysfunction in cognitive impairment in CSVD, although the weakening of longitudinal associations after controlling for MD suggests that part of the DTI-ALPS signal may represent conventional DTI metrics such as MD. Further studies are required with larger sample sizes, longitudinal follow-up, and the inclusion of more patients with mild CSVD. It is important that these control for conventional DTI markers, as we did in our study. If these replicate an association between DTI-ALPS and the prediction of future cognitive decline and dementia, then DTI-ALPS could potentially serve as a marker for predicting the risk of future dementia.",

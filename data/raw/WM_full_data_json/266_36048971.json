    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a common form of dementia-a syndrome that is marked by a severe decline in cognitive ability and which interferes with the ability to live independently. Depending on the level of cognitive impairment, AD can be differentiated into preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia stage (Kumar et al., 2021). AD and its clinical staging and mechanism have been studied extensively via its pathological findings of abnormal protein deposits, amyloid plaques and fibrillary tangles in the brain (e.g., Hyman et al., 2012;Jack et al., 2018). However, any degenerative changes in white matter (WM) tract that precede the loss of grey matter can occur years before the onset of symptoms (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Nir et al., 2013;Wassenaar et al., 2018;Wen et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2014). WM degeneration affecting myelination, myelin thickness, axon diameter and packing density is considered to predict AD in vivo and correlates with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers Aβ plaques (Aβ42) and (phosphorylated-) Tau proteins (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Bennett  Madden, 2014;Fjell et al., 2014;Hoy et al., 2017;Jack et al., 2018;Rieckmann et al., 2016;Strain et al., 2018;Wassenaar et al., 2018).\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures has revealed microstructural WM differences between AD and control patients within the corpus callosum (CC), temporal lobe, frontal lobe and overall significant decreased connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) (Gao et al., 2020;Li et al., 2021;Mito et al., 2018;S anchez et al., 2020), involving temporal WM starting in preclinical AD patients (Hoy et al., 2017;Mito et al., 2018;Nishioka et al., 2015;Weiler et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2014). AD should be considered as a largescale disconnection syndrome that may be associated with aggregation of toxic proteins and severe brain atrophy (Pereira et al., 2019). Fractional anisotropy (FA) along with three other DTI measurable variables of diffusivity within DTI reflects fibre density, axonal diameter and myelination. The changes of these variables reflect changes in microstructure of the WM tract and provide a more sensitive biomarker for AD (Bennett  Madden, 2014;Daianu et al., 2013;Jack et al., 2018;Kantarci et al., 2017;Nir et al., 2013;Schaeffer et al., 2021;Sepehrband et al., 2019;Song et al., 2005;Wassenaar et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2014). Mean diffusivity (MD) represents the average diffusion process in three directions (Wen et al., 2018). Loss of myelin results in the loss of fibre directionality, lower FA and higher MD, which are found in neurodegenerative diseases (Bennett  Madden, 2014;Kantarci et al., 2017;Nir et al., 2013), and also in individuals with increased genetic risk for AD (Rieckmann et al., 2016). MD correlated with other CSF markers, tau and amyloid protein (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Nir et al., 2013), and is the most sensitive marker of the WM integrity among DTI measures, compared with measurements of volumetric reduction in identifying patients with MCI who will progress to AD (Araque Caballero et al., 2018;Fjell et al., 2014;Jack et al., 2018;Nir et al., 2015;Rieckmann et al., 2016;Wen et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2014;Zhuang et al., 2013). The additional DTI measurements are axial diffusivity (AxD) in quantifying the diffusion parallel to axons and radial diffusivity (RD) reflecting the diffusions perpendicular to the axon (Alexander et al., 2007). AxD and RD changes have been shown to be markers for axonal damage and myelin damage, respectively (Bennett  Madden, 2014;Song et al., 2005). RD changes in AD have a similar trend as that seen with MD, which is the composite of AxD and RD (Rieckmann et al., 2016). Furthermore, MD and FA are associated with performance on clinical cognitive tests, such as the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (Nir et al., 2015;Wen et al., 2018), with AD staging and with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the fornix (FX), cingulum tracts, entorhinal cortex and medial parietal cortex (Kantarci et al., 2017).\nThe analysis of the complete brain WM profile of all the available DTI data and its key components in AD compared with CN is incomplete. It is not known what specific WM regions are critical for triggering AD symptoms in patients with poor cognitive performance MMSE score and hippocampus atrophy. Further, limited studies on brain hemispheric asymmetry or lateralization in AD showed asymmetric neurodegeneration depending on the stages of AD and variability, and its link to pathogenesis and progression of AD is unclear (Lubben et al., 2021;Minkova et al., 2017). Additionally, the literature shows that age may have an impact on the pathogenesis of AD, whereas the impact of sex and education level is inconsistent (Fjell et al., 2014;Ribeiro et al., 2022). The present study examined the DTI measures of the WM tract throughout the brain WM tracts of AD patients and normal controls with use of data obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and any laterality of connectivity in the two hemispheres. Further, we examined the associations of age, gender and education with DTI measures. Lastly, we used variable cluster analysis to identify the most important structures among the major WM tracts that are affected in AD.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The present study comprehensively mapped all the major WM tracts in AD compared with CN, including both hemispheres using all four DTI measures, their association with age, gender and education using the ADNI data. Additionally, we pinpointed the key structures linked to cognitive performance and hippocampal volume underlying AD using clusters analysis. Significant associations with DTI measures were found in WM tracts connecting frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, suggesting the myelination and axonal integrity have been damaged. By using a larger AD population sample than previous one (e.g., Nir et al., 2013), we showed the complete profile of significant changes (increased diffusivity and reduced FA) in all the four DTI measures in ROIs of SCC, FX, FX-ST and TAP_L, with increased diffusivity of MD, RD, AxD in additional WM tracts, SUMCC, CGH, PTR_L, UNC and SS. The present study found that the CST is spared. The changes explain the cardinal signs of disturbance in limbic functions (memory and emotion) in AD patients. Motor disturbance could appear in more advanced states of AD. Among age, gender and education, age has significant association with DTI measures, increased diffusivity and reduced anisotropy FA. Gender and education level has no association with these DTI measures. Finally, CGC, CGH, IFO and UNC are significantly correlated with MMSE and hippocampal volumes among all the examined WM tracts. Right CGC and right UNC are uniquely correlated in AD, not in CN.\nF I G U R E 1 Variable cluster analysis of MD measures and MMSE and hippocampus for both AD and CN (n  84). MD refers to mean diffusivity; MMSE refers to mini-mental state examination. These variables were grouped into four clusters with strong relationships among variables in each cluster. MMSE had strong correlations with CGC, CGH, IFO, UNC measures and hippocampus volume and were grouped within a cluster. Abbreviations for the brain regions: SUMGCC, bilateral genu of corpus callosum; SUMBCC, bilateral body of corpus callosum; SUMSCC, bilateral splenium of corpus callosum; SUMCC, bilateral full corpus callosum; GCC, genu of corpus callosum; BCC, body of corpus callosum; SCC, splenium of corpus callosum; SUMFX, bilateral fornix; FX, fornix (column and body); CGH, cingulum hippocampus; CGC, cingulate gyrus; UNC, uncinate fasciculus; SFO, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; IFO, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; SCR, superior corona radiata; ACR, anterior corona radiata; SS, sagittal stratum; PTR, posterior thalamic radiation Circuitries for memory, emotion and senses underlying AD are affected differently. First, studies have shown that changes in circuitry for memory and emotion underlie AD, including the DMN network for episodic memory involving medial entorhinal, medial orbitofrontal and lateral frontal, precuneus, middle temporal hippocampus and inferior parietal cortex (Aggleton et al., 2016;Bigham et al., 2020;Fjell et al., 2014). The present study identified that MD changes existed in these regions, overlapping with DMN including the cingulum, hippocampus and FX and other WM tracts connecting the brain lobes. Specifically, our cluster analysis identified that hippocampus, cingulate gyrushippocampus (CGC and CGH), IFO and UNC are highly correlated in one cluster with MD changes associated with MMSE cognitive phenotypes for both AD and CN, providing a more specific model than previously proposed (Qin et al., 2021). Furthermore, our findings of changes in the PTR support previous results suggesting that thalamic pathology is implicated in the early stage of AD contributing to emotional disturbance (Wen et al., 2018). Especially, our finding of age being significantly associated with MD changes in FX-ST (not FX) suggested that aging significantly affects emotional processing (see Figure S2A). Lastly, FA reduction in the regions of SCC, and TAP might explain the visual disturbance and other loss of special senses in MCI and AD patients (Nishioka et al., 2015;Wassenaar et al., 2018). Primary somatosensory and motor areas are least affected at least at the early stage of AD.\nPrevious studies have shown that a breakdown in connectivity occurs during the aging process in normal individuals with gradual decline of FA and increased MD and RD (Bennett  Madden, 2014;Zhuang et al., 2013) and in the early stage of AD (Zhang et al., 2014). Our results showed that this breakdown is particularly exacerbated in the left side of the brain with more ROIs involved, that is, brain asymmetry. Indeed, we found a more significant impact of age on DTI values than gender and education. This is consistent with what we know about aging being a contributing factor (correlating with cortical thinness) towards the development of AD, with annual atrophy of entorhinal cortex, progressing to the parietal, frontal regions and ultimately to all regions of cortex (Fjell et al., 2014). It is hypothesized that the limbic area is the most vulnerable due to the demand of neuroplasticity in the face of lesion and other injury insults.\nIn contrast to normal aging, the AD processes lead to greater impact on tempo-parietal cortex, including entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, which is involved in episodic memory (Fjell et al., 2014). The present study did not find significant differences in DTI measures between genders, consistent with previous findings (Wu et al., 2011) et al., 2012). We did not find that education has any significant effect on DTI measures either. Similarly, previous findings have shown that the effect of education or intellectual activities on brain biomarkers such as amyloid deposition is ambiguous (Fjell et al., 2014).\nWe found a significant MD increase in CC, FX, cingulum, UNC, SFO and IFO, SCR, sagittal striatum and thalamic radiation, the areas that are vulnerable for modifiable risk factors for AD (Wassenaar et al., 2018). Importantly, our study used cluster analysis and pinpointed the key WM structural changes in the brain connectivity in AD associated with cognitive test MMSE and hippocampal volume changes. These six ROIs are right CGC, bilateral hippocampal cingulum, bilateral IFO and F I G U R E 3 Variable cluster analysis of MD measures and MMSE and hippocampus (volume) in AD (n  42). MD refers to mean diffusivity; MMSE refers to mini-mental state examination. These variables were grouped into four clusters with strong relationships among variables in each cluster. MMSE had strong correlations with CGC, CGH, IFO, UNC measures and hippocampus volume and were grouped within a cluster. Abbreviations for the brain regions: SUMGCC, bilateral genu of corpus callosum; SUMBCC, bilateral body of corpus callosum; SUMSCC, bilateral splenium of corpus callosum; SUMCC, bilateral full corpus callosum; GCC, genu of corpus callosum; BCC, body of corpus callosum; SCC, splenium of corpus callosum; SUMFX, bilateral fornix; FX, fornix (column and body); CGH, cingulum hippocampus; CGC, cingulate gyrus; UNC, uncinate fasciculus; SFO, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; IFO, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; SCR, superior corona radiata; ACR, anterior corona radiata; SS, sagittal stratum; PTR, posterior thalamic radiation right UNC which are worthwhile to be studied further in depth. Among the above regions, changes in the right CGC and right UNC are unique to AD patients, not in CN. UNC is subjacent to IFO, connecting frontal and temporal cortex, its function is not well defined. The right CGC is correlated with smell loss in COVID-19 patients (Lu et al., 2020). The loss of the connection with right CGC and uncinate might explain the loss of smell, a very early symptom of AD. Compared with a previous study (e.g., Nir et al., 2013), we were able to narrow down the key structures to right CGC and right UNC, that is responsible for the declined cognitive performance MMSE scores in AD. Studying the pattern of changes in brain regions will help to elucidate what triggers the switch to AD disease progression, for example, accelerated atrophy in the temporal cortex, the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex (Fjell et al., 2014). AD starts with subtle cognitive changes identified over 10 years before the onset of dementia. Our study suggests that right CGC and right UNC could be such a trigger switch to AD; then, the disconnectivity spreads to the left side of the brain regions leading to impairment in language skills. Finally, further identification and characterization of the specific WM degeneration and synaptic loss within AD may help distinguish its neuropathology from other forms of dementia such as Lewy body disease. A thorough examination of the nature and location of WM degeneration within AD may help with the staging of AD and in early diagnosis.\nThis study has several strengths. First, we compared the DTI measures between AD and CN using multivariable linear regression model and adjusted for age, gender and education. Second, we performed variable cluster analysis of MD measures and MMSE and HPV. In addition, the present study also examined the effects of age, gender and education on the DTI measures. We acknowledge some limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small although the use of multivariable linear regression analysis could achieve power close to 80. Second, to reduce ethnic heterogeneity, this study just used non-Hispanic white individuals; therefore, the results limit the generalizability of the findings to explore effects both within and across the groups for non-White populations (African American and Hispanic).

Third, this study focused on comparison of AD with CN. In the future, it will be interesting to further compare DTI measures of MCI with CN.\nOur study suggests that the functions of WM tracts, CGC, hippocampal cingulum, long associative fibre tract IFO and the short UNC play important roles in cognitive memory test MMSE. In particular, breakdown of right CGC and right UNC in AD links to poor MMSE performance and atrophy of hippocampal volume. Among the structures studied, the DTI measure of these two structures (CGC-R and UNC-R) might provide a sensitive early biomarker for Alzheimers disease.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "In summary, our findings support the use of DTI measures for early detection of the onset of AD, in particular, the right CGC and the right UNC should be the WM tracts of focus, based on cluster analysis. Second, this research supported the view that the WM disconnectivity and brain asymmetry being the source of pathogenesis in AD. Among the WM tracts, the CC (including TAP), FX, CGH, UNC, sagittal striatum, left PTR and fornix-stria terminalis showed significant increases in diffusivity, whereas only splenium of CC and FX showed significant decreases in FA among AD patients. Finally, aging is the main risk factor associated with the change of these DTI measures in AD, not gender or education level.\nSignificant correlations were found among DTI measures in MD, outcomes of MMSE and HPV. Increased MD in right CGC and right UNC correlated to a poor cognitive memory task performance in AD but not in CN. This detailed study of individual brain WM tracts supported that DTI measures (especially MD) in CGC and UNC (right side) can be a sensitive biomarker in predicting, clinical staging and monitoring treatment of AD.",

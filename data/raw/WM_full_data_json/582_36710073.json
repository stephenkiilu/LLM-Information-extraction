    "abstract": "Many factors outside of cardiovascular health can impact the structure of white matter. Identification of reliable and clinically meaningful biomarkers of the neural effects of systemic and cardiovascular health are needed to refine etiologic predictions. We examined whether the corpus callosum demonstrates regional vulnerability to systemic cardiovascular risk factors. Three hundred and ninety-four older adults without dementia completed brain MRI, neurobehavioral evaluations, and blood draws. A subset (n  126, n  128) of individuals had blood plasma analyzed for inflammatory markers of interest (IL-6 and TNF-alpha). Considering diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a particularly reliable measure of white matter integrity, we utilized DTI to examine fractional anisotropy (FA) of anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum. Using multiple linear regression models, we simultaneously examined FA of the genu and the splenium to compare their associations with systemic and cardiovascular risk factors. Lower FA of the genu but not splenium was associated with greater systemic and cardiovascular risk, including higher systolic blood pressure (β  -0.17, p  .020), hemoglobin A1C (β  -0.21, p  .016) and IL-6 (β  -0.34, p  .005). FA of the genu was uniquely associated with cognitive processing speed (β  0.20, p  .0015) and executive functioning (β  0.15, p  .012), but not memory performances (β  0.05, p  .357). Our results demonstrated differential vulnerability of the corpus callosum, such that frontal regions showed stronger, independent associations with biomarkers of systemic and cardiovascular health in comparison to posterior regions. Posterior white matter integrity may not reflect cardiovascular health. Clinically, these findings support the utility of examining the anterior corpus callosum as an indicator of cerebrovascular health.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Integrity of cerebral white matter is fundamental for brain health, and can be a sensitive biomarker of cognitive changes, even in typically aging older adults. 1,2 Several studies have shown a strong association between white matter integrity and age-related cognitive decline. 3,4 More specifically, declines in executive functioning, processing speed, and decision-making abilities have been associated with reduced integrity of the white matter in otherwise typically aging adults. 567 White matter integrity is also increasingly implicated in the development of dementia due to a range of etiologies. 8,9 In clinical practice, white matter injury (regardless of location) is often attributed systemic and cardiovascular health. Indeed, several studies do demonstrate associations between hypertension, elevated heart rate, and diabetes with vascular dementia. 1011121314 Metabolic (hemoglobin A1C) and inflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) biomarkers have also been closely associated with altered white matter integrity, demonstrating the importance of systemic cardiovascular factors for the health of cerebral white matter. 151617 However, there is accumulating literature suggesting that white matter changes may reflect processes beyond an individuals cardiovascular health.\nIndicators of white matter changes on brain MRI can reflect degeneration related to etiologies other than vascular disease. For instance, studies have demonstrated associations between Alzheimers disease pathology and degree of white matter hyperintensities, such that greater white matter injury relates to increased beta-amyloid accumulation and tau deposition. 1819202122 Additionally, degradation of white matter has been associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, highlighting involvement of white matter health in other neurodegenerative pathologies as well. 23 Previous studies have also demonstrated some degree of regional specificity in cerebral white matter, 24 which is important in distinguishing the effects of cardiovascular disease from other progressive, neurogenerative diseases in older adults. For instance, greater white matter hyperintensities in frontal regions have been preferentially associated with cardiovascular disease. 25 Consequently, it is increasingly important to identify robust, invivo monitoring tools to aid in differentiating when white matter burden is reflective of systemic and cardiovascular health versus other more progressive disease pathologies.\nThe corpus callosum is an easily detected, large bundle of white matter that is considered a reliable MRI signal of white matter integrity. 26 In particular, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corpus callosum has demonstrated effectiveness in differentiating early-stage neurodegenerative processes from normal aging and has been associated with cognitive impairment. 27282930 DTI of the corpus callosum may be particularly sensitive to early white matter changes, considering it has been associated with cognition even in typically aging adults, whereas other imaging markers (i.e., white matter hyperintensities) may be more reflective of end stage white matter disease. 22,31 These characteristics underscore the potential utility of using DTI of the corpus callosum as a clinically meaningful measure of the effects cardiovascular health on the brain.\nIn the current study, we aimed to examine whether the corpus callosum demonstrates specific regional vulnerability to systemic and cardiovascular risk in a large, carefully characterized cohort of older adults without dementia. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measured via DTI as proxies for white matter integrity, we examined the independent relationships between the integrity of anterior (genu) versus posterior (splenium) regions of the corpus callosum as simultaneous predictors in the same model, against a panel of systemic and cardiovascular health indicators in a large cohort of older adults without dementia. A sample of older adults without dementia is ideal for assessing the utility of regional corpus callosum DTI metrics (such as FA and MD) to detect age-related changes related to cardiovascular health less impacted by overt neurodegenerative disease. Considering previously demonstrated associations between systemic vascular risk and white matter, we hypothesized that higher systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, resting heart rate, and inflammatory protein levels (IL-6, TNF-alpha) would relate to lower white matter integrity. Moreover, we hypothesized that greater systemic and cardiovascular risk would relate with decreased integrity of the genu independent of the integrity of the splenium.",

Diffusion images were processed using FSL 32 and Dipy 33 utilities. The diffusion direction images were co-registered to the b  0 image using FSL MCFLIRT 34 . Background voxels not considered as brain tissue were then masked out of the diffusion volumes by applying a median Otsu function Gradient direction eddy current and distortion correction were applied to the realigned images. Diffusion tensors were fitted using Dipy 33 with a non-linear least-squares approach. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) derived from the fitted tensor was reconstructed in the native space for quality control. A group template was created by registering all subjects full tensor images to each other through iterative linear and non-linear registration algorithms using DTI-TK software. 35 By using the full tensor image of each subject, DTI-TK maximizes the alignment of white matter structures and minimizes interpolation of the diffusion images. Deformations were applied to bring each subjects FA and MD images to group template space and to the standard space atlas ICBM-DTI-81 36 to extract tracts of interest. For the present study, we chose the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum as our tracts of interest.",

We examined variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity in each of our regression models.

Controlling for age, sex, and years of education, lower FA of the genu, but not splenium, was associated with greater systemic and cardiovascular risk (See Table 2). Specifically, higher systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin A1C were both related to lower FA of the genu, independent of FA of the splenium. In contrast, in the same model, higher systolic blood pressure significantly related to FA of the splenium, but in the opposite (positive) direction than FA of the genu. Higher concentrations of plasma inflammatory protein IL-6 were also associated with lower FA of the genu (See Figure 1). Interestingly, in each model, the splenium parameter evidenced positive though largely nonsignificant associations with cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of systolic blood pressure. We examined VIF for all models to assess if multicollinearity may be contributing to findings and found all VIFs were in the acceptable range (VIFs  2.5). Resting heart rate and TNF-alpha were not significantly associated with either the genu or splenium (See Figure 1; Table 2).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The current study aimed to determine whether there are regional differences in susceptibility of the corpus callosum to cardiovascular risk. Indeed, our results demonstrate differential vulnerability of the corpus callosum, such that the frontal regions (genu) show associations with biomarkers of systemic and cardiovascular health above and beyond the effect of posterior portions of the corpus callosum (splenium). More specifically, higher blood pressure and blood sugar level correlated with greater disruption of frontal white matter microstructure, even after controlling for age, sex, and education. Interestingly, hemoglobin A1C significantly related to anterior white matter health even in a sample of individuals without diabetes, demonstrating possible sensitivity of this blood sugar metric to detect lower integrity in this brain region.\nInflammation was also associated with frontal white matter, such that higher concentrations of plasma inflammatory cytokine IL-6 related to worse integrity of white matter in the genu. Importantly, we found a dissociation such that each of these cardiovascular risk factors did not consistently meaningfully relate with posterior white matter integrity. Therefore, lower frontal white matter integrity in older adults appears to reflect cardiovascular health, while posterior white matter integrity may not. Taken together, white matter injury found on neuroimaging should not always be attributed cardiovascular disease or risk. While this study was not designed to examine the effect of other pathologies that are potentially more relevant to posterior white matter integrity (e.g., Alzheimers pathology), our findings suggest there may be less of an impact of cardiovascular risk in this region. The association found between cardiovascular risk and white matter microstructure in the genu (but not the splenium) also has high clinical relevance as a potentially easily detected, specific indicator of cerebrovascular disease.\nWhile the exact underlying mechanism(s) for increased frontal vulnerability are not yet completely clear. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated a disproportionate impact of vascular disease on frontal regions of the brain. 49,50 In individuals with cerebrovascular disease, white matter hyperintensities in the prefrontal cortex are found to be significantly higher in volume than other regions, suggesting this region may be generally more vulnerable to white matter injury often attributed to small vessel disease. Moreover, there is an extensive network of small blood vessels in subcortical regions, which makes them more susceptible to cerebrovascular injury. 51 Given the extensive connectivity between subcortical and frontal circuits, one hypothesis is that vascular damage in subcortical white matter may disrupt axons involved in regulation of frontal neuronal metabolism. 49 For instance, white matter lesions in subcortical regions have been preferentially associated with frontal cortical hypometabolism, which can lead to cell death. 52,53 Interestingly, other studies have found that regardless of location, white matter injury is specifically associated with functional disruption of frontal networks. For example, specific frontal lobe hypometabolism has been found to relate to both (1) cardiovascular risk in participants with extensive white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts, and (2) white matter lesions regardless of their location in the brain. 24,49,54,55 Further, whole brain cerebrovascular pathology uniquely correlates with cortical atrophy in frontal regions. 565758 Taken together with our findings, systemic cardiovascular health may be most strongly linked to frontal circuitry, including metabolic regulation, cortical structure, and white matter integrity.\nOur findings also highlight the utility of genu integrity as a measure reflecting the effects of cardiovascular disease in the brain, aligning closely with and extending on previous literature. For instance, Raghavan et al. and Vemuri et al. demonstrated that the anterior portion of the corpus callosum is a useful marker for declines in cardiovascular health in adults with mild cognitive impairment and in prodromal disease. 59,60 We extend these findings by examining this association in a large cohort of adults without dementia, and through a wider scope of systemic (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) and vascular outcomes. The genu is a large, easily detected bundle of white matter and therefore may be particularly well positioned as a risk-stratification andor prognostication tool. Our results add to the strong support for utilization of anterior diffusion tensor imaging metrics to track the impact of cardiovascular disease on brain aging in older adults. For instance, our results could be a useful guide for clinicians differentiating between cardiovascular disease and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Clinicians may have greater confidence in cerebrovascular disease pathology as a contributing factor to neurocognitive disorders if both frontal white matter changes and cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) are present.\nGiven that we found support for the genu as a correlate of systemic cardiovascular disease, we explored clinically meaningful correlates via cognition. Our results demonstrate that frontal white matter microstructure (genu) tracks with cognition, namely executive functioning and processing speed. Importantly, we did not find an association between frontal white matter integrity and memory performance, suggesting cognitive specificity of the genu. These findings on anterior diffusion tensor imaging add to existing literature on the association between white matter changes (i.e., white matter hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts) and worsened performance on tests of executive functions and psychomotor speed. 50,61 Moreover, our results align with extant literature that has demonstrated an association between dementia due to cerebrovascular disease and disproportionate declines in executive functioning and processing speed, greater than memory. 626364",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "Our study is not without limitations. With an observational study design, it is difficult to determine whether the examined relationships between regions of the corpus callosum (genu and splenium) and cardiovascular risk are truly due to the impact of cardiovascular health on the brain or reflecting effects of a common parallel process (e.g., general metabolic changes with age). Our cohorts high educational attainment (83 had at least college level education) impacts the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, utilizing a longitudinal design for our study would have provided the opportunity to track whether there are changes in regional specificity of the corpus callosum over time. We also did not explore the effect of potentially confounding factors (e.g., Alzheimers disease pathology) in these relationships, which may have influenced the unexpected relationship between the splenium and systolic blood pressure. Studies that combine white matter neuroimaging with Alzheimers disease biomarkers are needed to disentangle effects of common age-related neuropathologies. Lastly, our study is limited by the lack of inclusion of other imaging markers of white matter integrity in our analyses, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH). It is possible that WMH are a confounding variable in the associations between DTI metrics of the corpus callosum and the outcomes of interest. However, the corpus callosum is a large region of white matter and it may be more robust to differences in the white matter and WMH overall. Future studies should investigate multiple measures of white matter integrity to better understand their impact on diffusion metrics and their relationship to cardiovascular health in a clinically normal population.",

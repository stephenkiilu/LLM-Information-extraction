    "abstract": "White matter (WM) damage has been reported in Alzheimers Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. It is, however, unknown how the investigation of multiple tensor indexes in the same patients, can differentiate them from normal aging or relate to patients cognition. Forty-six individuals (15 healthy, 16 a-MCI and 15 AD) were included. Voxel-based tract based spatial-statistics (TBSS) was used to obtain whole-brain maps of main WM bundles for fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (DR), axial diffusivity (DA) and mean diffusivity (MD). FA reductions were evidenced among AD patients with posterior predominance. A-MCI patients displayed reduced mean FA in these critical regions, compared to healthy elders. MD increases were widespread in both groups of patients. Interestingly, a-MCI patients exhibited DR increases in overlapping areas of FA shrinkages in AD, whereas DA increases were only observed in AD. Gray matter atrophy explained most DTI differences, except those regarding MD in both groups as well as DR increases in posterior associative pathways among a-MCI cases. FA values were the only DTI measure significantly related to memory performance among patients. Present findings suggest that most DTI-derived changes in AD and a-MCI are largely secondary to gray matter atrophy. Notably however, specific DR signal increases in posterior parts of the inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi may reflect early WM compromise in preclinical dementia, which is independent of atrophy. Finally, global measures of integrity, particularly orientation coherence (FA) of diffusion, appear to be more closely related to the cognitive profile of our patients than indexes reflecting water movement parallel (DA) and perpendicular (DR) to the primary diffusion direction.",

      "text": "White matter (WM) damage in Alzheimers disease (AD) has been identified from postmortem (Brun and Englund, 1986;Englund, 1998;Gold et al., 2007;Gouw et al., 2008) and MRI findings including WM signal abnormalities (Gouw et al., 2008;Heo et al., 2009;Yoshita et al., 2006) and volumetric reductions (Balthazar et al., 2009;Li et al., 2008;Salat et al., 2010;Stout et al., 1996). Using neuro-imaging techniques, more precise knowledge of the WM changes contributing to AD is being achieved, especially after the introduction of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which allows investigation of the microstructure and integrity of white matter fiber tracts (Le Bihan et al., 2001;Sundgren et al., 2004). In this regard, many DTI studies of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, Bozzali et al., 2002;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2005Fellgiebel et al., , 2008;;Kantarci et al., 2001;Rose et al., 2006;Xie et al., 2006;Yoshiura et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2007) have focused in fractional anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity indexes (MD). MD can be used as a measure of alterations of brain tissues, whereas FA reflects white matter integrity, being one of the most used indexes derived from MR-DTI acquisitions (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996).\nSeveral factors are implied in FA variation, including myelination, axon density, axonal membrane integrity, axon diameter (Beaulieu, 2002) and intravoxel coherence of fiber orientation (Smith et al., 2007). Thus, for a deeper understanding of WM involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, the use of multiple diffusion tensor measures has been proposed (Alexander et al., 2007). In this regard, recent work has evidenced higher sensibility of radial diffusivity (DR) than axial diffusivity (DA) to reveal the normal process of WM aging (Davis et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2008), because DR has been associated to myelin breakdown (Harsan et al., 2006;Song et al., 2005). In contrast, AD pathology is characterized by WM changes that may be related to the A load (Chalmers et al., 2005) axonal damage and Wallerian degeneration (Alexander et al., 2007;Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Beaulieu, 2002;Chalmers et al., 2005;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Davis et al., 2009;Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Harsan et al., 2006;Huang and Auchus, 2007;Smith et al., 2007;Song et al., 2005;Xie et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2007Zhang et al., , 2008)). DA alterations have been related to these processes in AD with inconsistent findings as regional increases (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2010) or decreases (Huang et al., 2007) of this index have been reported. Moreover, very few studies have investigated DR and DA indexes in the same group of AD patients (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2010) and aged populations (Bennet et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2008). FA and MD indexes can be calculated from the three eigenvalues and thus, they are not independent measures from DR and DA. In fact, the different combinations of changes in axial and radial diffusivities, can result in different, from decreased to increased, FA or MD values. To our knowledge however no investigation has yet studied in MCI if there are specific alterations of the DR and DA indexes using a whole-brain analysis, and how they relate to FA and MD findings. The study of WM integrity as a marker of cognitive and clinical status in these conditions is relevant, because it may be related to clinical progression in MCI (Mielke et al., 2009) and AD (Nakata et al., 2009). Thus, it would be of particular interest to investigate if any of the proposed DTI derived measures is particularly sensitive to detect early WM damage in mild AD and in MCI, as compared with normal elders.\nThe objectives of the present study are threefold: First, to use tract-based spatial statistics procedure (TBSS) comparing whole-brain maps of FA in healthy elders, a-MCI and AD patients. Specifically, as an attempt to provide a more refined understanding of the nature of FA changes, regions showing FA variations among group comparisons will be subsequently investigated by employing multiple diffusion tensor measures (DA, DR, MD). Second, to provide a whole-brain map analyses of DA, DR, MD and FA changes as well as their areas of overlapping in AD and MCI subjects. Finally, to determine the clinical significance of the DTI findings through correlations with neuropsychological evaluations.",

      "text": "Forty-six individuals older than 65 years were prospectively recruited from the Alzheimers disease and other Cognitive Disorders Unit, at the Neurology Service of the Hospital Clinic, in Barcelona. This sample included 15 healthy elders, 16 patients with MCI and 15 AD cases. For the present study, patients with MCI were prospectively selected only if they presented the amnestic form of the disorder (a-MCI), as defined by the fact that their remaining cognitive functions and activities of daily living were within the normal range. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations using the diagnostic procedures employed previously by our group (Rami et al., 2007;Solé-Padullés et al., 2009). Healthy individuals did not meet criteria for dementia and presented no cognitive complaints or performances below Ϫ1.5 SD on any neuropsychological test. Patients with a-MCI reported complaints of memory function and scores below Ϫ1.5 SD on an episodic memory test. Probable AD diagnosis was established by an interdisciplinary clinical committee formed by two neurologists and one neuropsychologist according the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. All AD patients included were in the mild stage of the disease (Global Deterioration Scale ϭ 4). This study was approved by the local ethics committee and appropriate procedures were used concerning human subjects.\nTable 1 lists the neuropsychological tests employed to compare our groups of subjects. For purposes of correlations with the distinct DTI indexes, composite neuropsychological variables tapping the memory, executive, language and visuoperceptive-visuospatial domains were generated. These variables reflect the mean values for each individual of the standardized scores for the neuropsychological tests included in each case, which were the following: the composite memory score included the mean standardized individual scores of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers disease (CERAD) recall of constructional Praxis (Morris et al., 1989), as a visual test, and the Grober and Buschke Free and Cuet Selective Reminding test (Grober and Buschke, 1987) (total free recall and delayed free recall subtests), as a verbal memory test. The second composite score, related with frontal functions, included tests measuring attention, working memory, abstract reasoning and phonemic verbal fluency and it was generated by averaging standardized scores of the digit backwards the symbol search tests, the Similarities test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) WAIS and the Con-trolled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT, 1 min, letters F, A, S) tests (Lezak et al., 2004). The language composite score included the scores of the Boston Naming test and those of the Auditory Comprehension subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE, Goodglass and Kaplan, 1972). Finally, a visuoperceptive-visuospatial variable was generated by computing the mean standardized values of the Incomplete Letters and the Number location tests of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP, Warrington and James, 1991) battery (Table 1).",

      "text": "All subjects were examined on a 3 T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio Tim, Siemens Medical Systems, Germany). Diffusion weighted images were acquired using an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence (30 directions, TR ϭ 5,600 ms, TE ϭ 89 ms, 49 slices; slice thickness ϭ 2 mm, gap ϭ 0.6 mm, FOV ϭ 100 mm, matrix size ϭ 122 ϫ 122). This sequence also provides a T2 weighted volume (B0) which was used to rate cerebrovascular disease based on the eval- uation of white matter hyperintensities. Briefly, a boardcertified neuroradiologist (N.B.) rated all images using the Fazekas scale (Fazekas et al., 1987). The mean and SD Fazekas score scale for all the participants was 1.13, SD: 0.63, all of them with Grades 1-2. Because of this, some WM abnormalities were observed in our sample, probably age-related. Comparing the clinical groups no differences were observed between them (Controls: mean: 1.13, SD: 0.74; a-MCI: 1.06, SD: 0.57, AD: 1.21, SD: 057; F ϭ 0.21, p ϭ 0.81). A high-resolution 3D structural dataset (T1weighted MR-RAGE, TR ϭ 2,300 ms, TE ϭ 2.98 ms; FOV ϭ 100 ϫ 100 cm; matrix size ϭ 256 ϫ 256; Flip angle ϭ 9; Slice thickness ϭ 1) was also acquired to coregister with the DTI data. DTI processing and voxelwise statistical analysis were performed with FSL v4.0 (Smith et al., 2004) at the Neuroimaging Laboratory of the Department of Psychiatry and Clinical Psychobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona. Corrected and registered Diffusion-Weighted images were used to obtain voxel-wise Mean Diffusion (MD) maps and to create a DTI model, including maps of FA, Radial Diffusivity (DR) and Axial Diffusivity (DA), by using the FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox, after correcting the effects of motion and eddy currents, affinining the registration to the reference volume (b0) and applying FSLs Brain Extraction Tool (BET) (Smith et al., 2002).\nTract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS 1.1) (Smith et al., 2006) was used for voxelwise statistical analysis. Nonlinear transform were applied using the FSL registration tool, FNIRT, to obtain FA images aligned to standard space and the resulting images were merged into single 4 D image. FMRIB58-FA standard-space image as target following the recommendations of FSL software guidelines. The mean of all FA images were fed into a skeletonization program obtaining the mean FA skeleton.\nAfter applying the nonlinear transforms we verified that the registration worked properly by checking that each subjects major tracts were well aligned to the relevant parts of the skeleton. Subsequently, the mean FA skeleton was thinned (threshold FA value of 0.25) to identify all the fibber pathways consistent across subjects. Finally, FA data were projected onto the thresholded mean FA skeleton assigning the maximum FA value of the FA image to the skeleton voxel, and obtaining an image which contains the projected skeletonized FA data. TBSS analysis were performed for MD, DR and DA images applying the data of the nonlinear warps, skeletonization stages and the estimation of the projection vectors from FA images as recommended.\nBrain tissue volume, normalized for subject head size, was estimated with SIENAX (Smith et al., 2002), part of FSL (Smith et al., 2004). From these results, we computed the ratio between gray matter (GM) tissue and total brain tissue to obtain a measure of total GM corrected volume per individual.",

Pearsons correlations were performed to investigate relationships between composite cognitive indexes, and areas across the multiple tensor parameters showing group differences. To investigate if GM atrophy influenced DTI results all analyses were repeated by adjusting for GM volumes.\nDTI-based voxelwise statistics were carried out using a simple permutation program (randomize) for nonparametric statistics and a standard GLM design because the distribution of FA values has been suggested to deviate from normality (Jones et al., 2005;Marenco et al., 2006). With this approach, voxelwise differences among groups applying two-sample t tests were assessed. We used the thresholded mean FA skeleton (mean value of 0.25) setting the number of permutation to 5,000 as recommended and the significance threshold at p Ͻ 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons familywise error correction (FWE).",

      "text": "We finally investigated the areas showing overlapping changes in the distinct diffusion indexes. Figure 5 depicts the superimposed maps taking as a reference FA and MD findings and combining the other DTI indexes. While most figures correspond to AD results (i.e., all indexes were affected, Fig. 5A and5B) the overlapping areas of MD and DR among a-MCI are also depicted (Fig. 5C). Regarding AD, it can be observed that most FA reductions were ac- companied by concomitant DR increases (regions depicted in dark blue in Fig. 5A). Thus, this combined map closely overlaps with the areas reflecting isolated FA decreases. In contrast, when we considered the areas that solely exhibited overlaps between FA decrements and DA increments (re-moving regions showing DR changes), only the left uncinate fasciculus emerged (small green areas in Fig. 5A). Finally, when considering areas where reductions in FA coincided with increases in DR, in DA or in both indexes, the picture resembled the one with overlapping of FA and DR but it was clearly reduced in extent (in red in Fig. 5A), mainly affecting left temporal, periventricular regions and the anterior callosum. A similar pattern was observed when studying the combination of MD with DR and DA indexes (Fig. 5B), as the largest overlaps (i.e., approaching the original MD findings) were observed for the conjoint MD and DR increases (regions depicted in dark blue). Again, when areas showing conjoint increases only in MD and DA values the map was clearly reduced to the different segments of the corpus callosum (genum, body and splenium) as well as bilaterally in temporal areas including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi and the temporal segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (areas in green). These latter tracts in the anterior and posterior temporal lobes did also show overlapping increases of the three indexes (MD, DR and DA), as well as all the segments of the corpus callosum as well as the uncinate bundle bilaterally. Finally, for aMCI cases (Fig. 5C) we looked at the overlapping maps of MD and DR, the only two diffusion indexes showing voxelwise differences when compared to healthy elders. Anatomically, the overlapping map revealed a clear similarity with the regions showing DR increases when this index was considered individually, including posterior brain areas bilaterally and in the right temporal lobe (see Fig. 2). However, the spatial extent of the isolated DR map was greater than the areas where both MD and DR showed increases (Fig. 5C), implying that regions of isolated DR increases were observed in this condition.\nFinally we repeated all DTI index comparison among groups after adjusting for GM atrophy. The main findings concerning the MD for both groups and some significant clusters implying increased DR in posterior and temporal areas of the inferior longitudinal and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi were maintained in a-MCI. In contrast, this adjustment had a clear impact on FA, DR and DA results, which were completely affected in AD group. In particular, no significant area of decreased FA or increased DR or DA could be further observed among AD after controlling for GM volume.",

MD was also negatively related to memory performance but the association did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 6).

      "text": "Several main findings emerged from this whole-brain comparison of FA, DR, DA and MD DTI-derived indexes in healthy elders, a-MCI and AD patients. First, regional specific FA decreases among mild AD could be identified. Interestingly, areas showing FA decreases mostly corresponded with radial and mean diffusivity raises, while DA diffusivity changes were less prominent and specific for AD. Second, mean FA reductions among a-MCI were found when selecting WM areas where AD patients exhibited altered FA values, suggesting incipient compromise of WM tracts in critical posterior regions. This was also confirmed by whole brain analyses using the DR metric, where significant DR increments among a-MCI were found in clear Fig. 6. Correlations between regional alterations of distinct DTI indexes in patients and the composite memory scores. For representation purposes the regions in colors for each DTI index reflect the total areas affected in both a-MCI and AD compared to controls. An exception are FA correlations where regions represent decreases among AD, despite a-MCI are also included, as mean FA values in those particular areas were significantly decreased in this group. For DA only correlations for AD are included because no changes for this index were observed among a-MCI. a-MCI: empty circles; AD: triangles.\nanatomical correspondence with regions of DR increases in AD. In addition, MD changes were widespread in both groups. In general, MD changes for both groups and posterior areas exhibiting DR increases among a-MCI were the only diffusion differences that prevailed after adjusting for GM atrophy. Finally, when restricting the analysis to patients, only the FA values were significantly related to memory performance, evidencing that microstructural WM damage as reflected by this commonly used index has a direct correspondence with the predominant cognitive symptoms of these patients.",

      "text": "The reduced FA values observed in AD patients adds further evidence to recent observations using equivalent methodology to process DTI data (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Salat et al., 2010;Stricker et al., 2009). Association fiber pathways such as the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were compromised bilaterally in accordance with recent observations (Fellgiebel et al., 2008), as well as the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Xie et al., 2006). The cingulate bundle was also affected in the left hemisphere, in partial agreement with other findings using distinct methodologies and reporting right hemisphere (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009) or bilateral involvement (Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Xie et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2007). Notably, we found compromise of the uncinate fasciculus among AD but not in MCI patients, which agrees with a former TBBS-based report (Damoiseaux et al., 2009, but see uncorrected voxel-wise TBSS findings from Liu et al., 2009) and a tractography study (Kiuchi et al., 2009), as well as with previous ROI findings in AD (Taoka et al., 2006;Yasmin et al., 2008). This fascicle is a corticocortical bundle connecting the anterior frontal and inferior temporal lobes (Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992;Petrides and Pandya, 1988;Ungerleider et al., 1989), and its affectation probably reflects the critical implication of the temporal lobe in AD pathology (Hanyu et al., 1998). Our study provides novel evidence of the relevance of the involvement of this tract in AD patients by using multiple DTI parameters in the same sample of patients, as it was the only brain area showing FA reductions as well as concomitant DA increases within FA affected regions.\nIn accordance with a previous report using the same voxel-wise approach among a-MCI patients (Damoiseaux et al., 2009), we failed to observe regional differences compared to healthy elders or to AD patients when considering the FA index as a summary measure of white matter integrity. Nonetheless, we could identify a reduction of the mean FA when analyses were restricted to areas in which AD patients exhibited altered FA values. Reductions of FA in particular brain regions among a-MCI are in the line of previous reports (Bai et el, 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2005;Medina et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2007) albeit they were based in ROI ap-proaches based on a priori knowledge of previous literature of WM involvement. Overall, present findings add further evidence indicating that incipient WM damage can be evidenced among a-MCI patients when focusing on brain regions compromised in the early stages of dementia. Finally, both in AD and a-MCI the visualization of the overlapping areas between FA and DR and DA revealed that most reductions of the FA index were mainly explained by changes in the perpendicular direction (DR increases). In contrast, when restricting the TBSS analysis of the principal eigenvector (1, DA) to areas showing FA decreases, only the uncinate fasciculus emerged. Thus, as regards the study of the relationship among distinct diffusion indexes, the clearest overlapping between FA and DR indexes than for FA and DA measures is consistent with a recent TBSS study in aging showing that age-related FA decreases were associated with an age-related increase in DR and to a lesser extend with increases in both DR and DA indexes (Bennet et al., 2009).",

Our findings agree with these observations demonstrating widespread increases in MD and DR in early AD in most areas showing FA shrinkages, but also in more extent anatomical regions when considering whole-brain analyses. In our study, MD increases among AD and a-MCI were not confounded by gray matter atrophy, possibly revealing myelin breakdown relatively independent of the underlying neurodegenerative process, in accordance with observations that MD increases reflect a net loss of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white matter. However, it is also to note that little anatomical specificity can be achieved using this index, as virtually the whole skeleton for both groups was affected. Other studies could evidence more anatomical precision for MD in the enthorinal cortices, occipital, parietal and frontal lobes (Chen et al., 2009;Rose et al., 2006), centrum semiovale, hippocampus and temporal lobe (Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Kantarci et al., 2001) for MCI group; and corpus callosum (Bozzali et al., 2002;Duan et al., 2006), parietal (Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Kantarci et al., 2001), temporal (Bozzali et al., 2002;Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Kantarci et al., 2001) and frontal lobes (Bozzali et al., 2002) in AD. Nonetheless, most studies were focused on ROIs and no former data are available providing MD measures in a-MCI using TBSS. As regards AD, only one study measured MD changes employing this methodology (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009), and results were largely consistent with the ones reported here, observing that MD increases are more extensive than FA decreases in this condition. Overall, the most interesting result of this combined diffusion index study as regards MD and DR is the finding that some areas showing DR increases among a-MCI in critical posterior anatomical areas are relatively independent of GM atrophy. This may indicate some sort of damage related to incipient WM demyelization in these patients, as will be discussed below.",

However, in that study, DA analyses were only restricted to regions showing significant FA reductions. Conversely, we also studied whole-brain differences among groups, identifying regions of DA increases outside FA affected areas, only for AD patients, which is consistent with another recent report observing DA increases using whole-brain TBSS analyses (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009). There is some controversy regarding the interpretation of DA variations in pathological conditions, because both increases and decreases have been described (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009;Duan et al., 2006;Huang and Auchus, 2007;Huang et al., 2007;Salat et al., 2010;Yoshiura et al., 2006). Besides methodological issues, it seems that findings revealing DA decreases are mainly focused on homogeneous parallel fiber tracts, which are not significantly confounded by crossing WM fibers (Smith et al., 2007). In contrast, when the imaging voxels contain crossing fibers, less coherently organized tracts or extracellular fluid increases, an increment in DR could result in an apparent increase in all eigenvalues within a voxel (Charlton et al., 2006) contributing to the reported DA increases. In our study, pathological increments of the DA index among AD are in accordance with recent findings from Salat et al. (2010) and Acosta-Cabronero et al. (2009) comparing AD patients and older adults. In Salat et al. (2010) and in the present report, DA raises were reduced after adjusting for gray matter atrophy, albeit they remained in temporal and parahipocampal cortices in the previous work, while they were completely eliminated in our investigation. These differences are most probably explained by the fact that Salat et al. (2010) specifically adjusted for hippocampal volume while we used whole gray matter volume correction.",

    "Possible mechanisms underlying multiple DTI index abnormalities in AD and MCI": {
      "text": "The interpretation of water diffusion data are complex, especially in regions showing changes in different DTI indexes in which it is not entirely clear if the same mechanism underlies these changes. However, based on the previous literature, two principal and possibly coexistent mechanisms have been considered to account for DTI findings in aging and dementia. First, WM changes may be directly related to the neurodegenerative process. This possibility would suggest axonal damage related to Wallerian degeneration as the putative primary mechanism of WM change in AD (Alexander et al., 2007;Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Beaulieu, 2002;Chalmers et al., 2005;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Davis et al., 2009;Duan et al., 2006;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Harsan et al., 2006;Huang and Auchus, 2007;Smith et al., 2007;Song et al., 2005;Xie et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2007Zhang et al., , 2008)). Second, myelin damage is a contributing factor for the pathology of both normal aging and AD, including the preclinical stages of the disease (Bartzokis, 2004), and has been related to A oligomerization (Bartzokis et al., 2007). In this regard, it has been proposed that the myelin sheath is the primary lesion site in normal aging and demented patients (Wallin et al., 1989). A conceptualization of the predominant myelin process explaining WM compromise in AD is considered in the retrogenesis model, where late-myelinating association fiber pathways are mainly compromised in initial stages of the disease, compared with early-myelinating fibers (Stricker et al., 2009).\nIn the present study and as regards AD patients, our findings clearly support that WM changes are intimately related to brain atrophy, as most differences between healthy elders and AD were no further significant after adjusting for whole GM volumes. Of note however, is the fact that WM compromise impacted mainly association (i.e., uncinate), limbic (cingulum) and commissural pathways (splenium of the corpus callosum), in accordance with the topography predicted by the retrogenesis hypothesis. Hence, to a lesser extent, the existence of some WM damage reflecting mainly myelin breakdown rather than Wallerian degeneration secondary to distal GM atrophy cannot be excluded, and this is probably reflected by MD increases in our study. Overall however, it should be emphasized that considering all the remaining diffusion measures, our findings in AD are compatible with the view that a concomitant impairment of gray and white matter is directly related to the neurodegenerative process that is at work in these patients. Thus, our results are in concordance with recent conclusions relating multiple DTI index alterations with specific degeneration of neuronal networks in AD (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2009). Further, despite the fact that we did not restrict our GM volume correction to particular areas, the present results fit conceptually with a recent report employing a WM parcellation procedure, showing a corre-spondence between subcortical WM damage adjacent to areas frequently exhibiting cortical degeneration in AD (Salat et al., 2009).\nAs in AD, results regarding FA reductions in our a-MCI group (restricted to AD-related WM pathological regions) were also highly dependent on GM atrophy characteristics, suggesting that previous DTI findings revealing decreased values of this commonly used index in this condition reflect axonal damage, probably related to the underlying neurodegenerative process. The most novel results in this sample however emerged when considering increases perpendicular to the main eigenvector (DR). Importantly, and despite DR increases showed substantial anatomical correspondence between clusters showing significant FA reductions in AD, some of the DR alterations in the posterior parts of the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fiber pathways were not influenced by GM atrophy. In the previous literature, radial diffusivity alterations have been reported in models of dysmyelination (Tyszka et al., 2006) and demyelination, and associated to myelin breakdown (Harsan et al., 2006;Song et al., 2005). As the fiber tracts presenting significant DR increases in the a-MCI group correspond to late myelinating pathways, the fact that some of these areas remained after adjusting for GM may be partially supporting the retrogenesis model, and thus reveal areas of incipient WM compromise in the condition. Notwithstanding, it is also important to note that some of these pathways connect medial temporal and frontal lobe structures (i.e., inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; Martino et al., 2009), which are progressively affected in terms of neocortical atrophy in MCI as the level of clinical impairment increases to early AD (McDonald et al., 2009). Overall thus, these observations suggest the possible coexistence in MCI of nearby WM regions reflecting both damage mainly related to myelin compromise as well as evidences of axonal damage secondary to atrophy in temporal structures principally.\nIn summary, the present results combining distinct DTI indexes provide evidence that, except for MD measures in both groups and specific DR increases in a-MCI, most WM changes are directly related to the underlying GM atrophy. In the preclinical stage of dementia the information provided by the DR maps may be useful in differentiating WM compromise in critical posterior regions not related to GM atrophy, possibly providing earlier information than FA alterations in the course of the disease.",

    "Correlations between DTI findings and cognitive performance": {
      "text": "In our study, areas of WM compromise in a-MCI and AD patients revealed significant correlations with composite scores of memory performance, but only when considering the FA index. The frontal, language and visuospatialvisuoperceptive composite scores did not show any correlation, indicating that FA alterations are related to a cognitive area profoundly impaired in our patients but not to those exhibiting milder dysfunctions (i.e., frontal lobe, language and visuospatial-visuoperceptive functions in AD) or normal performance (these cognitive domains in a-MCI patients). Previous studies mainly focusing on FA andor MD values in normal aging (Charlton et al., 2006;Grieve et al., 2007;Schiavone et al., 2009;Sullivan et al., 2008;Zahr et al., 2009) MCI and AD populations (Bai et al., 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2005Fellgiebel et al., , 2008;;Huang and Auchus, 2007;Rose et al., 2006;Walhovd et al., 2009;Xie et al., 2005) reported associations in the same direction (positive for FA and negative for MD) with cognitive performance. The fact that we observed correlations in the expected direction for the MD values but that they did not reach statistical significance may be related to reduced statistical power associated with relatively small samples, as they became significant when adding healthy elders in the analyses. However, it should be noted that to detect an specific association between WM damage and cognitive functions directly linked to brain pathology, the increased samples should particularly involve patient groups and include within group correlations. For the other indexes, DR and DA, significant associations were revealed also observed when collapsing all groups, but correlations were much more clearly reduced compared to MD when only considering patients. This observation may indicate that while the study of DTI indexes reflecting water movement parallel and perpendicular to the primary diffusion direction is useful to differentiate patterns of WM compromise in AD and a-MCI, the association of WM status and clinical profile is best attained when considering global measures of integrity, as the average rate (MD) and orientation coherence (FA) of diffusion.\nSeveral limitations of the study should be considered in the interpretation of the results. First, our sample included a reduced number of healthy elders and patients and thus, replication in independent and larger groups is necessary. Second, we used one of the available approaches to process DTI images (i.e., TBSS). Despite it has been reported to circumvent some of the issues of misalignment, partial voluming and smoothing of data (Smith et al., 2006) compared with the conventional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach (Ashburner and Friston, 2001), we cannot rule out the putative artifacts derived from intensive computer processing of the data. Additionally, the use of the T2 weighted volume (B0) to exclude evidence of cerebrovascular disease is a clear limitation due to the low spatial resolution of these images. Hence, despite none of our cases showed important WM damage according to basic ratings and groups did not differ in this variable, it is clearly acknowledged that use of B0 volumes to exclude cerebrovascular damage needs to be improved in further studies by using other images of higher quality for these purposes. Finally, variables previously associated with white matter integrity such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus or other vascular risk factors which could have influenced our results were not statistically controlled in this study.",

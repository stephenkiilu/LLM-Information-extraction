    "abstract": "The causes of the neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimers disease (AD) are not completely known. Recent studies have shown that white matter (WM) damage could be more severe and widespread than whole-brain cortical atrophy and that such damage may appear even before the damage to the gray matter (GM). In AD, Amyloid-beta (Aβ 42 ) and tau proteins could directly affect WM, spreading across brain networks. Since hippocampal atrophy is common in the early phase of disease, it is reasonable to expect that hippocampal volume (HV) might be also related to WM integrity. Our study aimed to evaluate the integrity of the whole-brain WM, through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters, in mild AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to AD (with Aβ 42 alteration in cerebrospinal fluid CSF) in relation to controls; and possible correlations between those measures and the CSF levels of Aβ 42 , phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) and total tau (t-Tau). We found a widespread WM alteration in the groups, and we also observed correlations between p-Tau and t-Tau with tracts directly linked to mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (fornix and hippocampal cingulum). However, linear regressions showed that the HV better explained the variation found in the DTI measures (with weak to moderate effect sizes, explaining from 9 to 31) than did CSF proteins. In conclusion, we found widespread alterations in WM integrity, particularly in regions commonly affected by the disease in our group of early-stage disease and patients with Alzheimers disease. Nonetheless, in the statistical models, the HV better predicted the integrity of the MTL tracts than the biomarkers in CSF.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly population. According to United Nations, the number of older people in less developed regions has grown considerably, and projections indicate that 1.7 billion people aged 60 years or over will live in these regions by 2050 (Burla et al., 2013;Reitz et al., 2011). According to World Health Organization (WHO, 2022), the global prevalence of dementia has been estimated to be as high as 55 million and it is predicted to double until 2040 (United Nations, Department of Economic  Social Affairs, Population Division, 2015).\nThe causes of the AD neurodegenerative process are not completely known and involve different mechanisms in the pathogenesis. Although remarkable pathological characteristics have already been identified\nand used as biomarkers, especially regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nproteins -(Amyloid-beta Aβ 42  peptide, phosphorylated tau p-Tau protein, and total tau t-Tau) (WHO, 2022), other characteristics are yet to be determined as useful biomarkers. Some of these biomarkers can be accessed through neuroimaging analysis.\nAD is classically considered a gray matter (GM) disease that starts in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. The transentorhinal cortex is one of the first affected areas and then the changes spread to limbic and neocortical regions. Hippocampal atrophy is also a very distinctive biomarker of the disease, but not exclusive (Braak et al., 1999).\nRecent studies have shown that white matter (WM) damage could be more severe and widespread than whole-brain cortical atrophy (Falgàs et al., 2019). Some authors state that WM damage can be detected before the beginning of cortical atrophy and overt dementia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and even in cognitive impaired elders (Falgàs et al., 2019;Stone et al., 2021) or even in asymptomatic stages (Amlien  Fjell, 2014).\nAlthough the WM alterations in the AD spectrum has been reported, little is known regarding their etiology and relationship with Amyloid and tau proteins. One of the hypotheses that relates damage to WM is that the propagation pattern of misfolded proteins via interconnected neural networks in a prion-like mechanism could directly damage WM (Van Schependom et al., 2018). The Aβ peptide andor tau protein might spread across brain networks through WM tracts that connect remote regions of those networks (Chen et al., 2018;Colin et al., 2020). This proliferation of abnormal proteins could then lead to the progressive neuronal death.\nStudies that approach the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis and its WM integrity parameters showed several changes in AD (Vaquer-Alicea  Diamond, 2019). These diffusivity parameters indicate axonal injuries and are increased in the disease. Radial diffusivity (RD) is more sensitive to changes in axon diameter and density: high RD values indicate a smaller thickness of the myelin sheath. The axial diffusivity (AxD) represents the maximum direction of diffusion and gives a primary estimate of the direction of the fiber (Falgàs et al., 2019;Stone et al., 2021). On the other hand, for the fractional anisotropy (FA) measure, the higher this parameter, the more preserved the tract is. And in AD, FA is usually reduced (Falgàs et al., 2019;Stone et al., 2021;Vaquer-Alicea  Diamond, 2019).\nThe DTI parameters could be related to CSF proteins, explaining the spread pattern and alterations as mentioned above (Kantarci et al., 2017;Vaquer-Alicea  Diamond, 2019). However, since hippocampal volumetric atrophy is observed in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and in the pathological process of the disease, it is reasonable to expect that those alterations might be influencing these interactions between CSF protein and WM (Kantarci et al., 2017;Knopman et al., 2018).\nAs the association between AD biomarkers and WM integrity",

All participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation, recently described in Magalhães et al. (2021), performed by an experienced neuropsychologist, and MRI exam (Anderson et al., 2012).\nThe diagnosis of probable dementia due to AD fulfilled the criteria defined by the National Institute of Aging and Alzheimers Association (NIAAA) (Magalhães et al., 2021) and all AD patients had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (McKhann et al., 2011) score of 0.5 or 1. Patients with aMCI were diagnosed using the core criteria of the NIAAA for MCI-CDR score of 0.5 (Morris, 1993) (Albert et al., 2011), and their structural images were characterized by the absence of abnormalities. The control subjects had neither memory complaints nor neurological deficits, and they presented a CDR score of zero.\nExclusion criteria for all subjects included the following: other neurological or psychiatric diseases or having suffered a head trauma that resulted in a loss of consciousness, drug or alcohol addiction, use of sedative drugs 24 h before neuropsychological evaluation, prior chronic exposure to neurotoxic substances, Fazekas score 1, and a\nHachinski ischemic score 4 (Brucki et al., 2003).\nPre-diagnostic procedures also included laboratory tests including Vitamin B12, folate, syphilis serology, and thyroid hormones.\nRegarding the influence of vascular effects, all individuals of this study were normal for age concerning WM hyperintensities on MRI, presenting Fazekas scale 0 or 1.",

      "text": "To assess the WM microstructural abnormalities, we employed the MRICloud (www.MRICloud.org), a recently developed web-based tool to perform automated segmentation and quantification of multiple MRI modalities. MriCloud provides a platform to characterize anatomy (using T1 high resolution weighted images for volumetric analysis), WM (using diffusion tensor images DTI), and resting state functional connectivity, based on the structure-based analysis (Magalhaes et al., 2018). In terms of reproducibility, MRICloud showed high indexes, especially to the DTI pipeline, revealing that such methodology is a reasonably stable tool (Mori et al., 2016). Indeed, anatomical heterogeneity can insert errors into the registration between each patient images and the parcellation atlases. To correct this problem, MRICloud uses a database of atlases obtained from brains with heterogeneous anatomy. Therefore, some atlases would be anatomically closer to the patient than other atlases, providing a high level of parcellation accuracy (Rezende et al., 2019). Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, MRICloud is the only automated pipeline available for whole-brain DTI providing almost 200 anatomical structures.\nThis technique is based on the probabilistic determination of the water molecule diffusion in the tissue, helping to quantify the integrity of the brain tracts (Tang et al., 2014). To extract the main diffusion indices, we used an automated segmentation based on multiple labeled atlases approach, which is a more detailed and refined examination that can assess thinner and smaller tracts. It enables the analysis of alterations that may be more subtle in early stages of the disease.\nTo accomplish that, initially the images were corrected for eddy currents and co-registered using a 12-parameter affine transform (Faria et al., 2010;Woods et al., 1998) to remove subject motion. The images were skull-stripped using the b  0 image by intensity threshold approach, which is implemented at the RoiEditor software (Li, X.; Jiang, H.; Yue, L.; and Mori, S.; Johns Hopkins University, www.MriStudio.\norgorwww.kennedykrieger.org).\nThe DTI-maps are calculated using a multivariate linear fitting as implemented in the DTIStudio software (Jiang, H. and Mori, S., Johns Hopkins University, Kennedy Krieger Institute). Before performing the parcellation, which employs the diffeomorphic likelihood fusion algorithm (DLFA) algorithm, the images are registered to the atlases using the multi-contrast large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithm (Zhuang et al., 2006).\nWe then obtained the main diffusion parameters (FA, mean diffusivity MD, RD, and AxD) and the volume for each label. Analyzing more than one measure allows us to consistently assess whether in fact there is any WM alteration. All analyses are performed in native space.",

      "text": "The processing described above provided FA, AxD, MD, and RD metrics for 64 WM tracts (described in Table S1). Thus, to avoid overfitting and reduce the number of comparisons, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the regions of interest (ROIs) that have contributed the most to WM variability in our sample. Those results guided the selection of variables to perform group comparisons in a data-driven approach.\nWe performed separated PCAs on WM tracts data, one for each DTI parameter including all participants (controls and patients), as mentioned above, and the purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the ROIs that have contributed the most to WM variability, and multicollinearity was tested. Thus, we could preserve statistical power while avoiding bias by selecting ROIs that would be associated to a specific group already a priori. Both Keisers and Catells criteria were applied to extract factors.\nAfter extraction, components were rotated using the nonorthogonal direct oblimin method. Sample size and model adequacy were evaluated using Barletts test of sphericity and the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure. To ensure inclusion of relevant ROIs, we selected within the main components those ROIs with loadings 0.7\n(meaning a strong relationship contributing with at least 64 of variability contribution in the component) to perform hypothesis testing (described in Table S2).\nAll PCAs showed a KMO 0.883, suggesting an appropriate adjustment to the data. Analysis of both Kaisers and Catells criteria suggested that the variability was concentrated on the first two components. We then repeated the analysis extracting only a fixed number of two components explaining a total variance of 40 for FA, 47 for AxD, 55 for MD, and 54 RD. We then selected those WM ROIs with loading factors 0.7 in the subsequent analysis.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In the present study, we first evaluated whole-brain differences in WM microstructural integrity in the AD continuum (aMCI with altered Aβ 42 levels in CSF and mild AD patients) and controls. Our results showed a spread of WM alterations. We observed differences in several different regions, not only in the MTL. The integrity of tracts of the corpus callosum, corona radiata and thalamus are different between groups according to diffusivity measurements, indicating that the aMCI and mild AD groups presented more WM alterations than the control group.\nWe also verified if tau and Aβ 42 could be related with WM microstructure in different tracts throughout the brain, not only in regions that are classically involved with AD. We hypothesized that significant correlations with tracts anatomically and functionally far from more well-established atrophic regions, that is, regions involving the MTL, would support a more direct effect of the pathological AD proteins on WM (Sabuncu et al., 2010;Soldan et al., 2020). By the other hand, alterations found close to regions like hippocampus would imply different pathological mechanisms, like Wallerian degeneration. We did not find significant results regarding Aβ 42 levels and DTI parameters, but we observed correlations of t-Tau and p-Tau protein with measures of FA, AxD, and MD, in the right fornix and right hippocampal-cingulum tracts (Figure 4). However, through regression analysis, only HV remained as significant explanatory variable of CSF biomarkers.\nThe pattern of WM disruption in early stages of AD could initially take place in limbic and commissural tracts and, later, may progress to the projection and association fibers (Falgàs et al., 2019). Recent studies have demonstrated the mechanism through which tau pathology initially progresses from distal axons to proximal dendrites, leading to synaptic disconnection of late myelination fibers (Colin et al., 2020;Racine et al., 2014). Tau has been revealed to be more than a stabilizer of microtubules, playing a role in a variety of biological processes, such as myelination, neurogenesis, motor function, learning, and memory (Fiock et al., 2020;Gold et al., 2014).\nAbnormal tau protein has the property to aggregate with normal tau in endosomes, where they form fibrillar seeds. These fibrils are released from neurons, and spread pathology, resulting in an unstoppable neurodegenerative process in the brain of patients with AD (Asai et al., 2015). Even the process of tau protein hyperphosphorylation can also result in the degradation of axonal cytoskeleton proteins and subsequent loss of axon fibers (Michel et al., 2014).\nConsidering that tau is one of the main drug targets in AD, studies focusing on tau accumulation and dissemination modifiers are extremely important. Several tau-positron emission tomography (PET) studies corroborate that tau pathology might spread through neuronal communication pathways, supporting the idea of trans-synaptic transmission of misfolded tau in AD (Takeda et al., 2015;Vogel et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, this process seems to be accelerated by regional Aβ pathology (Franzmeier et al., 2020;Takeda et al., 2015), and our individuals with aMCI have pathophysiological evidence of Aβ 42 dysfunction.\nLongitudinal tau-PET studies confirm that neocortical tau accumulation occurs almost exclusively in Aβ-positive individuals (Jacobs et al., 2018;Pontecorvo et al., 2019). It is also possible that early Aβ pathology may trigger downstream events (e.g., spread of neocortical tau pathology), where the latter eventually becomes independent of the initiating event (Sanchez et al., 2021).\nBesides, faster tau accumulation is associated not only with higher baseline tau and Aβ load but also with female sex and younger onset of AD (Karran et al., 2011). Although in our results we did not observe differences in terms of sex between the subjects, it is possible to notice a greater number of females in our study.\nIt is worth mentioning that our study did not investigate this accumulation of tau protein. We found relationships of CSF tau proteins levels with WM integrity measures, but only in MTL tracts. As already known, AD has been primarily considered a GM disease, with secondary WM disruption due to Wallerian degeneration (Knopman et al., 2018;Smith et al., 2020). In view of this, we chose to verify if there were correlations with the values of HV.\nThrough regression analysis, only HV remained a significant explanatory variable of CSF biomarkers. The HV better explained the variation found in the DTI measures (with weak to moderate effect sizes, explaining from 9 to 31) than did CSF proteins. These findings provide evidence that hippocampal alterations remain a strong predictor of both tau deposition and WM changes.\nWe understand that the present study has some limitations. The absence of PET scan as an approach to analyze tau and amyloid could be a limitation, although CSF analyses can be very sensitive to detect AD pathophysiology. In fact, CSF alterations are, at least presently, the first alteration that can be observed in the disease process (Brueggen et al., 2019). The lack of information on AD biomarkers in the control group makes it difficult to understand if the proteins related to AD affect WM even before the appearance of any symptoms of the disease.\nHowever, our study presents patients with aMCI due to continuum AD, who show the pathological markers of the disease and can better help to understanding the progression of AD.\nFor DTI analyses, the multi-atlas segmentation used in this study is a refined analytical tool able to access thinner and smaller tract that could be altered even in early stages of the disease. And, as already pointed out, it is a validated method that allows us to robustly analyze changes in early disease stages.\nWe also understand that the cross-sectional nature and its correlational approach do not allow causal inference. For this, regression analysis could offer a better understanding of the hippocampal volume role in our results. It is noteworthy that there are few studies in Latin America involving such richness of details and the combination of different biomarkers. Therefore, our findings can help better clarify the neurodegenerative process in our population.\nIn conclusion, we found widespread alterations in WM integrity even in the earliest disease phase (MCI with altered amyloid). Also, HV better predicted MTL tracts integrity than did CSF biomarkers, what favors the hypothesis of WM disruption due to Wallerian degeneration.",

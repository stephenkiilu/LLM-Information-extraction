    "abstract": "Purpose. The aim of this study was to determine diffusion abnormalities in the posterior cingulate fi ber tracts (PCFTs) in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Materials and methods. We studied 23 AD patients and 18 age-matched normal controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of PCFTs was generated from DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in co-registered voxels along with DTT of PCFTs. Students t-test was used to compare results between the AD patients and normal controls. Results. The MD in PCFTs was signifi cantly higher in AD patients than in normal controls (P  0.019). The FA in PCFTs was signifi cantly lower in AD patients than in normal controls (P  0.007). Conclusion. The abnormal MD increase and FA decrease, which is considered to indicate a net loss of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white matter, is consistent with neuropathological data that demonstrate partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendrial cells in white matter of AD brains. Our results suggest that MD and FA refl ect progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the PCFTs and may represent a useful biological index for monitoring AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia, causing progressive declines in memory, language, and visuospatial abilities. Although AD is generally considered to affect mainly cortical gray matter, pathological changes are also seen in white matter, such as a loss of axons and oligodendrocytes together with reactive astrocytosis. 1 Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive technique that can identify white matter tracts by evaluating the bulk diffusion of water in three dimensions. Diffusion tensor-derived parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) can thus describe the microarchitectural characteristics of local brain tissue (i.e., the conditions of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white matter).\nMapping these parameters enables depiction of pathological changes in cerebral white matter. 2 Several recent reports have shown that mapping diffusion parameters is potentially useful when speculating on the pathology of AD. 3456789101112131415161718192021 The posterior cingulum is an important part of the Papez circuit, which subsumes necessary neural substrates of episodic memory. Posterior cingulate fi ber tracts (PCFTs) connect the anterior thalamus, cortical cingulum, association cortices, and hippocampus. 22 Furthermore, neuropathological studies have revealed early and severe cortical degeneration in the posterior cingulum in patients with AD. 23 The present study examined diffusion abnormalities in the PCFTs in patients with AD in comparison with normal controls. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) generated from DTI was used to measure diffusion abnormalities in the PCFTs.",

      "text": "Our local ethics committee approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.\nFrom March 2005 to January 2006, patients with chief complaints of dementia underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in our institution. After assessment by psychiatrists, patients who were diagnosed with probable AD based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorder Association 24 were involved in this study. Patients presenting with head trauma were excluded, as were those with major systemic, psychiatric, and other neurological illness. Also excluded were patients with significant cerebrovascular disease (cortical infarction, multiple lacunar lesions, leukoaraiosis, or other lesions above Fazekas grade 1 25 ) as well as those with an unsatisfactory DTI study due to artifacts originating from patient motion or metallic dental prostheses. Overall, 23 patients (10 men, 13 women; mean age 72.0  8.1 years, range 55-81 years) met the criteria and were enrolled as subjects in this study.\nAlso recruited were 18 age-matched healthy normal controls (5 men, 13 women; mean age 69.4  4.7 years, range 63-80 years) who did not have any neurological or psychiatric conditions, had no cognitive complaints, had a normal neurological examination, and were not taking any antipsychotic medications. No statistically signifi cant difference in mean age was found between the patients with AD and the normal control group (Students t-test, P  0.22).\nThe cognitive status of each participant was evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the Department of Psychiatry. The mean MMSE score was 21.9  4.0 (range 12-29) for patients with AD and 28.8  1.2 (range 26-30) for normal controls.",

    "MRI acquisition": {
      "text": "All scans were performed using a 1.0-T MRI system (Magnetom Harmony; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard head coil. Regular structural images such as T1-weighted spin echo images, T2-weighted turbo-spin echo images, and fl uid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were obtained prior to DTI acquisition. DTI was performed using the spin-echo echo-planar technique (TRTE 8400113 ms, matrix size 128  128, fi eld of view (FOV) 230  230 mm 2 , slice thickness 3 mm with no gap). Images were obtained with both 12-directional diffusion-encoding (b  700 smm 2 for each direction) and no diffusion encoding (b  0 smm 2 ). To ensure high data reliability, a high signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by averaging images six times. A total of 40 axial section images were obtained, covering the whole cerebrum. Scanning time for DTI was 11 min 7 s. Total scan time for all MRI was approximately 20 min. DTI data postprocessing DTI data were transferred to an offl ine workstation. Analysis was performed using dTV II and VOLUME-ONE 1.72 developed by Masutani et al. 26 (http:www. ut-radiology.umin.ac.jppeoplemasutanidTV.htm) running under Windows XP Professional. Interpolation along the Z-axis was performed to obtain isotropic data (voxel size 1.8  1.8  1.8 mm 3 ).\nUsing 13 sets of images (12 sets of images with b  700 smm 2 , 1 set of images with b  0 smm 2 ), colorcoded maps were created. In axial, coronal, and sagittal slices, green was assigned to anteroposterior, red to leftright, and blue to craniocaudal directions. 27 Color coding of fi ber orientation enabled ready identifi cation of major white matter tracts by comparison with previous published data regarding DTI of white matter association pathways. 28 Diffusion tensor tractography of cingulate fi ber tracts was performed from the seed region-of-interest (seed ROI) in the posterior part of the cingulate fi ber tracts to the target ROI in the middle part of the cingulate fi ber tracts. Color-coded maps were displayed to enable the precise and objective placement of these ROIs into the cingulate fi ber tracts. A reconstructed sagittal section of the color-coded map was used to determine reconstructed coronal sections at the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum and the center of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1A). The cingulate fi ber tracts were displayed as green in the coronal slices. The relatively large seed ROIs, including the entirety of the cingulate fi ber tracts, were placed manually on a reconstructed coronal section of the color maps at the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum in the sagittal plane (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the relatively large target ROI, including the entirety of the cingulate fi ber tracts, was placed manually on a reconstructed coronal section of the color maps at the level of the center of the corpus callosum in the sagittal plane (Fig. 1C). DTT of cingulate fi ber tracts was then generated (Fig. 1D). We used the threshold values of line-tracking termination as FA  0.18 for the following two reasons. (1) To the best of our knowledge, DTT of the cingulate fi ber tracts in adult healthy volunteers was generated with the threshold values of line-tracking termination as FA  0.15, 0.18, 0.20, or 0.30 in previous studies. 29303132333435 (2) Kunimatsu et al. found that an FA value of around 0.20 was the optimal trackability threshold of FA for accurate and effi cient DTT of the corticospinal tract. They also expected that this FA threshold would be widely applicable to DTT of other tracts. 36 The trackline voxelization function of the dTV II software voxelizes the tracking line of the white matter tract with the original tensor parameters. In this present study, PCFTs were defi ned as the cingulate fi ber tracts between the seed ROI and the target ROI. Voxelization along the PCFT between the seed ROI and the target ROI was performed (Fig. 1E), and MD and FA values in coregistered voxels were calculated.",

      "text": "Measurements were performed by two of the authors (Y.N., S.S.), who were blinded to the disease status of the subjects. Interobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coeffi cient) at the measurement of patients with AD was r  0.99 for measured MD and r  0.96 for measured FA. Interobserver reliability at the measurement of normal controls was r  0.98 for measured MD and r  0.93 for measured FA. Averaged MD and FA values were thus used for analysis.\nStatistical analyses were performed using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). MD and FA values measured in the right and left PCFTs were compared using paired t-tests; averaged MD and FA values of the right and left PCFT were used. Students t-test was used to compare the averaged MD and FA between patients with AD and normal controls. P  0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi cance.\nPrevious reports have shown signifi cant age-related increases in the apparent diffusion coeffi cient (ADC) and decreases in FA in the cerebral white matter. 37,38 Taking into account the effects of age, the partial correlation matrix between the measured MD and FA and age were calculated using bivariate correlation analysis (Pearsons r) for both the patients with AD and the normal controls.",

For measured FA and MD values of the PCFTs, no signifi cant correlation with age was identifi ed (P  0.05) in either patients with AD or normal controls.\nFor patients with AD, the mean MD of PCFTs was 0.639  0.042  10 -3 mm 2 s, and the mean FA of the PCFTs was 0.461  0.037.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study investigated for the fi rst time DTI measurement of the posterior cingulum in AD patients in comparison with normal controls using the diffusion tensor tract-specifi c analyses, which are more precise and sophisticated methods than those used in previous studies. Measured MD in PCFTs was signifi cantly higher in patients with AD than that in normal controls. Measured FA in PCFTs was signifi cantly lower in patients with AD than that in normal controls. These results suggest that MD and FA refl ect progression of ADrelated histopathological changes, such as partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendrial cells in the PCFTs and may represent a useful biological index for monitoring AD.\nTo the best of our knowledge, few previous studies have used color-coded maps, 345 They found that the tract-specifi c method tended to show statistically signifi cant differences more clearly than the ROI method because instabilities of placing ROIs in anatomical structures directly result in instability of the measured value with this method. 41 Because the white matter tracts of interest were segmented by DTT and the portion of segmented tract was evaluated selectively, our methods may be more sensitive than methods that use other anatomical landmarks. 40 Pathological changes in AD are characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofi brillary tangles along with neuronal loss that produces cerebral atrophy. These pathological changes originate in the mediotemporal region (the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus), subsequently spreading over the entire limbic cortex and then into neocortical association areas, resulting in progressive cognitive decline. 42 Based on the course of the hippocampal fi bers, it is possible to divide the intrahippocampal circuitry into two pathways: the polysynaptic pathway and the direct pathway. The principal outputs of the polysynaptic pathway to the cortex follow the body and columns of the fornix. The nervous impulses then reach the anterior thalamic nucleus. From the anterior thalamic nucleus, impulses mainly reach the studies had used DTT to calculate diffusion tensor metrics in AD patients. 678 Xie et al. measured FA in the entire cingulate bundles and hippocampal volumes. They found that AD patients showed a signifi cant reduction of FA and hippocampal volumes relative to normal controls, and that there was a signifi cant correlation between FA values and hippocampal volumes and MMSE scores. 6 Taoka et al. measured MD, FA, and the number of voxels along the tracts of interest in the uncinate fasciculus, inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and Meyers loop. They found that FA in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus and left inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus were signifi cantly lower for AD patients than for normal controls and that MD in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus was signifi cantly greater for AD patients than for normal controls. They also found that there was no signifi cant difference in either FA or MD along Meyers loop or in the number of voxels included in all constructed tracts between the two groups. 7 Yasmin et al. measured MD and FA in the uncinate fasciculus. They found that FA was significantly lower for AD patients than for normal controls and that there was no signifi cant difference in MD between the two groups. 8 Tract-specifi c analysis using DTT is one of the most promising imaging processing techniques, as it enables both visualization of the fi ber pathways in the brain and quantitative analysis of specifi c fi ber bundles. 39,40 In the present study, DTT enabled clear identifi cation of PCFTs and more precise measurement of diffusion parameters than a simple manually drawn ROI study; these benefi ts were obtained because the method avoided contamination of data by adjacent posterior cingulate cortex and the retrosplenial cortex. 22 Among these tracts, PCFTs are easily visualized and are suitable for the analysis by DTT generated from DTI. Furthermore, neuropathological studies have revealed early, severe cortical degeneration in the posterior cingulum in AD patients. 23 Several functional neuroimaging studies have shown metabolic abnormalities in the posterior cingulum associated with early AD. 43,44 Metabolic and blood fl ow abnormalities in the posterior cingulum reportedly correlate with the severity of cognitive dysfunction. 45,46 In several previous studies, degeneration or metabolicblood fl ow abnormalities in the cortex and DTI abnormalities in the white matter tracts that connect the affected cortex have been reported in some neuropsychological diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia). 40,47,48 In these neuropsychological diseases, the degree of anisotropy and diffusivity were considered to be somewhat linked to the quality and density of oriented structures in the tissue; however, the exact mechanism for diffusion anisotropy or diffusivity are not well understood.",

      "text": "Many studies report the investigation of white matter abnormalities in AD patients using DTI in regions that including the hippocampus, temporal stem, splenium, posterior cingulum, and occipital and parietal white matter. 3456789101112131415161718192021 Our results support the results of these previous studies. The abnormal ADC increase and FA decrease in the white matter of AD brains, which is thought to indicate a net loss of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white matter in patients with AD, is consistent with neuropathological data that demonstrate partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendrial cells in white matter. 1 It has been speculated that the abnormal increase in ADC and decrease in FA in the white matter of AD brains are related to Wallerian degeneration in the cerebral cortex. 49 Signifi cant differences in MD and FA in PCFTs between patients with AD and normal controls are consistent with the results of previous pathological and neuroimaging studies. Although the exact mechanisms for diffusion anisotropy or diffusivity are not well understood, the DTI abnormalities in PCFTs in AD patients were considered to be somewhat linked to the metabolic and blood fl ow abnormalities in the posterior cingulum, which reportedly correlate with the severity of the cognitive dysfunction. Our results suggest that a diffusion abnormality in PCFTs may represent a useful biological index for monitoring AD.\nThe limitations of the present study include the DTI images obtained using a 1.0 T MRI system, the relatively small number of participants, the heterogeneously distributed MMSE scores in AD patients, and the possibil-ity of including mild cognitive impairment patients. Nowadays, research investigations involving quantitative MRI techniques are usually performed on scanners operated at strong magnetic fi elds (1.5 or 3.0 T). Future studies should therefore include a larger number of participants using high-fi eld MRI systems.",

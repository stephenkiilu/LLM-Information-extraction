    "abstract": "Our goal was to understand the complex relationship between age, sex, midlife risk factors, and early white matter changes measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their role in the evolution of longitudinal white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We identified 1564 participants (1396 cognitively unimpaired, 151 mild cognitive impairment and 17 dementia participants) with age ranges of 30-90 years from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We used computational causal structure discovery and regression analyses to evaluate the predictors of WMH and DTI, and to ascertain the mediating effect of DTI on WMH. We further derived causal graphs to understand the complex interrelationships between midlife protective factors, vascular risk factors, diffusion changes, and WMH. Older age, female sex, and hypertension were associated with higher baseline and progression of WMH as well as DTI measures (P  0.003). The effects of hypertension and sex on WMH were partially mediated by microstructural changes measured on DTI. Higher midlife physical activity was predictive of lower WMH through a direct impact on better white matter tract integrity as well as an indirect effect through reducing the risk of hypertension by lowering BMI. This study identified key risks factors, early brain changes, and pathways that may lead to the evolution of WMH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Leukoaraiosis or white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the hyperintense patches on T2-weighted or fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. WMH are important because they are a common manifestation of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and have a significant impact on motor and cognitive function (Whitman et al., 2001;Cees De Groot et al., 2000). They are also a predictor of increased risk of stroke and dementia (Debette and Markus, 2010). Older age and hypertension are the two well known risk factors associated with the development of WMH (Scharf et al., 2019;Habes et al., 2016;Gottesman et al., 2010;Godin et al., 2011). Recent studies show that females have higher WMH load suggesting that sex differences play a role in the evolution of WMH (Scharf et al., 2019;Fatemi et al., 2018). Even with vast literature on risk factors of WMH, a clear mechanistic understanding of the factors related to the evolution of WMH is still lacking.\nEmerging evidence shows significant microstructural changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) even before the appearance of WMH (Maillard et al., 2013;Maniega et al., 2015). Given the heterogeneity in the formation of WMH, our first hypothesis was that measuring early diffusion changes will aid in predicting future formation of WMH beyond the classical risk factor -hypertension. Further, evaluating midlife risk factors in the context of early diffusion changes are likely to lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms. Therefore, our second hypothesis was that midlife risk factors have an impact on WMH through early diffusion changes and measuring these early diffusion changes will allow us to identify the pathways for prevention of WMH.\nGiven these gaps in knowledge, our goal was to investigate the complex relationships between age, sex, midlife riskprotective factors, diffusion changes, and WMH. We evaluated this question using a large dataset (n  1564) of longitudinal multi-modal imaging data (WMH via FLAIR MRI and fractional anisotropy or FA from DTI MRI), clinical information (related to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes), and midlife risk factors (physical activity, cognitive activity, and smoking) from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). In addition to traditional statistical regression models, we leveraged causal structure discovery (CSD) models to study the interactions and pathways that lead to worsening WMH. The CSD methods have many strengths. As compared to traditional regression models for a specific outcome, they can model the complex (direct and indirect) relationships among all variables at the same time. Given a set of assumptions (Pearl, 2009), such as no unobserved confounders, the Causal Faithfulness condition, and the Causal Markov condition, the relationships in the causal graph admit a causal interpretation. As compared to traditional structural equation modeling and path analysis, the CSD methods are data driven and can incorporate existing knowledge regarding the domain of interest (Pearl, 2009). These discovered relationships help investigate causal interpretations whereby manipulating one variable can alter other variables. These models stand in contrast to models that investigate associative relationships and have demonstrated great success in many domains such as causal relationships in anxiety disorder, image recognition, or climate prediction (Li et al., 2020;Anker et al., 2019;Ebert-Uphoff and Deng, 2012).",

The acquisition and analysis of the FLAIR images were described previously (Graff-Radford et al., 2019). In brief, the possible WMH voxels on FLAIR images were identified initially through clustering via connected components . We then masked the FLAIR images using white matter (WM) masks derived from 3D MPRAGE segmentation to exclude the false-positive WMH voxels. These masks were edited by a trained analysts to remove non-WMH voxels.",

The data were preprocessed by skull stripping (Reid and Schwarz, 2018), denoising (Veraart et al., 2016), correcting for head motion and eddy current distortion (Andersson et al., 2016), Gibbs ringing (Kellner et al., 2016), and then debiasing (Koay et al., 2009). Diffusion tensors were then fit using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm implemented in dipy, (Garyfallidis et al., 2014) and then FA maps were generated. ANTs (Advanced normalization tools symmetric normalization) (Avants et al., 2011) was used to nonlinearly register each participants FA image to the in-house-version of Johns Hopkins University Eve WM atlas (Oishi et al., 2009), and then regional FA measures were computed. FA measures were computed for 12 WM tracts including genu of the corpus callosum, splenium of the corpus callosum, body of the corpus callosum, parahippocampal cingulum, cingulum, inferior temporal WM, superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract, anterior limb of the internal capsule, posterior limb of the internal capsule, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus.\nQuality assessment was performed by the visual inspection of each participants DTI image acquisition (both raw images and DTI based FA MD images) and registration of the JHU atlas to the images. In those who had potentially usable data, we found that a small percentage (0.28) of corresponding DTI scans failed quality control based on visual inspection of the DTI image acquisition and processing, and those scans were not used. Separately from QC, the FA and MD values were characterized using the median of voxel values within each JHU region of interest. The median was used to reduce the partial volume contamination from the edge voxels of each region. We also excluded the voxels with MD  2  10 -3 or  7  10 -5 mm 2 s as they were mostly cerebrospinal fluid or air, respectively. Moreover, we excluded the smallest JHU regions (cuneus WM, fusiform WM, lingual WM, and precuneus WM, all typically  7 diffusion voxels) as they were too small for reliable registration onto the corresponding subject structure, and liable to be dominated by edge voxels.",

Characteristics of the participants were summarized as mean (standard deviation) for the continuous variables, and count () for the categorical variables stratified by age groups. The differences between age groups were compared using ANOVA and χ 2 test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. We computed total intracranial volume using an in-house modified SPM software implementation and used WMH as a percentage of total intracranial volume (dividing by the total intracranial volume). Dividing by total intracranial volume accounts for differences in head size and is common practice in the field (Wardlaw et al., 2017). WMH was log-transformed for normality.\nRisk factors associated with baseline WMH and its progression. To analyze the risk factors of WMH and WM health at baseline, we used stepwise linear regression to select predictors from cardiometabolic, clinical, and demographics risk factors. We excluded HbA1c because of missingness. Samples with missing data elements were removed from the study. Longitudinal WMH scans were measured cross sectionally and used as the measurement for WMH progression. We showed the scatterplot of WMH and age, as well as the boxplots of WMH for (i) patients with and without hypertension and (ii) male and female patients across the five age groups. An unpaired t-test was used to test the WMH differences between the presence and absence of hypertension (and male and female sex) within each age group. To quantify the effect of age, sex, and hypertension on baseline WMH, an ordinary least squares multiple regression model was constructed regressing the WMH on age, sex, and hypertension status. For the longitudinal analysis, we modeled the WMH progression using linear mixed effect models (R package lmerTest, lme4) while controlling the same set of variables as in the baseline analysis.\nParticipants with only the baseline visit were removed from this part of the analysis.\nRisk factors associated with baseline WM health measured by DTI and its progression. We conducted the same set of analyses for WM health as we did for WMH.\nMediation effect of WM health on WMH. We first showed the scatterplot of WM health and WMH. We then applied mediation analysis to study the mediation effect of WM health on WMH. The steps of the mediation analysis can be found here (VanderWeele, 2016). We fitted two regression models to log-transformed WMH while controlling for the direct causes of WMH and WM. One model included WM health, and one model did not. All variables were z-transformed, so that the standardized effect sizes can be compared across models.",

To further explore the causal relationships between WMH and its potential midlife modifiers, we applied a CSD algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000;Glymour et al., 2019), Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (Ramsey et al., 2017) (FGES) with Fisher-z score and alpha 0.01, to generate the causal graph underlying the relationships.

      "text": "We originally considered 12 WM tracts to measure WM health and to evaluate their usefulness in predicting WMH. Because FA of all the WM tracts are highly correlated, we considered FA of the genu of the corpus callosum (Genu-FA) which consists of thin fibers in the anterior part of the corpus callosum and has greater vulnerability to aging and neurovascular damage (Wassenaar et al., 2019). Previous data supports the use of Genu-FA as an important marker of cerebrovascular disease (Vemuri et al., 2018;Raghavan et al., 2020). We also considered three other tracts that were also predictive of WMH for comparison -FA of the splenium of the corpus callosum (Splenium-FA), FA of the body of the corpus callosum (Body-FA), and FA of the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC-FA) as presented in Supplement material, section 3 sensitivity analysis.\nIn a model with Genu-FA as an outcome and vascular risk factors as predictors, only age, sex, and hypertension were associated with Genu-FA. As shown in Fig. 2A, Genu-FA decreases as age increases. Genu-FA significantly differed by sex in late-life with most significant findings in the 60-69 (P  0.001), and 80-89 (P  0.007) age groups (Fig. 2B). There were significant differences in Genu-FA between hypertensive and normotensive participants for all ages across late-life (P  0.006) (Fig. 2C). Predictions of baseline and progressive WM integrity through Genu-FA are shown in Models 3  4 in Table 2.

      "text": "When we looked at the relationship between WMH and Genu-FA as illustrated in the scatterplot of Fig. 3A, we found high correlation between the two variables that increased with age. To further investigate the relationship between Genu-FA and WMH, we built two standardized regression models of WMH, controlling for age, sex, hypertension. In model 5, we included Genu-FA but did not include in model 6 (Table 3). Our goal with this comparison was to understand the differences in standardized effect sizes between the two models. In model 5 from Table 3, Genu-FA was significantly associated with WMH (β  -0.29, P0.0001). Compared to model 6, where Genu-FA was not included, the effect size from male sex and hypertension both dropped by approximately 40 (β  -0.1, 0.09 to -0.06, 0.06). This mediation analysis demonstrated that the effect of sex and hypertension was mediated by Genu-FA. The above conclusion was also confirmed in longitudinal analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Fig. 3B shows the causal structure among the risk factors and WMH discovered by the CSD algorithm. A directed edge between two variables indicates a direct causal relationship. The relationships in the discovered graph are consistent with our previous finding as well as the mediation analysis. WMH measurements are log transformed before the standardized regression models.",

      "text": "Based on previous findings, we studied the relationship between midlife risk factors and WMH. We included three midlife indicators, midlife cognitive activity, midlife physical activity, and smoking status. Table S2 shows that smoking status was strongly correlated with WMH (β  0.05, P0.0046), and midlife physical activity was significantly associated with WM health (Genu-FA) (β  0.06, P0.008) after adjusting for other predictors.\nTo study the effects of risk and protective factors on WMH, causal relationships, not merely associations, are needed. Therefore, we applied the CSD algorithm to all the sets of predictor variables. On the basis of the Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (Ramsey et al., 2017) (FGES), the causal structure discovered by the CSD algorithm is shown in Fig. 4. The complex relationships were described in one graph where an edge implies a direct causal effect. We then fitted multiple regression models to estimate the effect sizes for each edge.\nWhile older age had an impact on all variables, male sex was associated with higher frequency of smokers, less cognitive activity, higher Genu-FA, and lower WMH. Physical and cognitive activity were highly correlated; there might exist other unobserved variables that are common between the two variables. Smoking (evernever, measured up to midlife) was associated with greater later life WMH load, as has been observed in many other studies. The associations between hypertension and WM healthWMH that have been described in previous sections are also shown as a direct relationship in the graph. A key finding from the CSD graph was that greater physical activity in midlife was associated with healthier WM outcomes (mainly higher Genu-FA). The effect of greater physical activity had two pathways to better WM outcomes -1) higher midlife physical activity was associated with higher Genu-FA (directly) and with lower WMH (through its effect on Genu-FA); 2) lower midlife physical activity was associated with higher BMI and higher BMI was associated with higher frequency of hypertension at the time of the scan which in turn contributed to lower WM health (lower Genu-FA and higher WMH).\nThe sex specific observations were interesting. Male sex was associated with higher frequency of smokers and had an impact on WM health through 1) direct impact on WMH and 2) through higher BMI contributing to greater frequency of hypertension. However, males in general had better WM outcomes as also confirmed by regression models suggesting that the net impact of male sex on WM outcomes was positive. While most of the relationships in the graph detected were plausible, there was one suggested relationship between higher cognitive activity and higher BMI that was not intuitive and should be interpreted with caution. Additional longitudinal data in future studies will be able to discern the relationship between physical activity, cognitive activity, and BMI which are highly inter-related and complex.",

      "text": "It has been widely shown that hypertension impacts WMH (Lane et al., 2019;Guo et al., 2009;Cox et al., 2019), and there is also emerging evidence that vascular risk factors are associated with WM damage (Wassenaar et al., 2019;Maillard et al., 2015;Hannawi et al., 2018). Our results from models 1 and 3 (Table 2) provide further evidence for the association between hypertension and WMH and its relationship with frontal WM (lower Genu-FA). Consistent with our findings, previous studies have reported associations of hypertension with lower FA in the genu of corpus callosum (de Groot et al., 2016;Pantoni, 2010). However, the actual mechanism underlying the association between hypertension and WM health is more complex and not clearly understood. Hypertension may cause vascular impairment leading to vascular remodeling and reduced vascular reserve, which may cause Fig. 4. The causal structure graph discovered using the CSD algorithm. The estimated standardized coefficients were labeled next to each edge.\nX. Shen et al. arteriosclerosis, microatheroma, and microaneurysms. These processes result in reductions of blood flow, which can in turn cause myelin damage and gliosis (Wardlaw et al., 2013;Young et al., 2008) and the pathologies often observed as WMH on MRI (Arfanakis et al., 2020;Gyanwali et al., 2019). Our data also extends the past research from our group and others, showing that hypertension accelerated the progression of WMH (Lane et al., 2019;Lai et al., 2020;van Leijsen et al., 2018). In additional analyses, we observed that the impact of vascular health on WMH were mediated by WM health. Although hypertension was useful for prediction of future progression of WMH, WM microstructural integrity provides more information which is likely applicable earlier than WMH. Our findings are consistent with prior evidence showed that information captured by lower microstructural integrity was an independent predictor of conversion of normal appearing WM to WMH (Maillard et al., 2013;Khan et al., 2021;Vangberg et al., 2019;Vemuri et al., 2021). Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated distinct WM microstructural patterns with increasing WMH load even before the formation of lesions and pleiotropic effects, suggesting WM changes as the early measure of WMH (Alqarni et al., 2021). Previous longitudinal studies also have shown that microstructural WM alterations measured by FA and MD are correlated with future WMH (Cees De Groot et al., 2000;Maillard et al., 2013). More recently, we also found a stronger association between Genu-FA and WMH that lend support of the frontal WM damage due to systemic vascular health prior to WMH (Sachdev et al., 2009). However, there was no established link for a mediating effect of Genu-FA on WMH that makes these study findings more unique. This new finding might indicate the importance of targeting early changes in WM as a predictor of future changes of WMH in middle-aged and older adults. These findings also support the usefulness of DTI in clinical prevention trials targeting modifiable vascular risk factors and the reduction of WMH.",

    "Sex differences in WM health": {
      "text": "The current study also showed a sex-specific association with microstructural integrity of WM and found a greater vulnerability in females with greater baseline WMH burden and progressive WMH. These findings extend our past research (Fatemi et al., 2018;Lane et al., 2019) and several others (van den Heuvel et al., 2004;Sachdev et al., 2016;Miller et al., 2013), suggesting that sex is an important factor contributing to WMH. The possible explanations include genetic and hormonal factors, sexual dimorphism in WM microstructure, and their influence on CVD. A higher genetic heritability of WMH has been shown in women compared to men (Miller et al., 2020). The major hormonal changes in women are associated with pregnancy and menopause. Studies have suggested the link between hypertensive pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia and WMH (Cook et al., 2002;Liu et al., 2009). It is also possible that reduction in estrogen after menopause may have an influence and suggested that hormone replacement therapy might protect the WM integrity (Liu et al., 2009;Jayachandran et al., 2020;Zeydan et al., 2019). However, a recent study in women of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study failed to reveal any significant association of menopausal hormone treatments with WMH (Coutinho, 2014). Although studies often considered a possible association of bilateral oophorectomy with WMH formation and progression (Cook et al., 2002), no significant evidence is available yet (Sullivan et al., 2010). Evidence also suggested that a higher frequency of arterial stiffness in women might lead to increased WMH burden through cerebrovascular remodeling (Westerhausen et al., 2003).\nInterestingly, the male effect on WMH was mediated through better WM health, suggesting that organization of WM fiber tracts are relatively preserved in men. The mediating effect of higher Genu-FA contributing to lower WMH in men has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. However, prior studies of the corpus callosum revealed inconsistent findings in association with sex in which some reported higher FA in men (Kanaan et al., 2012;Oh et al., 2007), others found higher FA in women (Nuñez et al., 2000;Cerghet et al., 2006). Animal studies have shown that there is a greater proportion (and area) of myelinated fibers in males than females in the corpus callosum (Debette et al., 2011), which could explain greater white matter reserve in men to ongoing damage. Another possible mechanism may be the different protein composition in myelin sheaths and the greater turnover of oligodendrocytes observed in females (Durhan et al., 2016). Further research is warranted to investigate the sexual dimorphism of WM health and WMH.",

    "Factors driving WM changes": {
      "text": "The local relationships between midlife modifiers and WM measurements extracted from Fig. 4 are shown in Fig. 5. Consistent with previous findings (Gray et al., 2020;Fleischman et al., 2015), we found smoking is associated with WMH which were confirmed by both the regression and CSD analyses. These associations between cigarette exposure and WMH were also well established in two large samples from the UK Biobank (Maillard et al., 2015;Vesperman et al., 2018). Our findings further provide evidence for an association between smoking effects and poorer WM integrity. As expected, there was an association between smoking and lower Genu-FA, these anterior fibers are most susceptible to normal and neurovascular aging (Wassenaar et al., 2019;Maillard et al., 2015). In addition, midlife physical activity showed an indirect association with WMH through the path of WM health. There are also reports on the short and long term effects of physical activity on brain health. Evidence suggests that higher levels of physical activity attenuate the amount of WMH in middle aged and older adults (Palta et al., 2021;Tarumi et al., 2021). A recent study from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) suggests that greater levels of midlife and late-life physical activity may reduce cerebrovascular lesions in late-life (Wartolowska and Webb, 2021) and hence aid in preventing cognitive decline. Although, there is very little evidence on the effect of midlife physical activity on midlife WM integrity, a more recent study suggests that midlife aerobic exercise may prevent or slow down the detrimental age-related WM fiber integrity degradation (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2020). They also demonstrated greater FA in the genu, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus in middle aged aerobically trained adults compared to middle aged sedentary.\nIt is also well known that hypertension affects WMH (Lane et al., 2019;van Leijsen et al., 2018;Lampe et al., 2019;Griffanti et al., 2018), however, the indirect pathway through BMI was not established before. Interestingly, BMI association with WMH has been reported (Griffanti et al., 2018;Lampe et al., 2019), with higher volumes in women, especially in the deep WMH (van den Heuvel et al., 2004). In the present work, using a causal model, without any prior information, the model identified an indirect relationship with WMH. Further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesized mechanism and better establish the interrelationships. Altogether, our data revealed the neuroprotective mechanism by which better midlife physical and cognitive activity and not smoking may protect against cerebrovascular sequelae. Further, we provided evidence that DTI based measures may be appropriate as surrogate measures of WMH for clinical trials targeting vascular risk factors.\nWhile studying the midlife modifiers of WMH, we implemented causal structure discovery to generate the causal graph among risk factors and WMH. The discovered graph was then compared with the results from traditional statistical analyses. The workflow that embedded CSD method provides benefits in the following ways: (1) Under a set of assumptions, the relationships discovered from CSD methods have a causal interpretation. For example, a causal relationship from X to Y has the interpretation that changes in X lead to changes in Y. We also note that these causal conclusions are potential hypotheses that still need to be validated with further experiments; (2) When the goal of the study is not merely predicting the outcome, knowing the structure among risk factors helps understand the underlying biological mechanism with reasonably high accuracy (Shen et al., 2020); (3) In our current workflow, the CSD model was mainly used for validating the conclusion from well-established traditional methods. However, it can also be used for hypothesis generation. We can design the regression analyses based on the causal graph obtained through CSD methods. The workflow of how the CSD model was used may change the way of investigating the relationship between risk factors and targets of interests. The goal of the study is not to study all variables that influence WM outcomes. In our study, the framework is focused on finding early brain measures and early (risk and protective) factors that influence WMH trajectories. We tested this framework by modeling brain measures as outcomes (i.e. WMH and DTI) using regression models and also modeled the complex relationships using CSD with all factors in a single model. Our goal was to generate test hypotheses but not design treatment trials. Given the large number of variables, causal analysis can be leveraged to identify critical variables for further rigorous investigation. The method allows identification of key variables that can be potentially targeted for treatment trials.",

    "Strengths and Limitations": {
      "text": "The study has several strengths. First, the availability of large data set with diffusion, FLAIR, and T1 weighted MRI across the adult lifespan enabled us to study their complex causal relationship. Second, the information on the vascular risk factors based on their medical records through REP was crucial, although none of laboratory values showed significance. The third strength was the newly implemented workflow, which by combining the CSD methods with regression analysis, may improve the design of prevention trials.\nThe study also has some limitations. First, although we considered the longitudinal aspect, only 10 percent of participants had 3 or more observations, and more than half of participants have one available visit. To make use of all available data, we conducted pairs of analyses, one regression analysis for baseline observations, and one mixed effect analysis for longitudinal data. Ideally, longitudinal data can provide more knowledge when studying the mixed effect, and we have shown before that the temporal information naturally provided by the longitudinal data also helps the CSD method to achieve higher accuracy 84. Second, we only considered the global measure of WMH and did not consider regional variability. Third, relatively shorter longitudinal observation intervals. Fourth, though we did extensive bootstrapping to confirm our study findings, we acknowledge that the uniqueness of this dataset with extensive clinical and imaging data limits our ability to replicate this in an independent dataset. Fourth, a possible limitation may be that many laboratory values were under control by medications, so they are likely to become less predictive compared with the disease diagnosis code. Fifth, the smaller sample size in the cognitively impaired participants reflects the population-based sample. In the future, we would be able to extend the study to a large sample to investigate the complex interplay between regional measures of WM health and WMH.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "The present study demonstrated a significant age, sex, and hypertension association with WMH. The relationship between vascular factors and WMH can be better explained by early changes in WM microstructural integrity. The midlife modifiers emerged as important components of WM health. Hence midlife may be the relevant window for prevention of late-life WMHs and measuring microstructural integrity using DTI can aid in better design and monitoring of prevention trials.",

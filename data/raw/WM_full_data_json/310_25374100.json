    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that the human brain is a large scale complex network. The structural network is reported to be disrupted in cognitively impaired patients. However, there have been few studies evaluating the effects of amyloid and small vessel disease (SVD) markers, the common causes of cognitive impairment, on structural networks. Thus, we evaluated the association between amyloid and SVD burdens and structural networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, we determined if network parameters predict cognitive impairments. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to DTI data from 232 cognitively impaired patients with varying degrees of amyloid and SVD burdens. All patients underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET to detect amyloid burden, MRI to detect markers of SVD, including the volume of white matter hyperintensities and the number of lacunes, and detailed neuropsychological testing. The whole-brain network was assessed by network parameters of integration (shortest path length, global efficiency) and segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity). PiB retention ratio was not associated with any white matter network parameters. Greater white matter hyperintensity volumes or lacunae numbers were significantly associated with decreased network integration (increased shortest path length, decreased global efficiency) and increased network segregation (increased clustering coefficient, increased transitivity, increased modularity). Decreased network integration or increased network segregation were associated with poor performances in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal-executive functions. Our results suggest that SVD alters white matter network integration and segregation, which further predicts cognitive dysfunction.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "The most common causes of dementia are mixed types of dementia, comprising features of Alzheimers disease (AD) and small vessel disease (SVD) 1. Amyloid burdens and SVD markers such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes are reported to be independently associated with cognitive impairments 2. Recent studies also showed that amyloid and SVD burdens independently affected cortical atrophy in specific patterns, and had differential effects on functional networks 3,4. However, there were few studies evaluating the independent effects of amyloid and SVD burdens on microstructural change of white matter 5,6.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive technique that can be used to reflect the microstructural tissue status. Recent advance in graph theoretical analysis provides an efficient and quantitative way to model a large-scale complex network. Using the theoretical framework of networks and graphs, the brain can be represented as set of nodes (brain regions) joined in pairs by lines (white matter connectivity) 7. The ability to rapidly combine specialized information from distributed nodes can be quantified into measures of network integration (shortest path length, global efficiency), and the ability for specialized processing to occur within densely interconnected groups of nodes can be quantified into measures of network segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity) 8.\nThere is growing evidence that the human brain is a large scale complex network 91011. The ideal healthy brain exhibits a small-world character 12, which optimally balances information segregation and integration, resulting in efficient organization that reduces the cost of maintaining many connections but also allows for efficient movement of information 13. The efficient organization of these networks is affected in various degenerative diseases 141516. Furthermore, recent studies suggested that network disruption follows disease-specific patterns that resemble the architecture of brain connectivity networks 10,11. However, the relationship between proteinopathies in these degenerative diseases, such as amyloid- in AD, and brain networks remains unclear. In addition, there have been few studies evaluating the effects of SVD markers on large-scale brain networks 17. Furthermore, there were no studies evaluating whether amyloid burdens and SVD markers (WMH and lacunes) were independently associated with white matter network, which were further associated with cognitive impairments.\nIn this study, we aimed to determine if amyloid and SVD burdens independently affect the whole-brain white matter networks by applying graph analysis to DTI data in a large sample of patients with varying degrees of amyloid and SVD burden. The whole-brain network was assessed by network parameters of integration (shortest path length, global efficiency) and segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity). We also examined if network parameters predict cognitive impairment.",

We included 45 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 69 with probable AD dementia, 67 with subcortical vascular MCI (svMCI), and 70 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). All patients were clinically diagnosed at the Samsung Medical Center. Probable AD dementia patients fulfilled criteria proposed by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association 18. Patients with SVaD met the diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia as determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and fulfilled imaging criteria for SVaD proposed by Erkinjuntti et al. 19. The aMCI and svMCI patients met Petersens criteria for MCI with modifications as previously described 20. All svMCI and SVaD patients had severe WMH on their MRI scans, which was defined as a cap or band (periventrivular WMH, PWMH)10 mm and deep white matter lesions (deep WMH, DWMH)25 mm, as modified from the Fazekas ischemia criteria 21. All aMCI and AD cases were classified as having minimal (PWMH 5 mm and DWMH 5 mm) or moderate WMH (between minimal and severe grades). The WMH were in compliance with the WMH of presumed vascular origin definition proposed by the Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging (STRIVE) 22. Detailed criteria for aMCI and svMCI are described in Supplementary Text 1. Patients with aMCI or AD were regarded as having AD-related cognitive impairment (ADCI), while those with svMCI or SVaD were considered to have subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI). We excluded patients with territorial infarctions and those with WMH due to radiation injury, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or leukodystrophy. All patients underwent a detailed diagnostic process including taking medical history, semi-structured questionnaires with respect to cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairments, and neurological examination 23. Blood tests included a complete blood count, blood chemistry test, vitamin B 12 folate measurements, syphilis serology, thyroid function testing, and APOE genotyping. We calculated disease duration from symptom onset to date of PiB-PET scan (see Table 1).\nWe obtained written informed consent from each patient and the Institutional Review Board of the Samsung Medical Center approved the study protocol.",

Second, in order to extract WMH, a threshold method was applied to the masked FLAIR MRI (the regions of white matter and gray matter in FLAIR images). Even though the threshold value was selected considering the range of image intensities, segmented results could contain false positive or false negative regions depending on the extent of WMH.

We reconstructed whole-brain white matter fiber tracts in native diffusion space for each subject using the fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm 26 embedded in the Diffusion Toolkit (http:www.trackvis.org) 27. We terminated tracking when the angle between two consecutive orientation vectors was greater than the given threshold of 45  or when both ends of the fibers extended outside of the white matter mask which was generated by the tissue segmentation process 28. Fiber cutoff filter was applied so that noisy short and false-positive long fibers (shorter than 20 mm and longer than 200 mm) were filtered out 29.\nT1-weighted images were co-registered to the b0 images using the affine registration tool from the FSL package (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfslflirt). Reconstructed whole-brain fiber tracts were inversely transformed into the T1 space and fiber tracts and AAL-based parcellated regions were located in the same space. Two nodes (regions) were considered to be structurally connected by an edge when at least the end points of three fiber tracts were located in these two regions. A threshold of the number of fiber tracts was selected to reduce the risk of false-positive connections due to noise or limitations in the deterministic tractography 28,30. FA value is an important index to evaluate fiber integrity 31. In this study, mean FA value along all fibers connecting a pair of regions was used to weight the edge.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study analyzed DTI data using graph theoretical analysis to examine alterations in white matter networks related to amyloid and SVD burdens in cognitively impaired patients. Our main findings were as follows: 1) Greater WMH volume or number of lacunes were associated with decreased network integration and increased network segregation; and 2) decreased network integration or increased network segregation correlated with decreased neuropsychological performance in variable domains including attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontalexecutive functions regardless of amyloid or SVD burdens. Taken together, our findings suggested that SVD burdens are associated with an imbalance in the large-scale brain networks which leads to cognitive deficits.\nOur major finding was that SVD burdens alter the white matter network toward decreased network integration and increased network segregation, which is characterization of regular topology. Regular topology has increased short-range connections but decreased long-range connections, eventually resulting in inefficient organization 13. Our findings suggested that altered network patterns induced by SVD burdens might be different from those shown in AD, in which white matter network is imbalanced toward a more random topology, as indicated by decreased network segregation and increased network integration 38. Although several studies have shown the relationships between SVD markers and white matter injury 5,6, our study is notable because this result shows the effect of SVD on changes in network characters, independent of amyloid and cortical atrophy.\nThe pathobiology of altered networks induced by SVD burdens is important. Regarding decreased integration of network, it might be explained to the fact that ischemia, usually located in periventricular or deep white matter areas, causes demyelination and axonal loss of long projection fibers, resulting in reduced global efficiency of signal propagation 39,40. Regarding increased network segregation, there are several possible interpretations. First, the increased network segregation might be related to some changes in microstructure and white matter connectivity in hub regions in particular. The loss or damage of hubs is likely to fragment a network into disconnected parts, resulting in increased network segregation 41. Second, it might not stem from an actual higher segregation but an artifact arising from relative decrease in network integration 28.\nWe found that amyloid burdens were not associated with any white matter network parameters. Previous studies regarding structural network in AD patients show inconsistent results, as some reported increased network integration 38, while others reported decreased network integration 16. However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating alterations of white matter network according to amyloid- burden in particular. It is possible that in previous studies of AD, not amyloid burden itself, but other factors characterizing AD might have been responsible for altered white matter network.\nOur final major finding was that decreased network integration or increased network segregation correlated with decreased neuropsychological performance in variable domains including attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal-executive functions regardless of amyloid and SVD burdens. There are several clinical implications. First, altered network toward a regular topology predicts worse performances in cognition. Previous studies regarding the relationship between white matter network parameters and cognition have shown that decreased network integration and decreased network segregation were related to cognitive impairments in AD patients 16,42. Interestingly, our findings suggested that altered network toward a regular topology is not only a characteristic of a network driven by SVD burdens but also the predictor of cognitive impairments in these patients. Second, multiple cognitive domains were related to white matter network parameters. Frontal-executive dysfunction by white matter lesions has been largely studied 43. Recent approaches on graph theoretical analysis have shown that white matter network parameters are associated with memory and frontal dysfunctions 16,42. Our data additionally shows that visuospatial dysfunction is strongly associated with altered white matter network parameters. Third, it is noteworthy that most of the association between altered white matter network and cognitive profiles were not independent of cortical atrophy, which suggests that cortical atrophy might have mediated the effect of white matter network disruption on cognitive impairment in various domains. Meanwhile, the association between increased network segregation and visuospatial dysfunction was not modulated by cortical thickness. This provides a unique clue that the network of white matter and thinning of grey matter have complex relationships and have different roles leading to cognitive impairment according to their respective cognitive domains. The complex relationships between amyloid, SVD, white matter network, cortical atrophy, and cognition need to be further studied. Finally, network parameters independently affect cognition regardless of amyloid and SVD burdens. A recent study based on AD patients showed that disturbances in white matter connectivity explained a substantial proportion of the variance in cognitive function on top of markers of brain atrophy and SVD 42. Along with previous studies, our findings suggest that white matter network parameters may explain a substantial portion of the variation in cognitive impairments in these subjects. Longitudinal studies are necessary to further validate our suggestion in individual subjects.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, we used a single diffusion tensor-based deterministic tractography algorithm, which does not detect fiber crossings. More recent acquisition sequences, such as the high angular resolution diffusion imaging methods including diffusion spectrum imaging, where crossing fibers are included in the model 44 have been shown to generate networks with a higher probability of long-distance connections 45. For future studies, such advanced diffusion acquisition methods can be used to construct enhanced anatomical networks. Second, the FA value, which we used to weight the edge in white matter network, may not precisely reflect connectivity 46. However, there is currently no formal consensus regarding selection of the edge weight which best describes the fiber tract connectivity and change in FA value probably reflect differences or damages in some aspects of connectivity. Third, due to limitations of the software package that we used for motion correction (FSL package), we could not apply rotation derived from subject head motion to the encoding vectors. This process will enhance the estimation of diffusion indices in future studies 46. Finally, PiB-PET may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect soluble amyloid oligomers, diffuse amyloid plaques, or neurofibrillary tangle-predominant AD. Fourth, although we excluded patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and tau frontotemporal dementia using clinical criteria, patients with synuclein or tau pathologies might have been included in the present study.\nThis study shows that the approach of characterizing the brain as a network using DTI and graph theoretical analysis can provide new insights into how amyloid and vascular burdens affect white matter connectivity in patients with cognitive impairment.",

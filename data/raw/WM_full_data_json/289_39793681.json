    "abstract": "We reviewed studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to characterise white matter changes in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons Disease Dementia (PDD). The search included MEDLINE and EMBASE, and we used a narrative strategy to synthesise the evidence. Data was extracted from 57 studies, of which the majority were considered good quality. Subjects with DLB and PDD had widespread white matter changes compared to healthy controls and Parkinsons disease without cognitive impairment, with a relative sparing of the hippocampus. Compared to subjects with Alzheimers disease (AD), DLB had greater changes in thalamic connectivity and in the nigroputaminal tract, while AD had greater changes in the parahippocampal white matter and fornix. Cognition was associated with widespread white matter changes, visual hallucinations with thalamic and cholinergic connectivity, and parkinsonism with changes in structures involved in motor control. DTI and tractography may therefore be well suited for discriminating DLB and PDD from other types of dementia, and for studying the aetiology of common symptoms.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative disorder which is characterised by progressive cognitive impairment, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations and Parkinsonism (Kane et al., 2018;McKeith et al., 2017). The clinical symptoms are similar to Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD), which the majority of subjects with Parkinsons disease (PD) eventually develop across the course of the illness (Buter et al., 2008). Together, DLB and PDD make up Lewy body dementia (LBD), which are both characterised by the accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein protein and formation of Lewy-bodies in the brain (McKeith et al., 2017). On T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subjects with DLB displays cortical atrophy compared to healthy controls, but this is relatively mild compared to subjects with Alzheimers disease (AD) and correlates poorly with the core clinical symptoms of DLB (Oppedal et al., 2019). Consequently, the aetiology of these symptoms is thought to relate to impairment in subcortical structures where structural, functional and neurochemical changes have been observed (Arnaoutoglou et al., 2019).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique which measures the magnitude, degree and orientation of the water diffusion in brain tissue (Alexander et al., 2007). In healthy white matter tracts, water diffusion mainly occurs in the direction parallel to the axonal tracts, but this changes in the context of neurodegeneration. This makes DTI a valuable technique to analyse microstructural damage of white matter tracts in the brain. DTI is commonly expressed as fractional anisotropy (FA), which describes the degree of diffusion directionality, or mean diffusivity (MD), which describes the magnitude of the water diffusion. Axial diffusivity (axD) and radial diffusivity (RD) describes the magnitude of diffusion in specific directions and may be able to differentiate whether changes to diffusion occurs because of myelin pathology or due to axonal loss. This has been demonstrated in a mouse model of dysmyelination, where RD but not axD was increased (Song et al., 2002). However, it is unclear how this translates to neurodegenerative diseases in humans, which is usually the result of multiple pathological processes. Furthermore, FA, MD, axD and RD are also affected by crossing white matter fibres, white matter hyperintensities due to cerebrovascular disease, and increased extracellular free-water (FW) resulting from neurodegeneration to surrounding grey matter structures. There have been several developments to improve the specificity of diffusion imaging for detecting white matter neurodegeneration which are summarised in Table 1. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) quantifies the deviation in water diffusion (excess kurtosis) from standard Gaussian distribution, providing a measure of the surrounding tissue complexity which is more specific than standard DTI (Jensen et al., 2005). Free water (FW) mapping and elimination reduces the effect of voxel contamination by CSF or oedema by correcting the standard DTI measures for the presence of isotropic FW (Pasternak et al., 2009). Furthermore, fixel-based analysis quantifies specific fibre populations within a voxel to overcome the challenges of crossing white-matter fibres (Dhollander et al., 2021). Recently, several methods have fit a geometric model to the diffusion signal to provide a more realistic representation of different tissue compartments which exists within the individual voxels. This includes the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model which predicts the neurite density, orientation, and CSF volume fraction (Zhang et al., 2012;Guerrero et al., 2019), and the soma and neurite density imaging (SANDI) model which incorporates the size and density of cell bodies (Palombo et al., 2020). Although further histological validation is needed, these models may improve our understanding of how changes DTI markers in neurodegenerative conditions relate to changes in specific tissue compartments.\nAnother application of DTI imaging is the index of diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS index) (Taoka et al., 2017). This uses the diffusivity metrics at the level of the lateral ventricle body to estimate flow in the perivascular space, also known as the glymphatic system. Reduced flow of misfolded proteins in the glymphatic system may be contributing to neurodegenerative disease, and the ALPS index correlates with severity of Alzheimers disease (Taoka et al., 2017).\nCommonly used methods to analyse DTI data across subject groups include voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline. In VBM, the DTI image from each subject is registered to a common space, and group differences are analysed using voxelwise statistics. The limitation of this approach is that individual anatomical differences may cause misalignment of voxels and lead to erroneous results. To reduce the risk of misalignment, the TBSS pipeline takes diffusion data from each individual scan and projects this onto a mean FA skeleton (Smith et al., 2006). DTI data can also be processed using white matter tractography to measure connectivity along a specific white matter tracts which can make analysis more anatomically or functionally meaningful. There are various automatic fibre tracking algorithms used. Early deterministic algorithms start from a seed point and proceeded one step at a time based on the direction of greatest water diffusion to reconstruct the white matter tract (Zhang et al., 2022). These have largely been replaced by probabilistic algorithms which also incorporate the inherent uncertainty of DTI to select the most probable path (Jones and Pierpaoli, 2005). The tractography algorithm generates a whole-brain tractogram of streamlines which can be grouped into bundles representing anatomical white matter tracts of interest. This is done by selecting streamlines in a region of interest (ROI), placed either manually or based on a brain atlas, or by using algorithms to discard streamlines which are outliers and unlikely to correspond to the anatomical tract (Zhang et al., 2022). Alternatively, direct segmentation of a tract of interest can be performed by selecting the probable location of the tract from DTI or volumetric data, prior to running the tractography algorithm (Zhang et al., 2022). The benefit of such subject-specific tractography (such as TRACULA) is that it addresses the issue of voxel misalignment, although information about local white matter structure may be lost by having to average the diffusion measurements across the full tract. Another approach is to perform regional segmentation of brain structures based on the connectivity with target areas. For example, this has been successfully used to map thalamic connectivity (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014;Delli Pizzi et al., 2015a;Delli Pizzi et al., 2015b).\nThe aim of this review is to systematically summarise the DTI and tractography studies to date in subjects with LBD. This will clarify whether this is a good technique to assess microstructural white-matter changes in LBD and whether changes in specific tracts are useful to discriminate LBD from healthy controls, and subjects with other forms of dementia. We also aim to clarify whether microstructural white-matter changes are associated with the core clinical symptoms in LBD, to better understand their aetiology.",

      "text": "A literature search was done on the Ovid platform covering both MEDLINE and EMBASE and using the search terms: (diffusion tensor imaging OR diffusion weighted imaging OR DWI OR DTI OR tractography OR white matter tracts OR white matter OR tracts OR fibre tracking) AND (DLB OR Lewy bodies OR Lewy OR Lewy body dementia OR dementia OR parkin). The search was limited to studies in English, using DTI in vivo in humans but was not limited by year of publication. Case studies, case series, duplications, conference abstracts, review articles, and studies with less than 5 subjects with LBD were excluded. The search was initially run on 1st July 2022 with a subsequent search being run on 10th May 2024 to capture more recent studies. Titles, abstracts and selected full texts were screened by one author (A.A.S.L.) using Rayyan (https:www.rayyan. ai). All studies which met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by (Jensen et al., 2005) Estimates the deviation in water diffusion from standard Gaussian distribution.\nProvides a measure of tissue complexity.\nRequires high bvalues.\nFree-water (FW) elimination and mapping ( Pasternak et al., 2009) Estimates the effect of isotropic FW on DTI measures.\nReduces two authors (A.A.S.L. and J.T.O.) for relevance. The reference lists of all included studies were also reviewed for additional articles which met the inclusion criteria. Quality and risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (Wells et al., 2021). This tool assesses methodological quality and risk of bias of non-randomised studies using three domains (selection, comparability and exposure), to allow studies to be stratified as being of good, fair or poor quality. Data was extracted systematically by one author (A.A.S.L.) using according to pre-defined data fields, collecting data about subject characteristics, MRI scanner characteristics, DTI and tractography method, group differences in DTI metrics, and the association between DTI metrics and the core clinical features of LBD. These included associations with cognition, visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations and severity of motor symptoms. In order to simplify data synthesis, we did not discriminate between findings in the left or right hemisphere. A narrative synthesis strategy was used to assess whether there was evidence of a significant effect. All available DTI metrics were included in the data synthesis, but comparison between individual DTI metrics is beyond the scope of this review. The extracted data is presented in supplementary tables S1 and S2. DLB and PDD studies were separated when analysing group differences but grouped together when analysing associations with core clinical features. Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL) was used to visualise the differences between subjects with DLB and AD in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, using several atlases which best corresponded to the findings from the original publications (Smith et al., 2004). The manuscript complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021). The review was not pre-registered.",

      "text": "The article selection process is shown in Fig. 1. The search generated 23023 hits which were screened to select 831 articles for full-text review. Of these, 55 articles met the inclusion criteria, with an additional two studies identified by screening the reference lists. Two further studies initially appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but were excluded from the data extraction and synthesis as they only included DTI data from post-mortem samples (Lin et al., 2023(Lin et al., , 2024)). Hence, data was extracted from a total of 57 studies. The quality assessment (see supplementary table S3) showed that 56  (n  32) of included studies were of good quality, 37  (n  21) fair quality, and 7  (n  4) poor quality. The results did not change when excluding the studies with poor quality. Most studies were small and there was a great variety of MRI scanner characteristics and DTI methodology applied. There were 36 studies which used DTI only, of which 11 used TBSS for extraction of DTI metrics. One study used NODDI, one DKI, two used FW mapping and two used the DTI-ALPS index. Of the 21 tractography studies, 11 used a probabilistic algorithm, 8 used deterministic algorithm and 2 did not specify the type of tractography used.",

There were also changes to grey matter in the precuneus (Firbank et al., 2007;ODonovan et al., 2014;Watson et al., 2012) and the thalamus (Watson et al., 2012); as well as in the white matter tracts connecting the thalamus and the prefrontal (Caso et al., 2021;Delli Pizzi et al., 2015a), amygdala, parietal and occipital cortices (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014, 2015b). A few studies found reduced FA and increased MD, RD and axD in other parts of the motor system, including the corticospinal tract (Caso et al., 2021), pontocerebellar system (Caso et al., 2021;Chabran et al., 2022) and the primary motor cortex (Chabran et al., 2022). Tractography studies also found increased MD, RD and axD in the cholinergic pathways (Schumacher et al., 2023(Schumacher et al., , 2022) ) and FA changes in the nigrostriatal tract (Pardini et al., 2020). There were no differences between DLB and control subjects in the hippocampus (Firbank et al., 2007;Kantarci et al., 2010;Mak et al., 2017), although one study using multishell DTI acquisition with a higher b-value found increased MD, but not FA, in the entorhinal white matter (Mak et al., 2024).\nThere have only been two longitudinal DTI studies comparing DLB with healthy controls. One study found widespread increases in FW fraction within the DLB group after 12 and 24 months, and this was significantly increased compared to controls in the insula, parahippocampus, cingulum, Rolandic operculum, inferior frontal and supramarginal white matter after 24 months (Chiu et al., 2024). The other study found no longitudinal changes in FA or MD within the DLB group and no changes compared to controls after 12 months (Firbank et al., 2016).",

Subjects with PDD also had lower mean of kurtosis tensor in the anterior thalamic radiations and cingulum (Nilsson et al., 2015). There were also grey matter changes as seen by reduced FA and increased MD, RD and axD in the substantia nigra (Hattori et al., 2012;Kamagata et al., 2013;Perea et al., 2013) and thalamus (Gorges et al., 2019). Three studies with fair quality found that there were no differences between PDD and controls in the hippocampus (Chen et al., 2015;Novellino et al., 2018) and fornix (Melzer et al., 2013).\nIn summary, multiple studies using a variety of protocols and DTI metrics have identified widespread white matter changes in subjects with DLB and PDD compared to healthy controls, with a relative sparing of the white matter in the hippocampus.",

    "DLB and PDD versus AD": {
      "text": "Several studies directly compared DLB with AD and most were of good quality. Fig. 2 shows the brain regions where significant differences were found when comparing DLB and AD. One study using the TBSS pipeline found that DLB had lower FA compared to AD in the thalamus and pons (Watson et al., 2012), whereas studies using other methodologies have failed to find group differences in the basal ganglia or brainstem (Firbank et al., 2007;Kantarci et al., 2010;ODonovan et al., 2014). Tractography studies also found that DLB have changes to FA in the nigroputaminal tract (Pardini et al., 2020), higher MD in the tracts between the thalamus and the amygdala, parietal and occipital cortices (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014), and increased FW fraction in the cholinergic tract from the pedunculopontine nucleus to the thalamus (Schumacher et al., 2023). However, there were no differences between groups in the cholinergic tracts from the NBM or when using other DTI metrics (Schumacher et al., 2022(Schumacher et al., , 2023)). Subjects with AD had reduced FA and increased MD in the parahippocampal WM (Kantarci et al., 2010;Nedelska et al., 2015;Watson et al., 2012); fornix (Kantarci et al., 2010;Watson et al., 2012); hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (Kantarci et al., 2010). One study found that the AD group had increased MD and axD in widespread white matter areas including the corpus callosum, SLF, medial parietal WM, medial frontal WM, ILF, IFOF, anterior thalamic radiations and corticospinal tract (Caso et al., 2021). This study used TBSS followed by an exclusion mask to reduce the interference from white-matter hyperintensities, which may have exaggerated group differences. Finally, one study which compared amyloid positive subjects with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), the visual variant of AD, and amyloid negative subjects with DLB, found that PCA had reduced FA and increased MD in the posterior thalamic radiations, sagittal stratum, corpus callosum and the parietal and occipital white matter (Singh et al., 2024). It is difficult to compare these results to other DTI studies considering that most other studies would likely have excluded people presenting with atypical symptoms of AD. There were no differences between DLB and AD in the UF (Delli Pizzi et al., 2015a;Kiuchi et al., 2011;Serra et al., 2012), the internal capsule (Donaghy et al., 2020;Firbank et al., 2007); or the corona radiata (Donaghy et al., 2020). The only longitudinal study found that AD had increased MD in parietal and temporal white matter compared to DLB after one year of follow-up (Firbank et al., 2016). There were no longitudinal differences within the DLB or AD groups.\nOnly two studies of fair quality compared subjects with PDD and AD. One found that subjects with AD had reduced FA and increased MD in the hippocampus compared to subjects with PDD (Novellino et al., 2018), whereas the other reported that subjects with PDD had reduced FA and increased MD in widespread white matter tracts (Perea et al., 2013).

    "Cognition": {
      "text": "The cognitive decline in LBD is characterised by deficits in attention, visuospatial and executive function, whereas episodic memory is relatively well preserved compared to subjects with AD (Tröster, 2008). Most studies in LBD indicate that cognitive deficits are associated with a general disruption of white matter, rather than an impairment in any specific anatomical region, including impairment in attention, memory and visuospatial function. These widespread associations are not seen in healthy older adults and variation in memory function is instead associated with more restrictive white matter changes in the medial temporal lobe, cingulum and ILF (Kantarci et al., 2011). Whereas verbal fluency and executive function have been predominantly associated with frontal and temporal white matter changes in subjects with PD-NC and PD-MCI (Koshimori et al., 2015;Minett et al., 2018;Theilmann et al., 2013;Zheng et al., 2014), the associations with visuospatial function is more mixed. One study found that visuospatial function was associated with impairment in the left anterior thalamic radiation and superior parietal white matter (Chen et al., 2017), whereas another found that PD-NC who were low visual performers had extensive white matter impairment involving the corpus callosum, cingulum, posterior thalamic radiations, internal capsule, right hippocampus and corticospinal tract (Zarkali et al., 2021). Importantly, the low-visual performers with PD-NC were at a higher risk of progressing to PD-MCI than high-visual performers, indicating that visuospatial function may be a marker for disease progression. Due to widespread neurodegeneration in subjects with established dementia, it is possible that commonly used cognitive tests are not specific enough to link cognitive impairment in a specific domain to white matter impairment in a specific brain region, with impairment on tests instead reflecting the general progression of dementia.",

    "Visual hallucinations": {
      "text": "Several DTI and tractography studies support that impairment in thalamic white matter connections are associated with visual hallucinations in LBD. This include impaired cholinergic innervation of the thalamus (Schumacher et al., 2023), and reduced connectivity between the thalamus and the parietal and occipital cortices (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014;Mehraram et al., 2022). Similarly, studies of PD-NC have found that subjects with visual hallucinations had white matter impairment in the posterior thalamic radiations compared to subjects without hallucinations (Lee et al., 2016;Zarkali et al., 2022;Zarkali et al., 2020). The presence and severity of visual hallucinations in PD-NC have also been associated with grey matter volume loss in the upper brainstem and several thalamic nuclei (Lee et al., 2016;Nishio et al., 2017;Zarkali et al., 2022). Thalamic dysfunction may disrupt the default mode network (DMN), which is involved in the top-down recruitment of autobiographical visual images used as predictive template for the bottom-up sensory input from the primary visual system (Onofrj et al., 2019). Dysfunction of the top-down attentional systems may lead to false predictions of what the sensory input actually represents, with the subsequent production of false images. This is further supported by evidence from functional MRI studies showing that the DMN and other attentional networks are altered in in LBD (Kobeleva et al., 2017), and also in PD-NC with visual hallucinations (Shine et al., 2014;Zarkali et al., 2020). The involvement of the wider attentional networks may also explain why several studies found associations between hallucinations in DLB and tracts not directly involved in the primary visual pathway, including the SLF, ILF, IFOF and UF (Kantarci et al., 2010;Zorzi et al., 2021). White matter changes in these tracts were coupled with reduced synchronisation of the DMN and dorsal attentional network, and the increased synchronisation in the ventral attentional network (Zorzi et al., 2021). Furthermore, in subjects with PD-NC, visual hallucinations have also been associated with the splenium of the corpus callosum, SLF, IFOF, ILF and hippocampus (Yao et al., 2016;Yuki et al., 2020;Zarkali et al., 2022;Zarkali et al., 2020). Only one of these studies also used functional neuroimaging, finding reduced connectivity between the hippocampus and the primary visual pathways, and greater functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the DMN (Yao et al., 2016). The cholinergic system is affected in LBD (Mehraram et al., 2022), PD-NC (Hepp et al., 2017) and in prodromal DLB (Schumacher et al., 2021;Hansen et al., 2022), and this may contribute to the dysfunction of the attentional control networks (Powell et al., 2020). Furthermore, cholinergic dysfunction may be associated with a phenotype characterised by prominent psychotic and mood symptoms in people with prodromal DLB (Hansen et al., 2022). Clinical trials have shown that cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for improving cognition, functioning and visual hallucinations in DLB, further implicating the cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric symptoms (McKeith et al., 2017).",

    "Cognitive fluctuations": {
      "text": "Studies using imaging modalities other than DTI have linked fluctuations in DLB with atrophy in the pulvinar and ventral lateral nuclei (Watson et al., 2017), increased perfusion (OBrien et al., 2005), increased R2 values (Chabran et al., 2022), and increased cholinergic metabolites (tChotCr ratio) in the thalamus (Delli Pizzi et al., 2015b). Fluctuations have also been associated with changes to perfusion in the occipital lobe, and in a network involving the basal ganglia, cerebellum and supplementary motor area (OBrien et al., 2005;Taylor et al., 2013). Despite this, DTI and tractography studies have not demonstrated any relationship between white matter changes and fluctuations, including in the thalamic and cholinergic tracts (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b;Schumacher et al., 2022Schumacher et al., , 2023)). It has been suggested that the transient and unpredictable nature of fluctuations make them unsuitable to be studied using structural MRI, and that ambulatory EEG or functional MRI may be more suitable to understand their neurological basis (Matar et al., 2020).",

Most studies found a correlation between UPDRS and DTI measures (reduced FA and increased MD) in post-central gyrus (Firbank et al., 2011;Watson et al., 2012); the amygdala (Kantarci et al., 2010;ODonovan et al., 2014); lateral cholinergic (Schumacher et al., 2022); thalamus, pons, medulla, precentral gyrus and precuneus (Watson et al., 2012); reduced FDC of the corpus callosum (Sang et al., 2022); and the DTI-Alps index (Chen et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2024). Longitudinally there was an association between UPDRS and increased FW in the amygdala, inferior frontal operculum, Heschls gyri and substantia nigra (Chiu et al., 2024). Six studies found no correlation between DTI markers and UPDRS-III (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b;Firbank et al., 2016;Melzer et al., 2013;Schumacher et al., 2023), most of these had a relatively low number of participants.",

      "text": "Four studies have examined the utility of DTI to distinguish PDD and DLB from related conditions, but the evidence should be interpreted with caution as only one study had good quality. DLB and AD could be discriminated with an AUC of 0.82 using tractography of the nigroputaminal tract (Pardini et al., 2020). Similarly, using the FA of left arcuate fasciculus and right uncinate fasciculus could differentiate PD-MCI and PDD from MCI and dementia due to AD with an accuracy of 75 , although it was less accurate than T1 MRI and was also performed in a cohort with a high risk of bias (Kuhn et al., 2021). Furthermore, another study showed that progressive supranuclear palsy could be separated from a group of PD-NC and PDD with an AUC of 0.97 using FA of frontal white matter and the superior cerebellar peduncles (Spotorno et al., 2019). This was replicated in a validation cohort. Finally, PDD could be differentiated from idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus using deterministic tractography of the corticospinal tract (FA (AUC 0.89); axD (AUC 0.96)) (Hattori et al., 2011).\nIn summary, visual hallucinations are mainly associated with impairment in thalamic connectivity, while there were no associations with cognitive fluctuations. The severity of parkinsonism in DLB is mainly associated with changes in subcortical structures which are involved in motor control, as well as the cholinergic system, while the findings in PDD are more mixed. Finally, a few studies have shown that LBD can be differentiated from AD, PSP and idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, although these findings need to be replicated in larger and more representative cohorts.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The anatomical origin of the symptoms experienced by subjects with LBD are poorly understood, and are out of keeping with the grey matter atrophy seen on T1 structural MRI (Oppedal et al., 2019). DTI and tractography, which provides high-resolution imaging of white-matter tracts may be well suited for understanding the symptoms of LBD, and for discriminating between LBD and other types of dementia. The purpose of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the studies to date which have utilised DTI or tractography in subjects with LBD. There are other articles relating to this topic. Balazova et al. reviewed the use of several different MRI techniques in subjects with DLB and included 13 studies using DTI (Balazova et al., 2019). Cochrane et al. performed a systematic review of DTI studies in parkinsonian syndromes and included 14 studies with LBD or PDD (Cochrane and Ebmeier, 2013). Furthermore, Habich et al. summarised connectivity studies in DLB and included 16 studies using DTI (Habich et al., 2023). The strength of our current review is that it synthesises the evidence from 57 studies to provide a more comprehensive overview of how white-matter changes in LBD and how they relate to the neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

    "Diagnosis": {
      "text": "Multiple cross-sectional studies, using a variety of DTI acquisition and analysis protocols have demonstrated that subjects with LBD have extensive white matter changes compared to healthy controls, with a relative sparing of the white matter tracts connecting the hippocampus. Longitudinally, DLB was associated with widespread changes in FW fraction (Chiu et al., 2024), but this was not seen in the only other longitudinal study which examined FA and MD (Firbank et al., 2016). Subjects with PDD also have extensive white matter impairment compared with PD-NC, but only minor differences were found between PDD and PD-MCI. This could be due to the small number of studies who have included subjects with PD-MCI, or due to the heterogenous causes of MCI. Previous studies examining subjects with PD-NC found limited grey matter atrophy on T1 MRI (Schulz et al., 2018) but widespread white matter changes compared to healthy controls (Minett et al., 2018). Similarly, subjects with PD-MCI have widespread white matter changes, predominantly in frontal white matter tracts compared to PD-NC, both cross-sectionally and after 18 months of follow-up (Agosta et al., 2014;Melzer et al., 2013;Minett et al., 2018;Sejnoha Minsterova et al., 2020). Overall, these findings suggest that white matter changes occur relatively early in the disease process, although it is not clear what changes drive the progression from PD-MCI to PDD.\nStudies comparing white matter changes in subjects with LBD and AD have demonstrated fewer differences than might be expected, considering the differences in clinical presentation between these conditions. The most consistent finding is that subjects with AD have more severe white matter changes in the parahippocampal white matter and fornix (Kantarci et al., 2010;Nedelska et al., 2015;Novellino et al., 2018;Watson et al., 2012). These findings are consistent with T1 structural MRI studies which have found that AD is associated with significantly worse medial temporal atrophy than both DLB (Oppedal et al., 2019) and PDD (Burton et al., 2004). In contrast, subjects with DLB have worse white matter impairment in the nigroputaminal pathway (Pardini et al., 2020), the thalamus and pons (Watson et al., 2012), the cholinergic innervation of the thalamus (Schumacher et al., 2023), and in the white matter tracts between the thalamus and cortical areas (Delli Pizzi et al., 2014). Other related studies have found that DLB have worse grey matter atrophy in the dorsal midbrain compared to subjects with AD (Whitwell et al., 2007). Taken together, these findings suggest that the symptoms that discriminate DLB from AD are driven by changes to subcortical grey and white matter structures rather than cortical changes. This is further supported by a large multicentre study found that the degree and location of cortical atrophy is less important for discriminating between DLB and AD than the core clinical features of DLB (Oppedal et al., 2019).\nOnly one study has compared whole brain white matter tracts in PDD and AD, but the groups were inadequately matched, making the results difficult to interpret (Perea et al., 2013). Similarly, there is limited evidence of any differences in white matter changes between subjects with PDD and DLB, although there are only a few studies available. It would be particularly interesting to use tractography to examine the nigrostriatal tract in these conditions, since the major clinical difference is the length of time of motor impairment.\nDespite DTI being a commonly obtained MRI sequence, there is a scarcity of studies assessing the usefulness of this modality in clinical populations to support the diagnosis of LBD. Tractography of the nigroputaminal tract was able to discriminate DLB from AD (Pardini et al., 2020), while DTI was inferior to other MRI modalities in discriminating PDD from AD (Kuhn et al., 2021). However, the nigroputaminal tract is unmyelinated and contain many crossing fibres which may create challenges for tractography algorithms (Pardini et al., 2020). Furthermore, two studies found that DTI and tractography could accurately distinguish idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and progressive supranuclear palsy from related conditions, including LBD (Hattori et al., 2011;Spotorno et al., 2019). This is encouraging, although larger studies are needed to examine clinical populations which are representative of the patients which are more commonly assessed in memory clinics. It is also unknown whether DTI can improve the sensitivity of investigations such a dopamine active transporter (DAT) scan which is commonly used to support a diagnosis of LBD (McKeith et al., 2017).",

    "Parkinsonism": {
      "text": "The UPDRS is widely used in clinical studies of PD and related conditions to systematically score the symptoms of the illness (Ramaker et al., 2002). Part III of the scale measures the degree of motor impairment. In PD-NC, DTI changes in the basal ganglia are associated with the UPDRS-III score (Le et al., 2020). Furthermore, whole-brain MD was found to predict decline in UPDRS-III scores after 18 months of follow-up in a combined cohort of PD-NC and PD-MCI (Minett et al., 2018). Despite its wide use in PD-NC, only four DTI studies in patients with PDD have utilised the scale, finding an association with white matter impairments in the corpus callosum and with glymphatic system function (the DTI-ALPS index), but not with any areas directly involved in motor control (Chen et al., 2021;Melzer et al., 2013;Sang et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2024). In DLB, where the motor impairment is usually milder than in PDD, studies have found that the UPDRS-III score is primarily associated with DTI changes in areas involved in motor control, including the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, brainstem, amygdala and precentral gyrus (Chiu et al., 2024;Kantarci et al., 2010;ODonovan et al., 2014;Watson et al., 2012). Interestingly, UPDRS-III score was also associated with NBM volume and the lateral cholinergic tract in subjects with DLB (Schumacher et al., 2022). Reduced cholinergic innervation to the thalamus is associated with falls in PD, and treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been found to reduce the number of falls (Bohnen and Albin, 2011). This suggests that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial for motor impairment, in addition to its use for neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "The main limitation of this review is the nature of the included studies. Due to the challenges involved in recruiting and scanning patients with LBD, most studies had a case-control design with small sample sizes. This was captured by the quality assessment which showed that only 56  of included studies were of good quality. In addition, there is a high risk of selection bias which limits how representative the studied subjects are of clinical populations with LBD. We also found that there was a significant heterogeneity in the MRI acquisition protocol, the DTI and tractography analysis pipeline, and the metric chosen to measure the differences in diffusion, illustrating the lack of consensus in the best method to use. Similarly, there was a large heterogeneity in the type of cognitive tests used, which made it difficult to compare associations across different studies, although the scales that were used to measure the severity of motor impairment, hallucinations and fluctuations were largely standardised. The heterogenous results may also be due to the effect of Alzheimer disease co-pathology, since this is common in subjects with LBD and thought to influence symptoms and dementia progression (Coughlin et al., 2020). Only a few studies considered amyloid positivity in their subject recruitment and analysis (Caso et al., 2021;Donaghy et al., 2020;Mak et al., 2024;Nedelska et al., 2015;Nicastro et al., 2020;Singh et al., 2024), although this may be more common with the novel development of plasma biomarkers for Alzheimers disease (Ashton et al., 2024). Both AD and LBD have a higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume than healthy controls, with some studies suggesting that people with DLB have higher WMH volume compared to AD (Sarro et al., 2017;Caso et al., 2021). Although, WMHs seen on MRI imaging are presumed to be due to cerebrovascular disease, neuropathology studies do not support that DLB is associated with a higher burden of ischaemic white matter lesions (Hijazi et al., 2022). Nevertheless, WMH volume may have a large effect on DTI markers (Svärd et al., 2017), and it is possible that some of the observed group differences are influenced by unequal distribution of WMHs. Some of the included studies excluded participants with extensive WMH volume (Bozzali et al., 2005;Kiuchi et al., 2011), whereas the studies which statistically corrected for WMHs found that this either exaggerated (Caso et al., 2021), or had minimal impact (Donaghy et al., 2020) on group differences. Although this indicates that the observed differences in DTI measures were largely independent of cerebrovascular disease, it should be considered in future analyses of DTI data. Our decision not to discriminate between changes in the left and right hemisphere may also have limited our analysis, since laterality of changes is likely to have an impact on symptoms. Similarly, we did not analyse whether certain DTI methods were better at detecting changes in this population, as it is possible that recent developments such as FW mapping, NODDI, and DKI were more sensitive than earlier methods which only considered FA and MD. Although worth considering, only 457 included studies used these methods and thus it should not have a great impact on the major conclusions of the review.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "We have systematically reviewed the literature and synthesised evidence from 57 studies using DTI and tractography to examine the impact of microstructural white matter changes in subjects with LBD. The main findings are that LBD have widespread impairment in white matter compared to healthy controls and subjects with PD and normal cognition. In comparison to subjects with AD, DLB have greater impairment in thalamic connectivity and the nigroputaminal tract whereas AD have more changes in the parahippocampal WM and fornix. The cognition and motor impairment in LBD correlate with white matter changes in widespread areas, whereas visual hallucinations are predominantly associated with changes in thalamic connectivity, likely representing changes to attentional networks. The findings from this review will hopefully inform the design of future studies using DTI or tractography in LBD, as we have highlighted anatomical regions of interests and also the main gaps in the current literature. In particular, there are few studies using DTI in subjects with PDD to understand whether the white matter impairment is different from subjects with PD-MCI and DLB, and very few longitudinal studies of DTI changes over time. Further studies are also needed to clarify whether DTI or tractography is useful for improving diagnostic accuracy of subjects with LBD in clinical populations, and whether it correlates with longitudinal progression of symptoms.",

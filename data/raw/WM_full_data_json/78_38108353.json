    "abstract": "Background: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). However, its relation with tau pathology (i.e., aberrant tau protein behavior in tauopathies such as AD) has been inconclusive. Objective: This study investigated the interaction between a high-fat diet (HFD) and tau pathology in adult male mice. Methods: Transgenic mice overexpressing human P301S Tau (those with the pathology) and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to behavioral tests, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and western blotting analysis to investigate the effects of prolonged HFD versus regular diet during adulthood. Results: HFD increased body weight in both WT and P301S mice but had minimal effect on blood glucose levels. The brain response to HFD was tau genotype-specific. WT mice exhibited decreased recognition memory and enhanced network connectivity in fMRI, while P301S mice exhibited white matter tract disorganization in DTI as the sole significant finding. The reduction of insulin receptor , insulin downstream signaling, neuronal nuclear protein, CD68-positive phagocytic activity, and myelin basic protein level were confined to the cortex of WT mice. In contrast to P301S mice, WT mice showed significant changes in the tau protein and its phosphorylation levels along with increased soluble neurofilament light levels in the hippocampus. Conclusions: HFD-induced brain dysfunction and pathological changes were blunted in mice with the pathology and more profound in healthy mice. Our findings highlight the need to consider this interaction between obesity and tau pathology when tailoring treatment strategies for AD and other tauopathies.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and its development and clinical course are determined by genetic and environmental interactions 1. Epidemiological studies have established obesity as a modifiable risk factor for AD and related dementia 234. When considering obesity in midlife, defined as a body mass index (BMI)30, the estimated relative risk of developing AD is approximately 1.6 2, contributing to up to 20 of all dementia cases 4. Notably, this causal relationship is age-specific; obesity does not appear to elevate the risk of AD in late life, being underweight is associated with an increased risk of AD 2. A number of mechanisms, such as increased neuroinflammation, more oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier disruption, synaptic damage, and neuronal death, have been suggested to contribute to obesity-related cognitive decline 567. However, there is controversy regarding its interaction with the core pathologies of AD, such as aberrant tau and amyloid- (A) protein behavior. Studies that have included cognitively normal individuals have shown that higher levels of obesity are correlated with lower cortical thickness in specific brain regions 8. However, in the context of AD, this effect may not be mediated by modification of AD-related pathologies 8. Cross-sectional correlation analyses have demonstrated that higher BMI is associated with lower cortical A uptake in PET imaging in clinically unimpaired older subjects 9,10 and with nonpathological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, such as higher CSF A 42 and lower tau protein levels, in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD 11,12. However, the proportion of patients with obesity in these studies was small, at around 10, making it difficult to clearly determine the impact of obesity on AD pathology. In addition, as most subjects recruited into these studies were in later life, when obesity is no longer associated with an increased risk of AD 2, it was not possible to discern the adverse effects of obesity on promotion of AD development in middle age.\nInvestigations have been conducted in animal models of AD to examine the association between obesity and AD pathology 131415. However, these have yielded inconsistent results, potentially stemming from the differences in the timing of initiation, duration, and composition of obesogenic diets among different studies. Furthermore, differences in transgene mutations, promoters, and background strains, which significantly influence tau pathology characteristics 16, as well as susceptibility to the diet, have been observed both within individual studies and across different studies 15. Hence, further welldefined studies are required using strain-matched controlled mice and careful monitoring of associated changes. In this study, we used wild-type (WT) littermates as controls. The animals were exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD) for a specific duration, focusing on the sensitive period of mid-adulthood to examine the impact of obesity. To validate the premortem status of brain functions and microstructure, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to behavioral analyses. Postmortem pathological examinations focused on tau pathology, which is highly correlated with clinical phenotypes in AD 17 and commonly observed in many brain disorders associated with clinical dementia 18. Our aim was to precisely investigate the impact of HFD-induced obesity on brain function and structure in relation to the tau genotype using a mouse model.",

      "text": "The PS19 mice with human tau P301S mutation on the B6C3F1 background (008169, The Jackson Laboratory, USA) and their littermate WT were used for the experiment. The selection of PS19 mice as tauopathy model aligns with the studys objectives because these mice are well-characterized and exhibit AD-like neurofibrillary tangle at midlife, approximately 6 months of age 16,19. Further, these mice demonstrate age-dependent non-cognitive and cognitive symptoms, along with neurodegeneration and microgliosis 19,20. Two female and one male heterozygous PS19 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and were bred in-house. The animal experiment followed the protocol that had been approved by the Ajou University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, 2019-0045). The procedures complied with ARRIVE guidelines and were carried out in accordance with the National Research Councils Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We used heterozygous male mice in this study to avoid early motor paralysis and to mitigate potential sex-dependent variations in susceptibility to the diet intervention. We assumed that the higher metabolic response observed in male mice 212223 would be associated with more pronounced brain responses 24. PS19 (n  18) and WT mice (n  19) were fed using standard laboratory chow (4 calories from fat and 18 from protein; Rodent NIH-3, Zeigler, USA) or HFD chow (60 calories from fat, 20 from protein and 20 from carbohydrates; D12492, Research diets, USA), from 12 to 36 weeks of age. We chose the diet containing 60 fat as HFD since majority of literatures that adopted HFD used this formula 13,252627, and it corresponds to a tolerable high-fat human diet 28. And we defined the mid-age of P301S mice as 3-9 months of age, given that only 20 of these mice survive beyond 12 months, primarily due to tau accumulations in the spinal cord leading to paralysis 19. Although WT mice have a significantly longer life expectancy, with their midlife typically occurring around 10 months, we chose the same age range for WT mice to align with PS19 mice 29. The mice were housed on a 12 h-light-dark cycle and had access to food and water ad libitum. During the controlled diet phase, body weight was measured every 2 weeks, and fasting blood glucose levels (6 h) were checked every 4 weeks with a glucose analyzer (Gluco Dr.TOP, AGM-4100, allmedicus, Korea). At the 36 weeks of age, behavioral tests and functional neuroimaging were performed. Subsequently, mice were deeply anesthetized with carbon dioxide after overnight fasting and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to get brain tissues.",

Both tests are based on the willingness of the mice to explore new environments. In the Y-maze test, a mouse was placed in a Y-shaped maze with three arms and allowed to freely explore the arms for 8 min. The movements were recorded using a data acquisition system (SMART video tracking software). An arm alternation was counted when a mouse entered a different arm with more than half of its body during three consecutive arm entries (triads). The percentage of alteration was obtained by dividing the number of alterations by the number of possible total triads (number of total arm entries -2) 30,32.\nThe novel object recognition test was conducted in three steps: familiarization -intersession interval -test session. For familiarization, a mouse was placed in the open field with two same objects and permitted to explore freely for 30 min. The animal was subsequently transferred to the home cage and stayed for 60 min. The test field was cleaned thoroughly using 70 ethanol, and one of the familiar objects was replaced by the novel one for a second trial. After an intersession interval, the mouse was replaced in the middle of arena with both familiar and novel objects, and allowed a free exploration for 10 min. The test session was monitored and recorded with a data acquisition system (SMART video tracking software, PanLab Harvard Apparatus, USA) to track the behavior. Data was analyzed in two parameters, novelty preference and discrimination index as described previously 31,32. In accordance with the established exclusion criteria 30,32, we omitted five PS19 mice that exhibited continuous jumping behavior during the Y-maze test. Additionally, one more PS19 mouse and five WT mice who displayed significant biases in exploratory behavior during the novel object recognition test were excluded for the analysis.",

First, the preprocessing pipeline in functional data included slice timing correction, de-spiking fMRI time course, image realignment for minor head motions during intra-scans, linear signal detrending for drift removal, voxel-wise time course normalization, and spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of a 0.2 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Additional preprocessing steps were involved for data clearing with regressing out 12 motion confounds (6 parameters  temporal derivatives) and bandpass filtering (0.01  f  0.3 Hz). Second, functional data was coregistered to an anatomic image, and then spatially normalized onto the Allen moue brain atlas using deformation parameters obtained between anatomic image and mouse brain atlas. Third, five different regions of interest (ROIs) in each hemisphere were defined on Allen mouse brain atlas: primary motor cortex (MOp), secondary motor cortex (MOs), and three subdivisions of the retrosplenial region (agranular, RSPagl; dorsal, RSPd, and ventral, RSPv). The resting-state time courses were extracted from these ROIs. Fourth, the cross-correlation coefficients were calculated for pairs of time courses to estimate the functional connectivity.\nThe structure-based diffusion properties were analyzed using diffusion-weighted imaging data with MRtrix3 software package 37, ANTs, and Matlab codes. First, the preprocessing pipeline in DTI data included the image realignment of diffusionweighted images to B 0 image to correct for head motion and eddy-current induced distortions, and voxel-wise diffusion tensor was calculated to generate the DTI-derived images (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD; axial diffusivity, AxD; radial diffusivity, RD) using multivariate linear fitting and diagonalization. Second, DTI-derived images were spatially normalized onto the Allen moue brain atlas. Third, two different ROIs including cingulum and corpus callosum in each hemisphere were defined based on the Allen mouse atlas, and then the averages of their diffusion properties were extracted within those ROIs.",

However, the weight gain stopped from 32 weeks of age in these mice regardless of diet type, which led to a significant discrepancy in body weight between PS-ND and WT-ND at 36 weeks (p  0.001). In WT mice, the weight gain was also distinct and persistent.

      "text": "This was the first study to conduct neuroimaging in addition to behavioral and tissue analyses to comprehensively examine the interaction between chronic HFD intake and tau pathology in a mouse model. Both WT and P301S mice fed the HFD showed distinct weight gain compared to the genotype-matched ND group, but the changes in brain function and structure differed significantly between the two genotypes. PS-HFD mice showed decreased integrity of the cingulum bundle in DTI-MRI compared to the genotype-matched ND group. However, there were no significant changes in markers of brain cells or tau protein in western blotting analysis of cortical and hippocampal tissue extracts. Conversely, marked pathological changes were detected in WT mice in response to HFD in addition to decreased memory performance in the novel object recognition test and changes in network connectivity in rs-fMRI. Significant decreases in expression of IR and its downstream substrate IRS-1 were observed in the cortex where levels of both NeuN and CD68 (markers of neurons and microglia with phagocytic activity, respectively 40) were also decreased. The levels of soluble tau in the cortex and pTau396 in the hippocampus were significantly reduced, while the levels of less-soluble AT8-positive pTau (S202T205) were higher in WT mice fed the HFD than the ND. Significantly decreased MBP levels and increased soluble Nf-L levels were observed in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively. These findings indicate that the susceptibility of the brain to chronic HFD intake is more profound in healthy mice than in those with the tau pathology.

CTX, cortex; HFD, high-fat diet; HPC, hippocampus; ND, normal diet; PS, P301S; WT, wild-type. chronic HFD feeding is consistent with previous studies on mice overexpressing human WT 43 and mutant tau: Tau22 (MAPT G272 V  P301S) and 3  TG-AD (APPswe, PSEN1 M146 V, and MAPT P301L) 252627 (Table 2). However, contradictory results have been reported 13,14. Increased levels of pTau were identified in another study using Tau22 male mice after 5 months of HFD intake from the age of 2 months 13. Tau22 mice develop tau pathology from 3-month-old by double mutant MAPT transgene under Thy1 promoter and have a metabolicsusceptible strain background, C57BL6J 44. These confounders are thought to bring out different brain responses to HFD from ours. However, the worsening effect of HFD in tau pathology was not replicable in the following study even though the same Tau22 mice model was used 27. In another study, moderately high calories diet (15.3 fat) that was fed for 8.5 months from 1.5 months of age increased the levels of aggregated and AT8 antibody-detectable pTau levels in the hippocampus of female P301S mice 14. This is the same mouse model as used in the present study, but fat composite of the diet was much lower, and the start time was earlier (at 1.5 months) than in our experiments. Considering that neurofibrillary tangles become prevalent around 6 months of age in P301S mice, and the earliest phenotypic features, such as gliosis, are evident from 3 months of age 19 1.5 months of difference is substantial. In addition, the weight gain of P301S mice in response to the high calories diet was 20 compared to the regular diet (4 fat), which is less than ours. These differences appear to cause our results to be different from the previous one. Further, the sex-specific susceptibility to obesity and obesogenic diet, as reported in humans 45, Tau22 transgenic mice 27, and C57BL6J WT mice 23,46,47 may also explain the discrepancy between the results of that previous study and our observations despite using the same animal model. With regard to sex-related differences in susceptibility to the effects of HFD intake, most previous studies have been performed on C57BL6J mice, and these have reported greater vulnerability to systemic metabolic effects and inflammation in males than females 23,27,46. However, there seems to be a disparity between the susceptibility of the brain and the systemic response. Although HFD-induced systemic effects seem to be greater in male mice, some changes in the brain have been exclusively identified in females, including decreased synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neurogenesis, and CD68 phagocytic activities 24,27. These observations suggest the need to study the sex-specific effects of HFD in P301S mice to understand whether the unique findings in this study were dependent on sex.\nDisorganization of the white matter was a significant finding related to HFD feeding in P301S mice in this study. In the cingulum, the reduced FA was accompanied by a decrease in AxD and increase in RD in PS-HFD mice. These observations suggest that both axonal and myelin damage may be contributing factors, as the decrease in AxD suggests axonal injury while the increase in RD suggests myelin damage 48,49. However, the altered white matter integrity was not confirmed by western blotting analysis of MBP and Nf-L, which are major constituents of myelin and axons, respectively, in the cortical and hippocampal extracts. The levels of these proteins were altered in WT mice in relation to HFD, but the mice did not show significant changes in DTI parameters of the white matter although neuronal degeneration was identified based on decreased NeuN levels. This discrepancy was likely because bulk extraction of the cortex and hippocampus is not appropriate to validate the changes in the corpus callosum or cingulum bundle, but rather is better for detection of changes in the gray matter. Therefore, future studies should consider incorporating region-specific and cellularspecific analyses, such as immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of these changes.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the effects of HFD feeding. Volumetric analyses in a previous study that used structural MRI demonstrated a reduction in brain volume with HFD intake in both 3  TG-AD and WT mice 50. With regard to white matter Fig. 5.

In humans, changes in white matter integrity in relation to obesity have been demonstrated via DTI 53,54. We observed such changes with increasing tract disruption in P301S mice but not in WT mice although the susceptibility of the brain to HFD was more profound in WT mice. These observations suggest that a brain envi-ronment with persistently abundant tau accumulation and aggregation in the neurons renders the white matter tracts more vulnerable to chronic HFD feeding in P301S mice in contrast to WT littermates. The current study did not provide a definitive explanation for the mechanism or significance of these changes. Considering that one of the mechanisms through which tau aggregates are neurotoxic is oxidative stress 55, it is plausible that the chronic stress environment confers a preconditioning effect that makes P301S mice more resistant to the impact of HFD 56. Further investigations to understand why P301S mice display resistance to the typical effects of HFD, as seen in WT mice, would be particularly intriguing.\nWT mice fed the HFD showed decreased levels of IR and its downstream substrate in this study, considered to indicate insulin resistance in the brain 57. However, noticeable and sustained changes in diet-specific glucose levels in the blood were not observed. Since we exclusively measured fasting glucose levels and did not conduct glucose and insulin tolerance tests, which provide precise information about systemic glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, the possibility that altered glucose homeostasis at the systemic level cannot be fully excluded in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, aside from their role in regulating peripheral metabolism, the insulin signaling pathways play physiological roles in the brain, including synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and microglial function 58,59. Therefore, it is possible that the observed changes in the neuronal marker, CD68, microglial phagocytic activity, and MBP in the cortex may have been at least partly due to the impairment of insulin signaling. It is noteworthy that the decreased NeuN expression in WT-HFD mice did not coincide with alterations in synaptic markers. While we successfully identified two synaptic proteins in the total lysates of the cortex and hippocampus and found no group-specific changes, conducting a more in-depth analysis within the synaptosome fraction could offer additional insights into HFD-specific synaptic modifications. Interestingly, the hippocampus showed marked increases in murine pTau S202T205 levels in the less-soluble fraction of WT-HFD mice up to the same level as in P301S mice. Increased tau phosphorylation at these epitopes is frequently observed within the aggregated tau proteins that mainly constitute the neurofibrillary tangles, a pathological hallmark of AD 60. We speculated that the increased pTau in the lesssoluble fraction of WT mice may be involved in the hippocampus-related brain dysfunction in WT-HFD mice. Changes in functional connectivity centered on the retrosplenial cortical network and diminished object recognition memory were identified in these mice, both of which are related to the hippocampus 31,61. Our findings regarding the selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to HFD-related tau pathology in WT mice are important as pTau is frequently accumulated in the hippocampus in aged individuals, defined as primary age-related tauopathy 62.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "This study provides novel insights into the interaction between HFD and tau pathology in terms of changes in brain function and structure. Significantly decreased white matter integrity in the cingulum was observed in P301S mice fed the HFD. In contrast, WT mice showed marked changes in functional connectivity, recognition memory, and protein expression of insulin signaling molecules and various brain cell markers in the cortex and hippocampus in relation to HFD intake. Decreases in soluble pTau and increases in aggregable pTau were prominent in the hippocampus. Our observations suggest that chronic tau pathology blunts the impact of HFD-induced obesity in the gray matter and increases its effects in the white matter tracts. Our findings underscore the necessity for a tailored approach in managing obesity-linked risks. This tailored strategy may prioritize the management of white matter changes in AD patients with high tau pathology burden, while implementing a comprehensive approach for healthy individuals. Within this framework, rs-fMRI and DTI can be valuable imaging biomarkers for assessing the impact of a HFD and monitoring the response to treatment.",

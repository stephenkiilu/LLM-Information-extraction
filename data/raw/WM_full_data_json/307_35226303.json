    "abstract": "Background The blood biomarker neurofilament light (NFL) is one of the most widely used for monitoring Alzheimers disease (AD). According to recent research, a higher NFL plasma level has a substantial predictive value for cognitive deterioration in AD patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI-based approach for detecting neurodegeneration, white matter (WM) disruption, and synaptic damage. There have been few studies on the relationship between plasma NFL and WM microstructure integrity. Aims The goal of the current study is to assess the associations between plasma levels of NFL, CSF total tau, phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181), and amyloid-β (Aβ) with WM microstructural alterations. Methods We herein have investigated the cross-sectional association between plasma levels of NFL and WM microstructural alterations as evaluated by DTI in 92 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provided by Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. We analyzed the potential association between plasma NFL levels and radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AxD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) in each region of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) atlas, using simple linear regression models stratified by age, sex, and APOE ε4 genotype. Results Our findings demonstrated a significant association between plasma NFL levels and disrupted WM microstructure across the brain. In distinct areas, plasma NFL has a negative association with FA in the fornix, fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, internal capsule, and corona radiata and a positive association with RD, AxD, and MD values in sagittal stratum, corpus callosum, fronto-occipital fasciculus, corona radiata, internal capsule, thalamic radiation, hippocampal cingulum, fornix, and cingulum. Lower FA and higher RD, AxD, and MD values are related to demyelination and degeneration in WM. Conclusion Our findings revealed that the level of NFL in the blood is linked to WM alterations in MCI patients. Plasma NFL has the potential to be a biomarker for microstructural alterations. However, further longitudinal studies are necessary to validate the predictive role of plasma NFL in cognitive decline.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and causing a negative impact on the health care system 1. Structural changes occur in the brain mainly with aging before AD manifestation. These pathological events include structural changes, depositions of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) protein aggregation. Severe cognitive declines are detected using diagnostic methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET) assays 1. Since the CSF collection via lumbar puncture (LP) is invasive and unsuitable for common application 2, there is an unmet demand for cost-effective, blood-based biomarkers with minimal invasiveness 3.\nBiomarkers are essential in disease diagnosis as well as monitoring progression and response to disease-modifying therapies. Accordingly, neurofilament light (NFL) is one of the neural cytoskeletons scaffolding proteins and is considered a sensitive marker of axonal damage 4. Recent advancements support the role of serum NFL as a biomarker for cognitive decline in both AD and Parkinsons diseases 5. Increased NFL levels have been linked to future brain tissue loss, decreased brain metabolism, and cognitive impairment 6. Furthermore, previous investigations indicated that increased NFL plasma levels might predict cognitive deterioration in individuals with MCI and AD patients 3,678.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows in vivo non-invasive measurement of neurodegeneration, white matter (WM) disruption, and synaptic damage in patients with AD 9. Emerging research points to WM changes as a marker for pathological significance, which could be a promising target for early dementia diagnosis 10. Early accumulation of CSF and plasma P-tau has been reported in the corpus callosum of Alzheimers brain, which is also associated with WM decline 11,12.\nThere is not enough evidence of whether plasma NFL is associated with WM microstructure in people with MCI, and owing to the potential predictive role of NFL for AD 13, in the current research, we carried out a cross-sectional assessment to clarify the association between plasma NFL levels with DTI-detected microstructural changes of WM in the MCI patients. As recent studies have shown plasma NFL as a biomarker of AD 3,6,14, we aimed to examine the association of WM changes and NFL in the early stages before reaching AD.",

DTI scans underwent normalization using the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) nu_correct tool (www. bic. mni. mcgill. ca softw are). non-brain tissues were removed by the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from FSL 16. The T1-weighted image was aligned to a version of the Col-ins27 brain template 17 using FSLs flirt 18. The Col-ins27 brain was zero-padded to have a cubic isotropic image size (220  220  220 1 mm 3 ) and then down-sampled (110  110  110 2 mm 3 ) to be more similar to the Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) resolution. A single diffusion tensor was modeled at each voxel in the brain 19. Scalar anisotropy and diffusivity maps were obtained from the resulting diffusion tensor eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, λ3). Then Fractional anisotropy (FA), which shows directional dependence of the diffusion process and mean diffusivity (MD), Radial diffusivity (RD), and Axial diffusivity (AxD), which reflects the amount of diffusion were calculated. Lower FA and higher RD, AxD, MD are related to demyelination and degeneration in WM. We used a previously mentioned shared information-based elastic registration algorithm to allocate the FA image from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) DTI atlas 20 to each subject 21. To prevent label intermixing, we used nearest-neighbor interpolation to apply the deformation to the stereotaxic JHU Eve WM atlas labels (http: cmrm. med. jhmi. edu cmrm atlas human_ data file Atlas Explanation2.htm). This placed the atlas ROIs in the same coordinate space as our DTI maps. Then, the average FA and MD were calculated within the boundaries of each ROI mask of each subject. Tensor-based spatial statistics 22 were also performed, and the mean FA in the ROIs was extracted along with the skeleton. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), an automated, observer-independent approach for assessing FA in the major white matter tracts on a voxel-wise basis across groups of subjects was performed according to the protocols outlined by the ENIGMA-DTI group (http: enigma. loni. ucla. edu wpcon tent uploa ds 2012 06 ENIGMA_ TBSS_ proto col. pdf). Briefly, all subjects were registered to the ENIGMA-DTI template in International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) space, a stereotaxic probabilistic white matter atlas, and standard TBSS steps were performed to project individual FA maps onto the skeletonized ENIGMA-DTI template.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "There are limited reports on the association of NFL and WM structures across age, sex, and APOE4 carrier in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Our results showed significant associations between plasma NFL and CSF total tau and P-tau181 were independent of being APOE ε4 carrier and age. CSF total tau and CSF P-tau181 were significantly associated with plasma NFL in both men and women. The marginal significant association of CSF total tau and plasma NFL in men can be due to the small sample size (P value  0.066).\nOur analyses showed a significant association between plasma NFL levels and abnormal WM microstructural in various brain areas. The results suggest the associations of NFL with WM might be more region-specific in APOE4 carrier versus non-carrier as well as in men versus women. In this analysis, we included individuals with baseline MCI and the significant association of NFL with MWI in MCI patients might suggest the use of this non-invasive plasma biomarker to detect MCI before progress to AD, which also tracks well with. CSF levels of P-tau and P-tau181. Based on our findings, APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers, women and men, and patients with an age of higher and lower than 73.2 had an association between plasma NFL and WM microstructural changes in different regions. There were WM region-specific associations between NFL and AxD in APOE4 carrier versus non-carriers, suggesting a possible discrepancy in WM structural change in APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers. Further studies are required to shed light on this finding. As previous studies demonstrated the WM microstructural difference associated with APOE ε4 23. APOE ε4 carriers had lower FA values in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum compared to noncarriers in cognitively healthy individuals which emphasize on effect of APOE ε4 on WM microstructural changes in normal aging 24.\nNon-invasive biomarkers with screening ability of change in cognition state and degenerative nervous system are required. As a non-invasive, and cost-effective, and accessible blood-based biomarker, NFL which tracks well with CSF markers can be of use to screen patients for further imaging studies 25. Moreover, cognitive tests might not be sensitive enough to screen cognitive impairment. Therefore, identifying non-invasive plasma biomarkers like NFL that can track well with microstructural changes and neurodegeneration in both grey and white matters can be of use in clinical settings and research 26,27. Our findings revealed a significant correlation between the plasma NFL with altered WM microstructural changes in widespread brain regions. Plasma NFL has a negative correlation with FA and a positive correlation with RD, AxD, and MD values in the cingulum, hippocampal cingulum, corona radiate, internal capsule, fronto-occipital fasciculus, frontooccipital fasciculus, sagittal stratum, corpus callosum, thalamic radiation, and fornix. Similarly, with these findings, Spotorno et al. indicated that higher plasma NFL level is associated with lower FA value in superior longitudinal fasciculus, the fronto-occipital fasciculus, the anterior thalamic radiation, and the dorsal cingulum bundle in frontotemporal dementia 28. WM differences between MCI patients and healthy controls are primarily observed in the corpus callosum along with limbic pathways, including the fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus 29. Crucially, these signature regions are involved in the WM changes due to AD. Indeed, alterations in the WM integrity in these regions are associated with disease progression from the early stages to the late stages of AD 30. Also, an investigation on the patients with autosomal dominant AD (patients with a mutation in Aβ production genes), showed that the serum level of NFL correlates with lower FA and higher RD, AxD, and MD which is in line with our study 31,32.\nBy investigating diffusion metrics, information about the WMs different specifications can be obtained from DTI values. However, the exact relationship between these four values of FA, RD, AxD, MD, and the physiopathology mechanisms of AD has not been completely understood.\nCommonly, lower FA, and higher RD, AxD, and MD in relation to demyelination and degeneration in WM have been reported 33. Several studies have reported the association between CSF levels of NFL and WM damage in both MCI and AD 34353637. In people without cognitive impairment, the CSF level of NFL is associated with compromised WM microstructure. However, ADNI cross-sectional data with a large sample size revealed significantly higher plasma NFL levels in the patients with MCI than cognitively healthy individuals 38,39. Furthermore, we observed that plasma levels of NFL have a strong correlation with MMSE scores in APOE ε4 carriers, men, and patients with age higher than 73.2. Our outcomes demonstrated that the plasma level of the NFL might be an accurate biomarker for reflecting the cognitive status of patients in preclinical stages of AD. Moreover, plasma NFL was associated with more WM regions in APOE ε4 carriers with almost similar regional patterns of associations seen in the younger age. Moreover, the associations of NFL and WM regions in non-carrier APOE4 were similar to the regions with significant NFL associations in older age. These results suggest that NFL might detect region-specific changes of WM specific to APOE4 carrier state and age 40,41. Further investigations are necessary to replicate these results. The plasma levels of NFL are associated with age and APOE ε4 carrier state, two important risk factors of cognitive decline and can be used as a screening tool to detect cognitive decline in the early stage 3,13,42. We showed that NFL is associated with WM regions in both men and women with MCI. Some studies recently have shown a cognitive decline in men 43,44. This is while most epidemiological studies have reported a more cognitive decline in women than men. Our results suggest that choosing biomarkers, and sex-stratified analytical approaches can shed further light on cognitive decline in men 45.\nSimilar to Mattson et al. our results revealed higher plasma levels of NFL are significantly associated with total tau and P-tau181 in CSF 6. We did not find any significant association between NFL and Aβ. Similarly, a study has shown that 80 of individuals with Aβ aggregation have no cognitive problems 42 suggesting tracking NFL levels with tauopathy at the early stage of cognitive decline 464748.",

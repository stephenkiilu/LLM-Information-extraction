    "abstract": "Objectives: Agitation and aggression are common in dementia and pre-dementia. The dementia risk syndrome mild behavioral impairment (MBI) includes these symptoms in the impulse dyscontrol domain. However, the neural circuitry associated with impulse dyscontrol in neurodegenerative disease is not well understood. The objective of this work was to investigate if regional micro-and macro-structural brain properties were associated with impulse dyscontrol symptoms in older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers disease (AD). Methods: Clinical, neuropsychiatric, and T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data from 80 individuals with and 123 individuals without impulse dyscontrol were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess if impulse dyscontrol was related to regional DTI and volumetric parameters. Results: Impulse dyscontrol was present in 17 of participants with NC, 43 with MCI, and 66 with AD. Impulse dyscontrol was associated with: (1) lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and greater mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the fornix; (2) lesser FA and greater radial diffusivity in the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; (3) greater axial diffusivity in the cingulum; (4) greater axial and radial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus; (5) gray matter atrophy, specifically, lower cortical thickness in the parahippocampal gyrus. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that well-established atrophy patterns of AD are prominent in the presence of impulse dyscontrol, even when disease status",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a validated neurobehavioral syndrome that describes the later life emergence of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) as an at-risk state for incident cognitive decline and dementia. 1 These NPS have been suggested to be an index manifestation of dementia. 2345678910 MBI captures preclinical and prodromal disease symptoms and is associated with known dementia biomarkers including amyloid-β, 11 tau, 12,13 neurofilament light, 14 brain atrophy, 15,16 and Alzheimers disease (AD) risk genes. 2,17 Impulse dyscontrol is one of the MBI domains and includes behavioral symptoms of agitationaggression, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior amongst others.\nThe clinical manifestations of MBI impulse dyscontrol including agitation, aggression, and irritability are common in dementia and are associated with caregiver stress and poorer outcomes. 18,19 In a population-based study of older adults ranging from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cross-sectional assessment of NPS using the neuropsychiatric inventory found impulse dyscontrol symptoms to be the most common domain with frequencies of 17.2 in NC and 33.8 in MCI. 20 A concurrent study in a cognitive neurology clinic sample assessed MBI domains in those with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and MCI 21 and reported the frequency of impulse dyscontrol in both groups being greater than 50. 21 Longitudinal analysis of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center cohort described phases of NPS emergence in advance of dementia with symptoms of irritabilitylability emerging in the first wave of pre-dementia NPS, and agitation emerging in the second wave. 22 Subsequent analysis of the same population demonstrated that NPS emerged in advance of cognitive symptoms in 59 of dementia participants, including 30 of those who developed AD.\nFor impulse dyscontrol symptoms, irritability emerged before dementia in 38 of cases (21 before MCI), agitation before dementia in 26 of cases (13 before MCI), and motor disturbance before dementia in 6 of cases (3 before MCI). 23 These symptoms of impulse dyscontrol are common in preclinical and prodromal disease, are associated with greater risk of incident cognitive decline and dementia and represent clinically significant symptoms often requiring pharmacological intervention. Further exploration of impulse dyscontrol is warranted.\nResearch has assessed neuroimaging correlates of agitation, aggression, and impulse dyscontrol in dementia but to a lesser extent in predementia groups. Agitationaggression in MCI and AD has been associated with atrophy in fronto-limbic regions, the right posterior cingulate, and left hippocampus. 24 Aberrant motor behavior symptoms have been associated with atrophy in the right basal nuclei and frontal cortex. 25 Furthermore, reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior cingulum 26 The objective of this study was to assess white matter and volumetric parameters in a priori selected brain regions in association with symptoms of impulse dyscontrol in individuals with NC, MCI, and AD. Based on our literature review, the large white matter tracts assessed include the cingulum, fornix, superior frontooccipital fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus (Figure 1 27 ). Volumetric analysis included the hippocampus, caudal and rostral anterior cingulate, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (Figure 2 28 ). We hypothesized that symptoms of impulse GILL ET AL. dyscontrol would be associated with decreased white matter integrity in the cingulum and with atrophy patterns in frontolimbic structures.",

Participants were excluded for: (1) missing baseline DTI data; (2) missing NPI-Q scores (i.e., no impulse dyscontrol score); (3) quantitative MRI analysis classified as Fail or Hippocampus only by visual quality control by the UCSF core lab; or (4) missing cognitive composite scores.

Outputs included cortical thickness, surface area, and volumetric measurements within regions labeled by the 2010 Desikan-Killany and 2009 Destrieux atlas. Additional information on UCSF FreeSurfer methods is also available elsewhere. 34 In order to control for intracranial volume (ICV) differences, we computed a normalization factor by averaging ICV of the whole sample and dividing it by individual ICV. This ratio was multiplied with all cortical and subcortical volume variables. 35 Figures 1 and2 show the a priori selected brain regions in association with symptoms of impulse dyscontrol.

Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to investigate univariate associations between patient characteristics and impulse dyscontrol symptoms. Linear mixed effect (LME) models were used to assess if impulse dyscontrol was associated with DTI parameters. White matter regions included in this analysis were the cingulum, cingulum (hippocampus), fornix, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus. Fixed effects included impulse dyscontrol, regions, impulse dyscontrol by regions, disease status, age, sex, psychotropic drug use, and education. Random effects included the hemisphere of the structure (leftright) and subjects. In the LME models, our primary predictors of interest were impulse dyscontrol, white matter regions, and impulse dyscontrol by regions. Similar analyses were conducted to test if impulse dyscontrol presence was related to volumetric measures, where regions included the hippocampus, caudal and rostral anterior cingulate, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Simple effect of MBI on the ROIs after LME modeling are reported. With seven different LME models in total (4 for DTI, 3 for volumetric measures), significance level was adjusted to 0.01 (instead of 0.05) to minimize inflation in type 1 error.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, the relationship between structural neuroimaging markers and impulse dyscontrol symptoms was explored across cognitive categories. In those with NC, MCI, and AD, both white and gray matter differences were identified in individuals with impulse dyscontrol emphasizing the importance of these symptoms in neurodegenerative disease and supporting the notion of behavioral sequelae of brain structural changes across the cognitive spectrum.\nIn interpreting DTI parameters, reduced FA and increased MD, AxD, and RD are associated with impaired white matter integrity as an outcome of several factors including cell death and altered myelination, amongst others. 31,36 In this study, as shown by the altered DTI parameters, lower white matter integrity in tracts including the cingulum, fornix, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus was associated with impulse dyscontrol. To our knowledge, Tighe et al. 26 published the only DTI study to date that reported lower FA of the anterior cingulum to be associated with symptoms of agitation and irritability. While differences in the FA of the cingulum were not significant in our study, the cingulum was still implicated with greater AxD in individuals with impulse dyscontrol symptoms.\nThe cingulum is an important tract that connects frontal, parietal, and medial temporal regions, including several limbic structures, and microstructural changes in this tract have been associated with MCI and AD. 37 Furthermore, a recent study identified altered DTI parameters in the cingulum in early-stage AD. 38 In another ADNI study of participants with preclinical AD (amyloid and tau positive), irritability predicted hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex 2 years later, supporting the role of irritability as a preclinical AD marker. 39 Our study extends the evidence base for the cingulum as a potential early neuroimaging marker, which can show changes in DTI parameters in individuals with impulse dyscontrol symptoms in advance of dementia.\nWith significant differences in all diffusion parameters, the fornix was another important tract that was associated with symptoms of impulse dyscontrol. The relationship of the fornix and NPSs in predementia and dementia populations is largely unexplored. However, there is evidence supporting neurodegeneration in the fornix predicting degree of memory impairment and the likelihood of progression to AD. 40,41 A reduced fornix FA is one of the earliest MRI abnormalities observed in individuals at risk of AD 42 and has been explored as a treatment target using deep brain stimulation for mild AD. 43 In a recent study, damaged white matter integrity of the fornix was also associated with reduced resting-state functional connectivity of the hippocampus in individuals with MCI and AD. 44 Observing fornix impairment in association with impulse dyscontrol highlights NPSs as part of the early disease process. The cingulum, fornix, and fronto-occipital fasciculus tracts are all important for connections between hippocampus to the hypothalamus and connecting orbitofrontal areas to the occipital regions. These white matter differences combined with gray matter atrophy in the parahippocampal gyrus provide evidence that the well-established atrophy patterns in AD 45,46 are also prominent in the presence of behavioral symptoms, even after adjustment for disease status.\nThese findings also suggest that white matter damage is more prominent than gray matter atrophy, in line with past literature, which has determined that microstructural white matter changes precede gray matter atrophy. 47 With the goal to identify the neural correlates associated with the MBI impulse dyscontrol domain, the results suggest that the fronto-striatal network plays a key role in regulating these behaviors. Rosenberg et al. 48 identified that the agitation circuit consists of the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and insula.\nSince these regions associated with agitation mapped onto the salience network, the authors proposed that increased connectivity within this network could explain agitation in individuals. Similarly, we observed the cingulum, fronto-occipital tracts, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, and parahippocampal gyrus as key regions associated with impulse dyscontrol. Some of the regions from this study also overlap with the agitation circuits previously identified 48 providing evidence of brain changes similar to core AD pathology, which can precede cognitive symptoms or dementia.\nBeyond differences in neural correlates, we also observed group differences in the sex of the participants in our study. More men had symptoms of impulse dyscontrol present. There is some evidence that suggests males have greater impulse control behaviors, 49 however, other studies have identified NPS such as, disinhibition, verbal aggression, and irritability to be more common in females. 505152 These differences across studies could be an outcome of variations based on recruitment strategy, study design, sample analyzed, diagnostic criteria, and the instruments used to measure NPS. The higher proportion of males with impulse dyscontrol symptoms adds to the evidence base. However, further research is required explore sex differences in association with NPS.\nThere are several strengths of this study. and link these to dementia risk. Additionally, our sample primarily consisted of individuals in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD-dementia-identifying patterns of micromacro-structural changes at earlier stages could support future prediction models and enable early patient identification.\nThere are some limitations of this study. MBI case detection was approximated using transformations of the NPI-Q. Since NPI-Q measures symptoms within 1-month range, it is possible that we captured transient symptoms that may have resolved, thus decreasing diagnostic specificity. Studies have shown inflated MBI prevalence using transformed scores 21,53 in comparison to the use of the MBI checklist (MBI-C), which is the validated a priori case ascertainment instrument developed for MBI. 54 The MBI-C has demonstrated ability to serve as a proxy marker for older adults with subtle cognitive changes or early neurodegenerative disease. 3,55 Thus, diagnostic sensitivity of this approach may also be a limitation, as the whole breadth of MBI impulse dyscontrol, validated by network meta-analysis 56 is not captured by the NPI-Q. Future studies that use MBI-C should further investigate the neural correlates associated with MBI impulse dyscontrol and other domains to verify our results. Additionally, ADNI excludes patients with psychiatric illness (some of which may actually be prodromal dementia symptoms) 10 or those with severe NPS. Thus, the sample included in this study might underappreciate the extent of NPS in the preclinical and prodromal population. Other datasets should be explored for further validation of our results.",

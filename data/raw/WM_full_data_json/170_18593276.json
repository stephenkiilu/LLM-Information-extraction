    "abstract": "Mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene have been recently demonstrated as a cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-immunoreactive neuronal inclusion (FTD-U). Neuropathologic, clinical, and neuroimaging features associated with PGRN mutations have been carefully described. No studies on asymptomatic subjects carrying pathogenetic PGRN mutations are available yet. These would be crucial for establishing the timing of brain changes and bringing new insight into disease pathogenesis and disease course. The aim of this study was to evaluate structural brain morphology using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in asymptomatic carriers of PGRN delCACT mutation belonging to a fourgeneration FTLD pedigree (mean age, 37.0 Ϯ 12.0). The evaluation of the family proband presenting with progressive nonfluent aphasia at 53 years of age, revealed left frontotemporal hypoperfusion and atrophy. VBM analysis of gray and white matter reductions revealed no differences between asymptomatic carriers (n ϭ 7) and controls (n ϭ 15), and between no-carriers (n ϭ 10) and controls (p Ͻ 0.001). DTI analysis revealed a reduction in fractional anisotropy in healthy PGRN mutation carriers in the left uncinate fasciculus, connecting the orbito-frontal regions to the temporal pole, and in the left inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, connecting the parieto-occipital cortex to the dorsolateral frontal cortex (p Ͻ 0.001). No significant difference in fractional anisotropy between no-carriers and controls was found. Our data indicate loss of white matter integrity as an early preclinical feature in familial FTD that might antedate the onset of specific neurologic features. Alteration of fiber tracts within the perisylvian language network might represent the early hallmark of subsequent aphasia onset. The study of other pedigrees of asymptomatic PGRN mutation carriers is warranted.",

      "text": "U NDERSTANDING THE TIME OF ONSET of neurodegenerative dementias is crucial for the design of clinical studies, for the prevention of these conditions as well as for a deeper insight into pathophysiology. 1 Few studies are already available on presymptomatic stages in subjects at risk for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), these representing a privileged point of view to address this issue. 1,2 FTD is often familial (25-50), usually with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. 3 It is genetically complex, with linkage studies revealing FTD loci and genes on chromosome 3, 4 chromosome 9, 5678 and chromosome 17. 9,10 Initial genetic studies on familial FTD with evidence of linkage at 17q21 identified mutations in the gene encoding microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), and up to now over 35 mutations have been described (www.molgen.ua.ac. beADMutation). 11 However, the absence of obvious MAPT mutations in tau-negative FTD-17 families suggested that a different gene was involved. Recently, in many of these families the disease was explained by mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene that mapped approximately 1.7 Mb centromeric of the MAPT locus. 12,13 The PGRN gene encodes a secreted multifunctional growth factor involved in development, wound repair, and inflammation. 14 Patients with PGRN mutations do not exhibit taupathology, but ubiquitin-immunoreactive TDP-43 positive neuronal cytoplasmatic and intranuclear inclusions. 15,16 In the last few months, different studies have carefully described the neuropathological and clinical features of pa-tients with PGRN gene variations, 15,1718192021222324 and the recent advances of neuroimaging techniques have enabled researchers to describe cerebral gray matter changes in these patients by voxel based morphometry (VBM). 25 In addition, different studies have demonstrated the usefulness of VBM in describing brain changes in FTD and among FTD subtypes, i.e., frontal variant FTD, semantic dementia, or progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). 262728 Notwithstanding, even if VBM reliability has been demonstrated in evaluating gray matter abnormalities, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides more subtle information about white matter tissue composition, 25,29,30 also in studying FTD. 28 In the present work, we provided VBM and DTI analyses in asymptomatic carriers of a genetic PGRN variation belonging to a four generation FTD pedigree. One affected proband came to our observation with clinical features of PNFA. This family gave us the unique opportunity to investigate whether structural brain changes, in either gray or white matter, could be detected in healthy PGRN mutation carriers. This is the first neuroimaging evidence of specific alterations of fiber tracts connecting language related brain regions in asymptomatic subjects bearing PGRN genetic variation.\nThese studies are strategically important since they might contribute to shedding light on the natural history of the disease and to highlighting when and where the pathologic process takes place.",

Herein, a large family with the proband affected by PNFA associated with PGRN mutation was studied.\nTwo neurologists (B.B. and A.P.) independently examined 18 family members and each subject underwent a somatic and neurologic evaluation. A standardized neuropsychological assessment including global cognitive evaluation and language examination was performed also in unaffected subjects to ensure that cognitive performance was within normal range. The diagnosis of the index case of PNFA was made according to current clinical criteria. 31,32 In the pedigree construction, the family members who had died or who did not undergo examination were judged to have possible dementia on the basis of the interview with their relatives.\nInformed consent was obtained for blood collection from venous puncture and genetic analysis. Peripheral blood was collected from the index case and from most of his unaffected living siblings. Clinical data were blinded to genetic status. The screening of MAPT gene sequence did not yield any mutation (data not shown). A group of 15 (5 males, 10 females, mean age Ϯ standard deviation SD ϭ 57.3 Ϯ 3.8) healthy subjects was previously recruited among spouses or relatives of FTD patients evaluated for clinical and research aims in our center, and included as normal controls for MRI comparisons.\nThe work was compliant with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the local Ethics Committee of our hospital.

All the 12 exons plus exon 0 of PGRN and at least 30 base pairs (bp) of their flanking introns were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were designed to optimize denaturing highperformance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) conditions, following previously provided primer pairs (see Appendix 1). 12,13 dHPLC method was adopted to screen a large sample of FTD patients, among whose the present family was identified.\nFor exons 0, 1, 6, 7, 11, and 12, PCRs were carried out by mixing 30 pmol of primers, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 ng of genomic DNA with 1U TaqGold DNA Polymerase (Applera) in a final volume of 50 L. For exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 to 10, PCRs were carried out by mixing 30 pmol of primers, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgSO 4 , and 20 ng of genomic DNA with 2.5U TaqGold DNA Optimase (Transgenomic, Crewe, UK) in a final volume of 50 L.\nAll PCR programs were established by using a Touchdown approach, the annealing temperature ranging from 58C to 66C.\nThe PCR reactions were analyzed on 2 agarose to verify the size of the PCR products.\nPreliminary dHPLC was performed on the Wave  nucleic acid fragment analysis system (Transgenomic, Santa Clara, CA), an automated instrumentation equipped with a DNASep column. Each PCR product (5 L) was loaded on the Wave  instrument and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient consisting of buffer A (0.1 M triethylamine acetate; TEAA) and buffer B (0.1 M TEAA in 25 acetonitrile) at a constant flow rate of 0.9 mLmin. Specific values of the gradient ranges and the column temperature required for optimal resolution of each amplicon were determined by the WaveMaker software (Transgenomic) based on the sequence. A Mutation Standard (Transgenomic) was run in parallel, to ensure the best performance of the instrument for mutation detection. The elution profiles were recorded and analyzed by Navigator TM Software (Transgenomic).\nSamples with an altered dHPLC profile were purified with Microcon Centrifugal filter Devices (Amicon Bioseparation-Millipore, Bedford, MA) and sequenced. Sequencing was performed in duplicate from purified PCR on the 310 DNA sequencer ABI Prism (Applera Biosystems, Italy), according to the manufacturers instructions.

By his 53rd year, the patient presented progressive dysarthria along with orofacial apraxia. At his first clinical evaluation, 2 years after onset, neurologic examination revealed slightly brisk tendon reflexes, snout reflex, and a mild right akinetic extrapyramidal syndrome (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS-III ϭ 5108).\nAachener aphasia test showed a profile of nonfluent aphasia, associated with a severe disorder of writing, reading and repetition. Comprehension was preserved at single word level, but he had difficulty understanding complex syntactic structures. The errors in writing, reading, and repetition were predominantly letter substitution, deletions, and transpositions. In addition, there was speech apraxia, agrammatism, severe articulatory difficulties, and anomic pauses. The patient showed oral deficits in verb naming (his writing was not testable).\nNonverbal intelligence, attention and drawing abilities were normal. Language impairment prevented an evaluation of verbal memory, but on short and long visuo-spatial memory tasks the patient had a normal score. Semantic knowledge was preserved (see Appendix 2).\nIn summary, the index case showed slowly progressive nonfluent aphasia associated with speech apraxia, agrammatism, syntactic comprehension deficits, agraphia, orofacial apraxia along with verbal naming deficit. This picture fulfilled current clinical criteria for PNFA, a subtype of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). 31,32 Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed, total tau level being fairly higher than normal range (504.9 pgmL, normal range Ͻ 400 pgmL), and Abeta42 level being within normal range (776.9, normal range Ͼ 500 pgmL). Cognitive deficits at disease presentation were consistent with regional brain dysfunction as shown by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan (Fig. 2A).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The two major unmet issues in familial neurodegenerative disorders such as FTD are when and where the degenerative process starts. This topic is raised by the common observation that familial FTD usually becomes symptomatic at mature age, although the mutated protein is already present during brain developmental stages.\nIn this study, by the combination of genetic and imaging analyses, we demonstrated that cerebral white matter abnormalities occur much earlier than the symptomatic onset in PGRN mutation carriers. The extensive clinical, and biologic evaluation of the proband affected by PNFA identified a pathogenic PGRN exon 8 delCACT mutation. Following analyses in the wide pedigree of clinically asymptomatic siblings bearing the same deletion were addressed to investigating possible brain structural changes. The reduction in fractional anisotropy revealed the selective involvement of left hemispheric white matter. Conversely, we did not find any early structural change in cerebral gray matter in the same family carriers, as measured by VBM.\nThis study confirms and expands previous findings showing that white matter abnormalities represent an early feature in FTD and in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum. 28,33 Future biologic studies are crucial to understand the role of PGRN in central nervous system, and the effect of PGRN pathogenetic mutations that might led to an underlying axonal transport defect inherent to PGRN haploinsufficiency.\nIn particular, we have shown differences in the involvement of fiber tracts according to behavioral and aphasia variants of FTD. The pattern of gray matter atrophy in patients with PNFA has also been previously reported, indicating left inferior frontal and insular atrophy. 47 (see text for details).\nHere, we provide the first evidence of genotype-phenotype effect in preclinical phase, demonstrating that the PGRN gene variation is associated with selective axonal loss in fiber tracts belonging to the language network. Only one previous study reported brain atrophy by means of VBM in patients with PGRN mutations in comparison with FTD patients not bearing this genetic condition, the former being associated with a specific and severe frontal, temporal, and parietal atrophy. 25 In the present study of asymptomatic carriers, we demonstrated the involvement of fiber bundles passing into the extreme capsule via the temporal stem, namely the left uncinate fasciculus, the arcuate fasciculus, and the left inferior frontooccipital fasciculus. 38 All these bundles represent the connecting network of the perisilvian language system. 39 A recent comparative work in monkeys has underlined the possible crucial importance of the temporal stem in the pathogenesis of conductional aphasia; the authors observed bidirectional pathways leading from the lower prefrontal region (Brocas area precursor) to the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus by way of the extreme capsule. 40 In particular, the uncinate fasciculus is a ventral limbic pathway that links the rostral superior temporal gyrus important for sound recognition as well as the medial temporal area relevant in recognition memory, and the orbital, medial and prefrontal cortices involved in emotion, inhibition and self-regulation, or understanding emotional aspects of the nature of sounds. 40,41 The inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, a large association bundle of fibers connecting the infero-lateral and dorso-lateral frontal cortex with posterior temporal and occipital lobe, is crucial for language semantic processing. 42,43 Furthermore, the arcuate fasciculus, connecting auditory associative, parietal and inferior prefrontal cortices, represents one of the classic fiber pathways within the traditional model of language organization. 39 Different studies have addressed the question about the genotype-phenotype correlation in FTD patients with PGRN mutations. All PGRN mutations that cause FTD, do so by a common haploinsuffiency mechanism. 12,13 However, as MAPT mutations, a high clinical variability among patients has been described covering different phenotypes over FTD spectrum. Clinical variability has also been recently reported within patients belonging to another large pedigree and carrying an insertion in exon 9 of PGRN gene. 44 Different explanations may be claimed, such as the interaction of other modifier genes or environmental background.\nHowever, the present results on asymptomatic carriers belonging to the same family seem to establish a continuum between the proband and the mutation carriers, the language pathway being primarily affected. In fact, the fractional anisotropy abnormality in unaffected individuals interestingly parallels the pattern of hypoperfusion in the index case affected by PNFA.\nNotwithstanding, it is worth noting that some of the kindreds with PGRN mutations have a strikingly similar clinical phenotype, 45 and consistent lateralization and left cerebral hemisphere predilection. As suggested by Mesulam and colleagues, 45 it is likely that the initial cerebral involvement of this PGRN mutation is due to the interaction with a specific genetic background that makes the language network particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. An additional explanation may account for the possibility of PGRN variants in the normal allele influencing expression levels and distribution of the wild-type functional protein. Alternatively, the language network may harbor a developmental or acquired susceptibility to damage caused by this PGRN mutation. 45 It is however remarkable that the cognitive and behavioral symptoms described in clinically defined FTD patients carrying PGRN genetic variations mirror a widespread neuropathology that eventually spreads beyond the initial area of preferential vulnerability. Only the evaluation of preclinical carriers with different PGRN pathogenetic mutations can elucidate the underpinnings of the disease, the correlation between such PGRN mutations and brain areas of vulnerability as well as the associated factors that drive mutation penetrance.\nThe PGRN functions in neurons are not still elucidated and need further investigation. The basal gene expression of this growth factor suggests that it is multifunctional with important roles in several neuronal signaling pathways. 14,46 It is likely that the lack of PGRN production leads to neurodegeneration, the precise mechanisms being not yet known. The present findings suggest that PGRN might have a role in axonal transport, like tau protein, since its genetic variation is linked to white matter impairment.\nSome limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. First, the results we described did not survive multiple comparison correction, possibly because of the relative small sample size. However, this was also supported by an a priori hypothesis of a preferential involvement of the left hemisphere language network. Second, the VBM analysis could be unable to detect very subtle changes in gray matter density due to the limited number of observations.\nMoreover, previous studies have demonstrated that presymptomatic P301L mutation carriers in MAPT gene have impaired verbal fluency and frontal executive functions, 1 and therefore a more detailed cognitive assessment will be needed in order to evaluate in depth either subtle syntactic and semantic anomalies or dysexecutive deficits in asymptomatic carriers. Only the follow-up of these subjects may add important hints into the understanding of PGRN-FTD course, the disease penetrance, and the possible involvement of more extensive brain language network at MRI in later disease stages.\nThis report represents the initial findings from which a longitudinal study will be designed to delineate the natural history of brain structural changes in FTD associated with PGRN genetic variation.\nKnowing the time and anatomic location of the initial degenerative process due to PGRN mutations is important not only for understanding the molecular substrates in FTD, but for timing the future treatment interventions that might prevent the disease, and for designing clinical trials as well. Our data indicate that loss of white matter integrity indexed by fractional anisotropy through DTI seems to be an early feature in this familial FTD.\nThe search of the genetic basis of FTD has been ongoing for more than a decade; establishing the timing of brain changes to FTD status brings new insight to the disease pathogenesis and disease course. The study of other pedigrees of asymptomatic PGRN mutation carriers is warranted.",

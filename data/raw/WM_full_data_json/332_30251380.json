    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that acute illness may play a significant and previously unrecognized role in promoting or accelerating neurodegenerative disease in older adults. 1,2 Specifically, hospitalization, 3 critical illness, 4 and acute infection 5 have each been linked to subsequent cognitive decline and incident dementia. However, the mechanism for these associations is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that events associated with hospitalization may initiate or exacerbate pathophysiological processes that underlie structural neurodegenerative changes, increasing the risk for cognitive and functional decline, and ultimately, dementia.\nIn support of this hypothesis, our group has previously published results from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study demonstrating a link between the occurrence of hospitalization over an 11-year period and both cognitive decline and increased ventricular size. 1 However, participants in this initial study were generally younger than 75 years of age, the hospitalization surveillance period was relatively brief, and measures of white matter (WM) microstructural integrity were unavailable. Since this previous report, 1 an older and significantly larger group of participants (some of whom contributed data to our prior paper) have returned for a 3T brain MRI as part of the ARIC Neurocognitive Study. This has allowed us to examine the effects of hospitalization, critical illness, and infection, occurring over a 24-year period, on the underlying brain structure of a biracial cohort of adults transitioning from midlife to older adulthood. Using a large sample of community-dwelling individuals, we tested the hypothesis that hospitalization, particularly for critical illness and major infection, is associated with smaller total and regional brain volume, greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and lower WM microstructural integrity among older adults.",

Participants were selected from four U.S. communities: Washington County, MD; Forsyth County, NC; northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Jackson, MS. 6 Participants underwent a baseline examination (Visit 1), and four additional in-person follow-up examinations (Visits 2-5; Figure 1). Structured interviews and medical examinations were conducted at each visit. ARIC Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each participating center. All participants gave written informed consent.\nA subset of participants (n1,978) who attended Visit 5 received a brain MRI following their medical examination. See Supplementary Methods for the detailed MRI selection criteria. Briefly, we excluded all participants with MRI contraindications and selected all participants who participated in the Brain MRI Ancillary Study (2004-2006). All participants with evidence of cognitive impairment at Visit 5 (2011-13) and an age-stratified random sample of participants without cognitive impairment were also included. 7 Additional study inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Figure 1.",

Trained staff reviewed and abstracted all hospitalization discharge codes. Using ICD-9 codes, we applied a methodology described previously 8 to identify the presence of critical illness during each hospitalization (yesno). Critical illness was classified as any one of the following: shock, severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, respiratory or cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and prolonged ventilation. We also classified each hospitalization as including a major infection (yesno) using ICD-9 codes for septicemia, bacterial infection, and pneumonia, as categorized by Clinical Classification Software. We also defined a second hospitalized infection variable, which included major and non-major infection, for exploratory purposes (Supplementary Methods).",

AD Signature Region was derived by calculating the combined volumes of the parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal lobules, hippocampus, and precuneus. 10 WMH volume (mm 3 ) was assessed quantitatively from FLAIR images using a computer-aided segmentation program (FLAIR-histoseg). 11 All analyses were adjusted for total intracranial volume. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of lobar WM were calculated from the DTI sequences, as has been described previously (see Supplementary Methods). 12 Lower FA and higher MD are associated with poorer WM microstructural integrity. We used standardized measures of FA and MD for total brain WM.",

WMH volume was log-transformed to correct for skewness. First, we compared participants with one or more hospitalization(s) to those with no hospitalization. Second, we examined the effect of multiple hospitalizations by dividing participants into groups based on the total number of hospitalizations (0, 1, 2-3, 4-5, 6) and comparing each group to the group with no previous hospitalizations. Among participants who had been hospitalized, we made the following comparisons: (1) critical illness vs. no critical illness, and (2) major hospitalized infection vs. no major infection. We used a hospitalized comparison group to separate the effect of critical illness and infection from that of hospitalization more generally. All analyses were adjusted for the following covariates: racecenter, education, sex, age at MRI, APOE ε4 allele status (presentabsent), baseline physiological variables (BMI, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL), smoking and alcohol use status and prevalent medical comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, CHD, heart failure, CKD, and COPD) occurring before or during the follow-up period, up to the time of MRI (Visit 5).\nRegression analyses incorporated sampling weights to account for the ARIC Visit 5 brain MRI sampling strategy. Therefore, the results presented represent estimates based on the entire ARIC Visit 5 population. We conducted several sensitivity analyses. To examine the potential for reverse causation, we repeated analyses after omitting participants with incident dementia and those who scored below the 5 th percentile on a midlife (Visit 2) measure of global cognitive status. We also repeated analyses after omitting participants with clinical stroke before Visit 5. Lastly, as an alternative method to control for confounding while mitigating bias related to differential attrition, we calculated propensity scores 19 for attrition and for each hospitalization event, used these propensity scores to match and compare participants from distinct exposure groups, and incorporated propensity scores as covariates in fully-adjusted regression models (Supplementary Methods). 20 A two-sided p-value .05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Using a community-based prospective study, we have shown that all-cause hospitalization, critical illness, and infection are each associated with evidence of MRI-defined structural brain abnormalities in a large sample of older adults. Specifically, participants with one or more hospitalization during a 24-year surveillance period spanning from middle to late-life who survived into older adulthood demonstrated greater WMH volume and reduced WM microstructural integrity as older adults. We also found evidence for a dose-dependent relationship between the number of hospitalizations and late-life MRI measures. While significant reductions in total and regional brain volume were observed only among participants with four or more hospitalizations, reductions in WM integrity were found among participants with as few as two hospitalizations. Among participants who were hospitalized, those who experienced a critical illness andor a major infection had smaller brain volumes in regions vulnerable to AD in late life. The estimated effects of critical illness and infection on these brain regions was approximately 2 and 1.5 times that of a single APOE ε4 allele, respectively. To provide context, a single APOE ε4 allele is associated with a 3-fold increase in AD risk, and an age of AD onset that is 10 years earlier than that of older adults without an APOE ε4 allele. 21 Importantly, our findings were observed after adjusting for demographic and physiological variables, medical comorbidity, and APOE genotype, and remained after demented participants were excluded.\nIn addition to replicating and extending previous findings linking all-cause hospitalization to reductions in WM integrity and brain volume, 1 the current results build upon those of previous studies, which have identified critical illness 22 and infection 2,23 as risk factors for incident dementia. WM abnormalities and brain volume loss represent markers of pathological brain changes that are more proximal to the pathophysiology underlying cognitive decline and dementia. Thus, our findings lend support to the idea that critical illness and infection promote neurodegenerative brain changes, which may, in turn, set the stage for late-life cognitive and functional decline. Loss of brain volume in Alzheimers disease relevant regions presumably reduces the threshold at which AD pathology induces overt clinical symptoms. The effects of critical illness on brain volume may be partially accounted for by stroke, as the magnitude of these associations was attenuated after excluding stroke cases. On the other hand, the association of major infection with smaller brain volume was independent of stroke and critical illness. Infection, even when broadly defined to include mild or non-life-threatening infections, was associated with brain volume loss, albeit to a lesser extent than major infection. Although participants with one or more hospitalization demonstrated greater WMH volume and DTI diffusion abnormalities compared to those who were not hospitalized, we did not find evidence for the emergence of additional WM abnormalities attributable to critical illness or infection.\nThe current study is unique in that it compared participants with critical illness and infection to a hospitalized control group, allowing us to parse out the neurologic sequelae associated with each of these exposure variables from that of hospitalization more broadly. Additionally, the current study had a relatively long follow-up period, which allowed us to capture hospitalization events and incident medical comorbidity over a two-to three-decade period beginning in midlife. This is of importance given that (1) the neurodegenerative processes that may be influenced by our hospitalization variables are suspected to begin during midlife and gradually evolve over decades, 24 and (2) the midlife disease and vascular risk factors, which increase the risk of hospitalization, have also been associated with latelife neurodegenerative changes. 25 Thus, the extended study design allowed us to adjust for midlife risk factors and incident medical comorbidity to reduce the likelihood of confounding. Our findings are further supported by a series of sensitivity analyses which used propensity score methods to address confounding while also adjusting for bias related to informative censoring. Hospitalization, critical illness, and infection may contribute to neurodegenerative brain changes by promoting inflammation in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Infection and tissue damage both result in the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators throughout the body. 26,27 Systemic inflammation has been associated with reductions in brain volume 28 and WM integrity 29 and is believed to contribute to neuronal and glial dysfunction by promoting neuroinflammation and Alzheimers pathology, 30 blood-brain barrier dysfunction, 31 and changes in cerebral metabolism. 32 Additional factors associated with hospitalization, such as delirium 4 and iatrogenic medication effects 33 , may also explain the associations observed in the present study. However, caution must be exercised in making causal inferences from the current findings, as there are alternative plausible explanations. For example, cognitive decline may place individuals at greater risk for hospitalization, infection, and critical illness 34 ; however, this is unlikely to explain the current results, as our findings did not change after excluding individuals with incident dementia or midlife cognitive impairment. Alternatively, hospitalization may be an indicator of a multi-system aging phenotype (e.g., frailty), which itself may promote structural brain abnormalities.\nThe current study has several strengths, including the use of a large community sample, a relatively long follow-up and surveillance period, a rigorous assessment of medical comorbidity, and the use of a hospitalized control group. However, there are several limitations. First, because we relied on ICD-9 codes rather than chart reviews to identify critical illness and infection, our analyses may be subject to exposure misclassification. However, ICD-9 codes have been shown to identify such variables with a high level of sensitivity. 35 Second, our analyses are limited by a lack of information about potentially relevant hospital events, such as delirium. Third, without baseline brain MRIs, it is impossible to be certain that hospitalization events predated reductions in brain volume and WM integrity. Fourth, our analysis of multiple outcome variables increases the likelihood of type-1 error. Therefore, replication will be necessary to corroborate the current findings. Last, despite our attempts to account for bias using multivariable regression and propensity score methods, our results may still be subject to bias related to differential rates of death and study dropout (i.e., informative censoring; Supplementary Table 9) and residual confounding from indication bias or unmeasured variables. In particular, an increased rate of attrition among participants with more hospitalization events, major infection, and critical illness may have biased the findings in favor of the null hypothesis. Despite these limitations, our findings provide insight into the previously described link between hospitalization, critical illness, infection, and dementia. By demonstrating an association between hospitalized events and abnormalities in brain structure, our results highlight the potential role of hospitalization, critical illness, and infection in the pathological processes underlying cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease.\nHSN268201100009C, HHSN268201100010C, HHSN268201100011C, and HHSN268201100012C).

    "abstract": "Introduction of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 1980 and its advancement in the last three decades offered the possibility to visualize and quantify changes in white matter. DTI allows the evaluation of the structural integrity in complex neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Progressive disintegration of functional and structural neural network coordination contributes to the cognitive dysfunction in AD. Therefore, detection of loss of cortico-cortical projections may support an early diagnosis at prodromal stages of disease which may prove essential for future preventive AD treatment trials. Moreover, structural integrity measured by DTI may help to distinguish between symptomatic and disease modifying effects of pharmacological interventions. This review gives a concise account on the physical basis of DTI acquisition and processing. We summarize DTI findings in normal aging and AD and regarding the effects of cognitive intervention and antidementive treatment on structural neural connectivity. Finally, we evaluate the promising future potential of DTI to become a surrogate endpoint in clinical AD trials.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "In 1965, Geschwind introduced his neuropathological concept of the biological substrate of impaired higher brain functions. He suggested that the disconnection of intracortical projections rather than lesions to specific cortical areas was the biological substrate of cognitive disturbances 1,2. In 2004, forty years after Geschwind publication, Georg Siemens published a new learning theory for the digital age and described learning to be a process of connecting specialized nodes of information sources and called it connectivism. He also stated that nurturing and maintaining connections are needed to facilitate continual learning 3. Advances in imaging technology, such as the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), also led to a new neuroscientific understanding of higher brain function and its neurobiological basis.\nOver more than thirty years, MRI has proven its ability to detect white matter changes in various brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, and mood disorders 456. With the development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in vivo visualizing of the microstructural integrity of the anatomical connections between different brain regions has become possible. DTI uses the constraints that biological structures, such as myelin sheaths and axonal membranes, impose on the diffusion of water molecules to derive information on microstructural tissue integrity and the main direction of fiber tracts. By visualizing and quantifying changes of white matter integrity and connectivity, this technique provides new surrogate parameters of neurodegeneration based on parameters of microstructural integrity. This is of high interest for the evaluation of prodromal stages of AD that are characterized by a selective involvement of intracortical projections 789. Therefore, DTI is increasingly gaining momentum as a biological candidate marker for the detection of structural disconnection in prodromal AD both for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects. Towards this end there are ongoing phase 2-3 multi-center, multi-national diagnostic validation-harmonization studies using the DTI technology, such as the newly established framework of the European DTI Address correspondence to this author at the DZNE, German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease, Gehlsheimer Str. 20, 18147 Rostock; Tel: 49-381-494-9526; Fax: 49-381-494-9472; E-mail: ingo.kilimanndzne.de Study in Dementia (EDSD) that conducted clinical and phantom studies based on ten different MRI scanners in nine European centers 101112.\nThis review introduces the imaging technique of DTI, summarizes results of DTI studies in healthy aging and AD, and presents longitudinal data of treatment effects on structural connectivity in AD that suggest that DTI is a promising candidate to become a secondary endpoint of future pharmacological trials in AD.",

    "AGING, ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND CEREBRAL WHITE MATTER": {
      "text": "More than 39.9 million people worldwide are suffering from AD and the prevalence of AD is expected to rise to threefold over the next 40 years 13. These data underscore the importance of robust diagnostic criteria and markers for evaluation of therapy. The advanced understanding of the pathomechanisms and the ability to detect pathophysiological changes in a predementia stage of the disease are the basis for the development of innovative treatments. Some of these treatments aim to stop AD progression at predementia or even pre-symptomatic stages, which requires AD diagnosis at a very early stage 14. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. These alterations were found many years before clinical symptoms emerged 15,16. In the course of AD, neuronal loss and shrinkage cause atrophy which can be detected mainly in layers III and V of cortical association areas 7. The pathological substrate of the progressive dementing process in AD is the cumulative affection of the pyramidal cells located in these layers. While brain atrophy is progressing, there is substantial reduction or even loss of intracortical projections within and between cerebral hemispheres that are sustained by these pyramidal cells. With the loss of afferent and efferent connections, AD can be described as a neocortical disconnection syndrome 17. Braak and Braak observed that the progression pattern of neuronal loss and neurofibrillary change in AD was a reverse sequence of myelination in normal development of human brain according to Flechsigs concept on myelogenesis 18 19. To underline the association to ontogenetical and phylogenetical changes in human brain, this process is called retrogenesis by some authors 20. The white matter within hippocampus, neocortical association areas and the basal forebrain cholinergic system matures late and prolonged in the course of brain development and becomes the most vulnerable to changes due to aging and AD 21,22. However, the regional difference in vulnerability of myelin break down may just reflect the differences in thickness of myelination in these vulnerable regions (the later matured in ontogenesis, the thinner the myelin sheath). With the loss of myelin with age, the late-myelinating association regions with the smallest myelin reserve are at the highest risk to lose structural integrity causing disconnection of widely distributed neuronal networks 23,24. DTI provides for the first time an in vivo estimate of the integrity of these neuronal linkages. This MRI technique uses water molecules to visualize anatomical connections. DTI reveals microstructural details of brain architecture in healthy and diseased brains and leads to a better understanding of neurodegenerative disease such as AD. Changes in white matter can be detected earlier if using DTI than conventional imaging with T1 or T2 relaxation 25.",

    "DTI": {
      "text": "Only a few years after Bloch and Purcell in 1946 had independently proven the existence of a proton magnetic moment, Hahn introduced a theory of signal interferences due to molecular movement in magnetic fields (Bloch 1946;Purcell et al 1946;Hahn 1959). After Hahn had identified diffusion to be a confounding factor for the magnetic resonance signal, it took almost four decades to use this interference for imaging in experimental and clinical studies. The basic principle of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) -the basic technique for DTI -is the measurement of movement of water molecules in media. Diffusion describes the stochastic motion of molecules in liquids (Brownian molecular movement) driven by thermal energy (Brown 1828; Einstein 1905). If the diffusion follows Gaussian probability distribution across all spatial directions, the distribution of diffusion is called isotropic.\nIn biological tissue, the free random molecular motion is limited by obstacles such as myelin sheaths, intracellular organelles and macromolecules. These constraints lead to anisotropic diffusion along a preferential spatial axis (Fig. 1). The diffusion coefficient of water in biological tissue is found to be two to ten times smaller than in pure water 26. Besides mechanical restraints, ion transportation systems through cell membranes also influence the motion of water molecules in biological tissue 27. These changes are well detectable using DWI and account for the wide clinical implementation in routine protocols e.g. for the investigation of acute ischemic stroke 28.\nIn grey matter, diffusion is almost isotropic and about 2.5 fold smaller than in pure water. In white matter, the molecular movement depends on the orientation of the fibers with high anisotropy in highly organized fiber tracts.\nA symmetric 3 x 3 matrix describes the molecular movement in the three spatial dimensions (Fig. 3). This so-called diffusion tensor (from the mathematical use of tensors to describe multidimensional vector systems) quantifies the direction and magnitude of diffusion 29,30.\nGiven that elements above and below the diagonal (Dxy  Dyx, Dxz  Dzx and Dyz  Dyz ) are symmetric, six unique elements are required to describe the tensor 31.\nDiffusion tensor can be reconstructed by applying pairs of two consecutive diffusion-sensitizing magnetic field gradient pulsesthe higher the number of gradients, the better the accuracy of the tensor estimate. The minimum number of six gradients is necessary to calculate the tensor, but today at least 30 gradient directions are recommended 32.\nThe diffusion directions are given as the three eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor (v 1, v 2 and v 3 ), their magnitude by the corresponding eigenvalues ( 1 , 2 and 3 ). Anisotropic distribution can be portrayed in an ellipsoid shape, where the diffusion is greater along the axis of the tissue structure 33,34. Diffusion data can be analyzed voxelwise and the different diffusion indices provide information on tissue microstructure and architecture 35. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) quantifies the strength of isotropic diffusivity for each of the three main axes of diffusion. The ADC is frequently employed for the early detection of ischemic brain areas. However, this method does not allow assessment of the directionality of molecular movement, which requires scaling the anisotropy 36,37. Mean diffusivity (MD) reflects the overall extent of water diffusion and is defined as the average of the three eigenvalues 38. Other commonly used indices describing the main direction of water molecules movement are the relative anisotropy (RA) and fractional anisotropy (FA). RA describes the relationship of isotropic to anisotropic elements of the diffusion tensor 36,39. FA describes the degree of anisotropy on a scale from 0 (isotropic) to 1 (anisotropic). There is some evidence that changes in regional FA are predominantly due to changes of myelination. Budde et al showed that a decrease of axonal diffusivity (measurement of diffusivity along the principal axis) in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis indicates axonal damage. A decrease of axonal diffusivity commonly results in a decrease of FA 40. An increase of RA has been shown in mice after experimental demyelinisation with cuprizone 41. Cuprizone is a neurotoxin that is used as a model for demyelination in the central nervous system 42. A radiologic approach in humans to analyze the relationship of myelination and FA has been introduced by Mädler et al 2008. They demonstrated in 22 healthy adults that there is a strong relationship between FA and myelin-water fraction (MWF) in T2 relaxation 43. The interpretation of these results is limited due to the nature of comparison of two indirect markers of structural integrity.\nCombined neuroradiological and neuropathological studies of myelination and axonal loss in humans are still challenging due to fixation problems of unmyelinated fibers and the size of these axons. With less than 1 micrometer, unmyelinated axons cannot be discerned in light microscopy and the use of electronic microscopy is needed 44.\nSince tissue microstructure is linked to the main direction of fiber tract diffusivity, maps of tissue structural orientation can be derived based on the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue. Mapping of direction and degree of diffusion in the brain is achieved by color-coded orientation (e.g. red for right-left, green for anteriorposterior and blue for superior-inferior orientation) and intensity scaling the degree of diffusion within each voxel (Fig. 2). With this mapping the microstructure of white matter can be assessed and physiological and pathological changes can be explored 454647.",

      "text": "DTI-based tractography uses the diffusion tensor to delineate the fiber connectivity along preferred directions and to generate a map of white matter connections of different anatomic areas including cerebral hemisphere, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord of the brain through the white matter 33,484950. Employing the long axis of the diffusion ellipsoid across subsequent voxels, the direction of a white matter bundle can be estimated and white matter pathways can be reconstructed 51. This deterministic tractography connects neighboring voxels starting from one or more seed voxels defining the origin of the fiber tracts under examination 525354. In contrast to deterministic tractography, probabilistic tractography quantifies the likelihood for each voxel to be included in the diffusion pathway between two voxels or regions of interest (ROI) 55,56. Using different thresholds of probability, different deterministic fiber tracts can be derived from one single seed region.\nThe use of DTI as a biomarker requires its stability across multiple sites. To date, there are only a few studies about reliability and stability of DTI derived markers. Variability of FA was reported between two to three scanners mostly in a small number of brain regions only 575859. A European study on multicenter stability of DTI measurement included 16 different MRI scanners in 12 European specialized neuroradiological centers. The study involved both a physical phantom (a fiber ring with constant anisotropy at each position embedded in a homogeneous medium) and a clinical phantom (a healthy 24-year-old woman) that were scanned at each of the 16 scanners. The scanning of the physical phantom showed interference with the automatic shimming, so that only eight out of 16 went into further analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 5.2 to 9.8 depending on the ROIs. The brain scans of the human phantom reached a mean CV of 14 for the tract based statistics and 29 for the deformation based analysis 10. These data indicate that DTI acquisition is more susceptible to multicenter effects than structural MRI, which needs to be taken into account for the application of DTI as biomarker in future multicenter clinical studies.",

    "DTI IN NORMAL BRAIN Effect of Adolescence and Aging": {
      "text": "Hasan et al showed FA difference in the uncinate fasciculus and corpus callosum across age groups in 108 healthy subjects. Across an age-range between 7 to 68 years, FA was higher in childhood and adolescence than in older adults. The FA value reached its peak at the age of 20 for the uncinate fasciculus and 30.5 for the corpus callosum. The study found no significant gender-effects for FA 60.\nConsistently the age-of-peak of white matter FA in 831 healthy children and adults whose age ranged from 11 to 90 was 39 years in the cingulum and 23 years in the sagittal striatum. FA in the cortico-spinal tracts was not correlated with age 61, consistent with the early maturation of these fiber tracts during brain development.\nA similar DTI study examined twelve major white matter connections in the brain of 403 healthy subjects between 5 and 83 years of age and reported a peak of FA increase between 20 and 42 years of age 62. Based on the assumption that FA in brain white matter predominantly reflects changes of myelination 41,43,63, these findings underscore the theory of regional dyssynchrony of postpartal myelination in the human brain introduced by Flechsig in 1901 (Flechsig 1901).\nWith older age, age-related decreases of regional FA were found in cross-sectional studies suggesting that aging-related degradation of white matter integrity occurs in several brain regions including frontal, parietal and periventricular regions as well as the corpus callosum 6465666768.",

    "Association with Cognition": {
      "text": "Several DTI studies on normal brain revealed a positive relationship between higher brain functions and white matter integrity. Schmithorst et al analyzed 47 healthy children aged 5 to 18 and found positive correlations of FA and a negative correlation of MD with the intelligence quotient (IQ) measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The main effects occurred with association fibers bilaterally in frontal, occipito-parietal and occipito-temporo-parietal areas 69.\nIn 22 (aged 9-15) healthy children, higher FA in the bilateral temporal and occipital white matter was associated with better memory in complex design memory tests. Higher scores in verbal learning tests correlated with FA in bilateral anterior temporal poles and bilateral cerebellar hemispheric regions. However, the influence of age on memory test performances was very high, making it difficult to separate between effects of age and white matter integrity 70. Fryer investigated the impact of microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum on neuropsychological testing in eighteen adolescents (age 161718 and found visuospartial construction abilities to be associated with higher FA in the splenium and body of the corpus callosum. Higher scores in language and motor functions test correlated with higher FA only in the splenium of the corpus callosum 71. Very few data have been reported on older adults without dementia. Kantarci et al showed in 220 non-demented subjects (age 52 to 95) that higher FA values in inferior longitudinal fasciculus were associated with better memory and language function. High FA values in the anterior or posterior cingulum showed influence on executive function and attention and memory function. FA changes in the fornix only had positive correlations to language testing score 72.\nXiong demonstrated in his study on 165 cognitive healthy subjects with and without a family history of AD that FA was lower in subjects with family history of AD compared to controls. These differences where significant in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum. Individuals with ApoE4 genotype -a major risk factor for AD -had lower levels of FA in the gyrus rectus and higher level than those without ApoE4 73. Bendlin et al did not find any significant effect of ApoE4 on FA or MD in his study with 136 cognitive healthy subjects with and without a family history of AD. Subjects with parental family history of AD showed significant reduction of FA in cingulum, corpus callosum, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus and hippocampus 74.",

The study did not find any specific difference between the two groups during the study period 75. In a larger group of 106 healthy adults (age 50-90) after a two-year period the decline of FA was even higher than predicted from the interpolation of cross-sectional data. In this study, ROIs were manually set by comparing tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) computation of skeletonised images with a white matter labels atlas. Investigated regions were genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule, the external capsule, the anterior and posterior cingulum and the superior corona radiata. The ROI analysis of FA differences between baseline and follow-up showed significant decrease of FA in the genu of the corpus callosum.

    "CHANGES OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY IN AD AND MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT": {
      "text": "The early studies on neuropathological changes of white matter in AD were published in the 1980 th by Brun and Englund. The postmortem brain examination of 48 AD patients (20 early onset, 28 late onset) and 26 non-demented controls (aged 49 to 100) showed partial loss of axons, myelin sheaths and oligodendroglial cells with slight reactive astrocytosis in AD patients. The spared myelin sheaths and oligodendroglial cells showed no swelling and the apparent fibrohyaline thickening of the wall of many capillaries did not stain with Congo red. There were little to no changes of white mater found in the control group 77.\nMRI studies in AD patients showed high prevalence of white matter hyperintensities; however these findings demonstrated weak association to the clinical symptoms 78,79. Neuropathological examinations and comparison with post-mortem brain MRI scans found a decrease in FA in regions with white matter lesions compared to regions with normal appearing white matter. White matter regions with hyperintensity on MRI showed more astrogliosis, which on the other hand was related to higher axonal loss and myelin degradation 80. This data suggests again the association of FA decline and axonal or myelin loss. These data agree with both a primary degeneration of intracortical connecting fiber tracts with synaptic loss and axonal degeneration and Wallerian degeneration secondary to primary loss of cortical neurons. The retrogenesis model of AD pathogenesis predicts that fiber tracts that mature late during brain development are the most vulnerable to AD. Therefore, DTI is an important imaging tool to study the involvement of different fiber tracts across different stages of AD. Consistent with the neuropathological findings DTI revealed increased MD in the hippocampal formation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia compared to healthy controls in the bilateral hippocampus 818283. Other studies on MD in subjects with MCI or AD reported no significant differences in MD in these regions 84,85. In all studies the region of interest was set manually.\nReduction of FA has been reported in other areas of the brain in AD patients beyond the hippocampus including temporal, frontal, parietal lobe regions as well as association fibres of the limbic system 83,8687888990 (Fig. 4).\nColor-coded visualization of different fiber tract directions helps to identify projecting fibers more precisely. But still, the manual placing of ROIs shows relevant inter-rater variation despite the use of color maps and co-registered anatomical scans to increase identification of anatomical regions and fiber tracts. The validity of clearly defined anatomical regions in native space is the strength of this method, but reliability of investigator-determined ROIs is limited and there is a risk of contamination with cerebral fluid spaces leading to partial volume effects. The latter limitation can partly be overcome by appropriate thresholding of diffusion intensity values. The manual delineation of ROI and the rigorous training needed to reach high rater reliability is very time consumption and limits the method for the use in small subject groups. Semi-automatic and automatic setting of ROI is able to reduce this time allowing analysis of more regions or larger subject groups reducing the statistical errors introduced in small size group analysis. Still, ROI analysis is an a-priori approach and is insensitive for changes elsewhere in the brain but in the ROI 11,919293.\nVoxel-based automated analysis searches the entire brain for group differences of diffusion values 94. They all are based on an initial step of automated spatial transformation of diffusion maps into a reference standard space, such as the MNI space. The approach for spatial normalisation greatly varies across studies. Frequently, studies drive the normalisation through an anatomical MRI scan where the low-dimensional (voxel-based morphometry -VBM-type) or high-dimensional DBM (deformation-based morphometry -DBM-type) transformation parameters are applied to the diffusion map that has been brought in spatial coregistration with the anatomical MRI scan. The advantage of this approach is its relatively simple implementation through widely available software packages (such as SPM8) and the possibility to study diffusion differences across the entire brain without the need to formulate a priori hypothesis on regional effects. Its disadvantage is that this approach does not easily account for partial volume effects, where due to the limited spatial resolution of DTI data in the presence of atrophy the diffusion signal is disproportionally more confounded by larger CSF spaces in AD brains than in control brains. Additionally, the results of this type of analysis are sensitive towards the selection of the size of the smoothing kernel that is employed to enhance the power of the voxel-wise statistics. For these reasons, tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) has found broad application in the last years. TBSS uses a predefined fiber tract skeleton for the normalisation of diffusion data into a common standard space. The highest signal intensity in a defined proximity around each voxel of the fiber tract template is used as representative for the signal intensity of this specific fiber tract voxel in a given scan. This approach yields an implicit partial volume correction and does not rely on the selection of a smoothing kernel. On the negative side, the TBSS approach tends to attenuate effects not only due to unwanted variability such as partial volume effects, but also due to relevant biological variability. It also restricts the search region to the areas of the predefined fiber tract skeleton, which, however, represents the most relevant fiber tracts of the brain.\nVBM-and DBM-type DTI studies showed significant reductions of regional FA in patients with MCI and AD in posterior brain parts. A voxel-by-voxel analysis of white matter changes in 14 AD patients, 16 subjects with amnestic MCI and 21 healthy controls demonstrated significant reduction of FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fibers underlying the superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulated bundle, superior and posterior thalamic peduncles, sub-lobar extra-nuclear white matter and fibers underlying the paracentral lobule in AD patients compared to controls. The location of FA changes in MCI subjects compared to healthy controls was largely overlapping to regions with FA reduction in AD patients 88.\nA TBSS based ROI study in 31 subjects with MCI and 22 subjects with AD compared to 23 healthy controls revealed a FA decrease in the parahippocampal whiter matter, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum and fornix as well as in brainstem and cerebellar white matter. The quantitative ROI analysis showed that the FA values of MCI subjects were in-between values of AD and healthy controls 95. TBSS analysis of intra-cortical late-myelinating fiber pathways such as inferior longitudinal fasciculus, prefrontal cortex white matter, temporo-parietal brain regions showed significantly lower FA in AD subjects compared to healthy controls. Supporting the retrogenesis hypothesis there was no change in earlymyelinating pathways like the pyramidal pathways or the sensorimotor cortex 11,96,97. In a larger TBSS study in MCI, Zhuang et al measured FA applying TBSS in 96 subjects with amnestic MCI (aMCI), 69 subjects with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) and 252 cognitively normal controls (HC). FA decline was demonstrated in both MCI groups with the best discrimination between aMCI and HC group in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the crus of fornix. The accuracy of distinction was 74,8 (sensitivity 71,0, specificity 76,2). FA decline was detected also in the naMCI group compared to HC, but there was no anatomically homogeneous pattern of changes 98.\nInitial MRI studies have begun to investigate the diagnostic use of DTI based on multicenter data, employing fiber tracking approaches or voxel-based analysis 11. The results suggest that mul-ticenter acquisition moderately affects diagnostic accuracy of DTI compared to monocenter studies in AD. Studies in prodromal AD have still to be conducted.\nProspective harmonization of the acquisition protocol achieves a reduction of center effects in DTI studies. But still, even using same manufacturer of scanners to reduce effects due to signal-tonoise factor, implemented software or receiver bandwidth center effects are found. Statistical models used in multicenter studies should consider center effects and add this as covariate factor 11,99,100.\nA longitudinal DTI study of 11 healthy controls and 14 MCI subjects demonstrated decline of FA in both groups after 13 to 16 months. The corpus callosum, cortico-petal and cortico-fugal projections and the thalamic radiation were involved in these changes. There was also a reduction of FA in the interhemispherically projecting tracts such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus. There was no significant difference between MCI subjects and healthy controls at baseline and in the degree of FA changes over time 101.",

    "EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE INTERVENTION ON WHITE MATTER": {
      "text": "Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are nonpharmacological therapy strategies to help people with early-state dementia. Cognitive training is a guided practice on a set of memory tasks whereas cognitive rehabilitation addresses individual needs and goals to take in new information or methods of compensation in a multiprofessional setting. Due to the use of different training tools or interventional design the interpretation of the different studies on cognitive intervention in AD patients or MCI subjects is very limited. Randomized, double-blinded, controlled trails on cognitive rehabilitation are still missing and there are very few on cognitive training. Specific cognitive training can improve memory and learning ability in healthy elderly but the efficacy of this intervention in AD patients concerning memory, cognitive functioning and behaviour is still discussed controversially 102103104105. Cognitive intervention leads to changes in white matter microarchitecture and can be measured by DTI. Poor readers have lower FA in the centrum semiovale than good readers and successful 100h reading training in healthy children is associated with an increase of FA in just that region 106. After 101 units of 1h trainings on episodic and working memory training as well as perceptual speed tasks in a time period of 180 days, training effects on the white matter microstructure occurred in the anterior part of the corpus callosum. The magnitude of these changes showed no difference between young and older adults 107. Even short term memory training in healthy adults leads to significant increase of FA in the left anterior hemisphere. This change correlated with memory performance at the end of the training 108. A functional MRI (fMRI) study in MCI subjects showed activation and increase of white matter network connectivity after explicit memory training. However, only six participants were assessed in this study without control group and the blood oxygenation level depending (BOLD) signal of fMRI identifies changes in functional rather than structural connectivity.\nEffects of cognitive training on structural connectivity is another interesting approach to better understand the mechanism of action of such interventions and to assess their efficacy, but the number of studies is still small and the results are not conclusive.",

    "EFFECTS OF ANTIDEMENTIVE MEDICATION ON FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY": {
      "text": "Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are a well established medication used in mild to moderate AD. Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine have shown their efficacy to reduce the speed of cognitive functions decline in AD 109. There is very few imaging data available on the effects of ChEIs on brain tissue in general and even less on effects on white matter. A structural MRI study showed that typical reduction of hippocampal volume in subjects suffering from AD was diminished in subjects receiving ChEIs compared to controls 110. One limitation of this study is the use of a pre-existing data set of controls instead of randomisation. Brain white matter volume of patients with minimal-to-mild AD treated with rivastigmine did not show any significant change of brain volume measured by voxel-based morphometry over a period of twenty weeks. In contrast, AD patients treated with donepezil and galantamine did suffer from brain volume reduction over the study period. The difference between groups might reflect delayed or slowed reduction of white matter connectivity 111. The interpretation and generalization of these findings, however, is severely restricted due to the retrospective analysis and the selected population of AD patients with BuChE wild-type allele. fMRI demonstrated decreased compensatory cortical activation in the dorsal visual pathway during object recognition in mild AD patients treated with ChEIs compared to placebo 112. Resting-state fMRI detected an increase of the hippocampal network connectivity in mild AD patients treated with donepezil compared to baseline before treatment. These changes correlated with improvement in the cognitive subscale scores of the AD Assessment Scale 113. Enhancing regional activation was also demonstrated by higher regional cerebral blood flow in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 114. Compared to controls, there was preserved to increased cortical glucose metabolism detected in AD patients treated with ChEIs in positron emission tomography (PET) 115,116.\nA retrospective cohort study in subjects with AD found no effects of white matter lesions in computer tomography (CT) or MRI on the clinical response to treatment with ChEIs 117. The described white matter lesions in this study are presumably due to cerebrovascular disease and might be different to disease specific white matter damage in AD. Regardless of neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular origin of white matter lesions, evaluation of possible impact of ChEI treatment on white matter damage in AD was only seen in post hoc analysis.\nOne recent longitudinal study reported changes of FA in AD treated with galantamine over 12 months and was the first investigation of the effects of ChEI treatment on microstructure changes in neurodegenerative disease. 28 subjects with AD and 11 healthy controls had been enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Six month of randomly assigned treatment with galantamine or placebo were followed by another six-month open-label extension period. DTI was performed at baseline, 6month and 12-month follow-up. Healthy controls underwent DTI at baseline and 12-month follow-up. FA was determined in bilateral vertical part of posterior cingulate, midline corpus callosum. Corpus callosum was divided to 4 subregions including genu, anterior body, posterior body and splenium. FA in cerebellar vermis and lateral ventricle were determined as controlled regions. At baseline AD and HC group did not have significant differences in corpus callosum area, but FA was significantly decreased in splenium and genu of the corpus callosum in the AD group. At 6-month followup a significant FA decline was observed in the left posterior cingulate in both AD and control groups. In AD subgroups showed significant interaction between time and treatment in the posterior part of corpus callosum between AD treated with galantamine and AD received placebo. The treated AD patients showed an increase of FA while the placebo group showed a decrease of FA in this region. The 12-month follow-up revealed again a FA decline in the left posterior cingulate but a rise of FA in the cerebellar vermis over time across AD and HC group. No significant interaction between time and treatment was found on FA values in any region between the two AD subgroups. In summary, FA in the posterior body of the corpus callosum declined more slowly in the galantamine treatment group compared to placebo over a 6-month period. However, the effect did not persist after a 6-month open-label follow-up treatment of galantamine in all studied AD subjects 118. The unexpected increase of FA in the cerebellar vermis might represent the accentuated loss of crossing cerebellar fibers in neurodegenerative disease 119. The same finding of FA changes in cerebellar vermis in a longitudinal DTI study in Huntingtons disease subjects supports this theory 120. New data from stereological investigation of cerebellum in AD subjects did not find significant difference to controls in Purkinje or granule cell -the main source of crossing fibers in cerebellum -in number or density. The only difference between both groups was the cerebellar volume, which was found to be 12,7  reduced in the AD compared to HC 121. Thus, actual biological mechanisms of increase of FA in cerebellum over time in AD stay uncertain.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Fiber connections in the white matter, the basis of complex neural brain networks underlying central motor, sensory and cognitive functions, are permanently changing during the course of life. Intracortical projections were particularly identified that play an important role in higher brain function in humans, but still, most investigations concentrate rather on symptomatic classification than on the biological substrate. One reason is the lack of surrogate parameters to identify severity of structural white matter changes in the course of AD. The early structural affection of the hippocampal fiber tracts and its morphological formation in AD renders hippocampus volumetry a candidate for becoming a surrogate parameter in clinical studies 122. Fiber tract analysis via DTI might have higher multicenter effects than volumetry but still, the advantage of early detection of changes in structural integrity renders this method very promising 10. Changes in fiber tract integrity seem to occur independently from hippocampal volume alterations, underscoring the independent impact of white matter changes in the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD 101.\nDTI represents an approach to visualize and quantify white matter fiber integrity and connectivity (Fig. 5). Besides, the well known patho-anatomical hallmarks of AD such as plaques and tangles deposition, neuronal and axonal loss are the biological sub-strate for the progression of AD. In vivo, measurement of intracortical fiber tracts with DTI offers an estimate of this major biological substrate of higher cognitive functions. DTI measurement in pharmacological studies may allow distinguishing pure symptomatic effects of therapy from disease modifying intervention. Treatment effects can be analyzed based on changes in the functional connectivity representing a symptomatic treatment or based on changes in white matter integrity. Following Geschwinds and Siemens argumentum a contrario, the reduction of cortico-cortical association fibers leads to impaired higher brain functions and reduced learning ability. However, most of the studies focused on changes in clinical symptoms rather than brain structure. Siemens connectivism hypothesis demonstrates the importance of structural integrity for cognitive functions. DTI might lead to a better understanding and evaluation of the hypothesis of retrogenesis and connectivism. There should be more emphasis on studies using DTI to detect changes in white matter microstructure. But still, the biological substrates of DTI measurement are not understood in all detail and further investigation of the basic principle of this method is needed. The small number of longitudinal DTI data in AD patients and healthy subjects gives an idea on how white matter microstructure changes over the time.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "DTI measures water diffusion and represents an indirect marker of structural connectivity which may be more sensitive to decline in neurodegenerative disease than pure structural parameters 123. It may well present a valuable surrogate parameter of white matter microstructural changes in AD. In contrast to measurement of functional connectivity such as in fMRI, DTI studies can be used to quantify structural connectivity. With evolving studies -especially longitudinal multicenter studies -DTI may turn from a supportive to an important candidate biomarker, in particular in a surrogate parameter for structural integrity and microstructural changes of white matter in clinical diagnostics and therapy trials of complex brain disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.",

    "abstract": "Background-Quantitative fiber tracking derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to determine whether white matter association, projection, or commissural tracts are affected in nondemented individuals with HIV infection and to identify the regional distribution of sparing and impairment of fiber systems. Methods-DTI measured fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, quantified separately for longitudinal (λ L ) diffusivity (index of axonal injury) and transverse (λ T ) diffusivity (index of myelin injury), in 11 association and projection white matter tracts and six commissural tracts in 29 men and 13 women with HIV infection and 88 healthy, age-matched controls (42 men and 46 women). Results-The total group of HIV-infected individuals had higher diffusivity (principally longitudinal) than controls in the posterior sectors of the corpus callosum, internal and external capsules, and superior cingulate bundles. High longitudinal diffusivity, indicative of axonal compromise, was especially prominent in posterior callosal sectors, fornix, and superior cingulate bundle in HIV with AIDS. Unmedicated patients had notably high transverse diffusivity, indicative of myelin compromise, in the occipital forceps, inferior cingulate bundle, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Pontocerebellar projection fibers were resistant to HIV effects as were commissural fibers coursing through premotor and sensorimotor callosal sectors. Conclusion-This quantitative survey of brain fiber tract integrity indicates that even nondemented HIV patients can have neuroradiological evidence for damage to association and commissural tracts. These abnormalities were vulnerable to exacerbation with AIDS and possibly mitigated by HAART.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The HIV virus infects the brain through complex pathways affecting white matter before causing neuronal injury 1. Postmortem evidence for the neurotoxic process of HIV infection includes diffuse white matter degradation 2. In-vivo imaging has documented larger areas of white matter hyperintensities 3 and smaller volumes of cortical white matter 3,4 and corpus callosum in HIV-infected than in unaffected groups 5,6. HAART has increased life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals, altering the pattern of brain pathology found in pre-HAART on autopsy 7 and reducing the incidence of HIV-related dementia 8. In-vivo brain imaging shows improved or stable qualitative white matter disease indices in HIV patients with encephalopathy on protease inhibitor compared with those not so medicated 9.\nMagnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been useful in identifying microstructural compromise of white matter in HIV infection even in regions appearing normal on conventional imaging 10. Quantitative fiber tracking, however, has been used in only one other HIV study, which limited analysis to the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and found neither anisotropy nor diffusivity differences in HIV-infected individuals relative to controls 11. The present analysis expanded that fiber tracking study to quantify the integrity of 11 projection and association fiber bundles and the full extent of the corpus callosum to test the hypothesis that nondemented HIV-positive patients exhibit lower anisotropy and higher longitudinal and transverse diffusivity than controls for tracts coursing through frontostriatal regions known to show signs of HIV-related disturbance with magnetic resonance spectroscopy 12,13. Medication status and history of AIDS were also considered.",

Analyses of structural MRI 5 data and DTI genu and splenium data 11 from these HIV patients and controls and their clinical and demographic characteristics 14 have been published. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\nMen and women infected with HIV were recruited from San Francisco Bay Area outpatient HIVAIDS clinics by project staff to participate as a comparison group in a longitudinal study of the effects of alcohol on the progression of HIV infection on the brain. Controls were recruited by referral from patient participants, Internet posting, and flyers. Referrals and inquiries were followed up with a brief screening interview designed to identify exclusionary features.

      "text": "All controls and HIV patients underwent a panel of blood tests. HIV patients with a CD4 cell count below 200 cellsµl at intake were excluded from the study, which was designed to be longitudinal. Structured interviews characterized history of HIV illness, treatment, and symptoms. Medication status was characterized as HAART e.g., two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a protease inhibitor, or two NRTIs and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), non-HAART, or none. Patients entering the study had been on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) 15 confirmed the absence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence, or current (last 3 months) substance dependence or abuse in patients, and confirmed that prospective controls did not meet DSM-IV criteria for any Axis I disorder. No patient was clinically demented, but 11 (including one unmedicated person) had had an AIDS-defining event. A quantitative history of alcohol consumption yielded lifetime totals and enabled exclusion of heavy drinkers. Clinical assessment (Table 1) also included the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) from the SCID; Karnofsky score, a global rating of clinical disability; Beck Depression Index 16, a quantitative measure of depressive symptoms; socioeconomic status scale (SES), a two-factor scale based on education and occupation 17, and body mass index (height in cmweight in kg 2 ), an index of nutritional status. General cognitive status was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) 18.",

Eddy current-induced image distortions in the diffusion-weighted images for each direction were minimized by alignment with an average made of all 12 diffusion-weighted images using a two-dimensional six-parameter affine correction on a slice-by-slice basis 21. The DTI data were then aligned using the FSE data by a nonlinear three-dimensional warp (third-order polynomial), which provided in-plane and through-plane alignment. On a voxel-by-voxel basis, fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient, the latter decomposed into its longitudinal and (λ L  λ 1 ) and transverse (λ T  λ 2  λ 3 2) components, were computed. Fractional anisotropy ranged from 0 to 1 and diffusivity was expressed in units of 10 -3 mm 2  s.",

      "text": "A more detailed description of our fiber tracking procedures appears elsewhere 22. The fiber tracking routine 25,26 applies a target-source convention that restricts fibers to those originating in source voxels and passing through target voxels. Fiber tracking bundle targets were identified on the population fractional anisotropy template in several white matter locations 22: fornix, internal capsule, external capsule, frontal forceps, occipital forceps, superior cingulate, inferior cingulate, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, pontocerebellar tract, and cerebellar hemispheres. For the corpus callosum, six geometrically defined targets, modified to reflect documented 27 callosal anatomical projections 28 were identified on the midsagittal population fractional anisotropy template. Sources were perpendicular planes -anterior and posterior or superior and inferior to the targets -to the orientation of the fibers, or cubes surrounding the targets in the cases of the fornix, pontocerebellar tracts, and cerebellar hemispheres. For each patient the targets and sources were mapped from the population fractional anisotropy template to that patients native image space and passed to the fiber tracking routine 29. Tracking parameters specified minimum fractional anisotropy (0.17), 37 maximum angular deviation between voxels, and minimum (11.25 mm) and maximum (45 mm) fiber lengths, with essentially no limit on the number of fibers (other than the number of source pixels). We refer hereafter to the group of fibers coursing through each target region as fiber bundles. For each fiber bundle, mean fractional anisotropy, λ L , and λ T were the units of analysis. After fiber detection, the fiber locations were transformed back to common coordinates (i.e., population fractional anisotropy template space) for display.",

We predicted that HIV patients would have lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity values than normal controls, prominent in fiber tracts involving frontostriatal systems. Medication effects were assessed with three-group Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analyses (33 medicated HIV, nine unmedicated HIV, 88 controls) followed by Mann-Whitney tests because of the wide range of group sizes. Associations between DTI metrics and demographic, HIV indicators, motor performance, or comorbidities were tested with Pearson correlations, Spearman correlations, or χ 2 . Follow-up two-group differences with t-tests were considered significant if P was less than or equal to 0.02; three-group differences were significant with Scheffe tests (P0.05).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This report used quantitative fiber tracking to assess the microstructural integrity of major commissural, projection, and association fiber bundles in a naturalistic sample of nondemented HIV-infected men and women. Patients were not participating in treatment protocols and were heterogeneous with regard to HIV severity, treatment regimen, and comorbid conditions. Across all fiber bundles sampled, internal and external capsules (that course through the striatum), superior and inferior cingulate bundles (that link frontal to subcortical structures), and the posterior sectors of the corpus callosum showed effects of HIV, principally in longitudinal diffusivity, indicative of axonal compromise. Pontocerebellar projection fibers were particularly resistant to HIV effects as were commissural fibers coursing through premotor and sensorimotor callosal sectors.\nAlthough most patients were on HAART (n  26) or other HIV treatment regimen (n  7), only eight were completely virally suppressed at scan. The unmedicated patients were comparable in CD4 cell count to medicated patients but were more recently infected and had higher current viral loads. Patients who were either drug-naive or not currently on a treatment regimen showed markedly higher transverse diffusivity than controls in inferior cingulate bundle, occipital forceps, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, indicative of myelin degradation.\nBy contrast, patients on an HIV treatment regimen had DTI values in the control range for these bundles. The mechanistic and functional significance of this finding is unclear, but it is tempting to speculate that active but subclinical inflammation, promoted by untreated HIV infection 30, contributed to high diffusivity. Case studies describe regression of white matter signal abnormalities in HIV patients with AIDS dementia after commencement of treatment with protease inhibitors or NNRTIs 9,31.\nIn general, HIV-related fiber tract abnormalities were detected with diffusivity measures rather than fractional anisotropy, regardless of medication or AIDS status. High longitudinal diffusivity in the parietal, temporal, and occipital callosal sectors, fornix, and superior cingulate bundle was prominent in the HIV group with AIDS, although AIDS did not fully account for the observed abnormalities. The observation by Chang et al. 32 that genu diffusivity was especially useful in longitudinally tracking HIV-related white matter degeneration is consistent with our observation that high diffusivity, notably λ L rather than fractional anisotropy, serves as a marker of HIV-related neuropathology, possibly indicating an inflammatory process involving the axon.\nMost previous DTI studies of HIV-infected patients have examined specific, geometrically defined regions of interest: corpus callosum 32333435, subcortical white matter, 32,33 basal ganglia 36, and frontal white matter 32,35,37,38. Results are varied, depending on the region examined, measurement techniques, and clinical status of the patients. Our quantitative fiber tracking study identifying local disruption of microstructure in frontostriatal association and posterior commissural fiber systems, possibly selective to axons in patients with HIV infection compared with controls, extends earlier DTI studies. The limitations of the study are inherent in its naturalistic design, patient heterogeneity, and absence of formal treatment regimen. Thus, our inference for effects of HAART is based on the regional markers of myelin degradation seen in untreated but not in treated patients with comparable CD4 cell counts. The unmedicated group, however, was younger, had less education, lower socioeconomic status, and lower general intelligence scores than their medicated counterparts, factors that might have had unknown effects. To the extent that the untreated sample is representative of the untreated HIV-infected population, however, our observation raises the possibility that additional or tailored educational efforts need to be directed toward the unmedicated population. Further, the HIV-infected patients with self-professed signs of peripheral neuropathy exhibited abnormally high callosal longitudinal diffusivity, consistent with peripheral axonal damage associated with such signs 39. If left untreated, further disruption of fiber systems could contribute to worsening of sensory signs and development of cognitive and motor dysfunction. recruitment, clinical evaluation, medical examination, scheduling, screening, contact maintenance, data collection, and data entry.

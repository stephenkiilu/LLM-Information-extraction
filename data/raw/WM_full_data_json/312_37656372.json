The present coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies aimed to identify the most prominent and robust WM abnormalities in patients with MCI. A systematic search of relevant studies was conducted through January 2022 to identify TBSS studies comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) between MCI patients and healthy controls (HC).

Meta-regression analysis was subsequently applied to explore the potential associations between clinical variables and FA changes. MCI patients demonstrated significantly decreased FA in widely distributed areas in the corpus callosum (CC), including the genu, body, and splenium of the CC, as well as one cluster in the left striatum. FA in the body of the CC and in three clusters in the splenium of the CC was negatively associated with the mean age. Additionally, FA in the genu of the CC and in three clusters in the splenium of the CC had negative correlations with the MMSE scores. Disrupted integrities of the CC and left striatum might play vital roles in the process of cognitive decline. These findings enhanced our understanding of the neural mechanism underlying WM neurodegeneration in MCI and provided perspectives for the early detection and intervention of dementia.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been generally recognized as a prodromal condition of Alzheimers disease (AD), and it is mainly characterized by subjective cognitive decline and objective memory deficits while maintaining normal activities of daily living (Petersen, 2004). The annual rate of conversion from MCI to dementia andor AD could be as high as 8.1-25 (Davis et al., 2018;Petersen et al., 2018;Mitchell  Shiri-Feshki, 2009;Zhang et al., 2021a, b). Early detection and prevention of individuals at the prodromal stage of dementia is of great importance, but it is challenging to identify MCI among elderly people as the cognitive deficits observed in MCI are relatively subtle while cognitive decline is quite common during normal aging (Gu  Zhang, 2019;Luo et al., 2018;Bessi et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2020). Therefore, seeking reliable and visual biomarkers in MCI is urgently needed.",

    "White matter alterations in mild cognitive impairment revealed by meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging using tract-based spatial statistics": {
      "text": "Progress in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has made it possible to explore microstructural brain impairments and regional functional abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases. Among them, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive tool that is able to estimate the microstructure and integrity of white matter (WM) in healthy and diseased brains by measuring the diffusion of water molecules through nerve fiber bundles (Le Bihan et al., 2001). Specifically, DTI metrics seem to be a more sensitive marker of cognitive decline due to aging, even when there is no sign of gray matter (GM) volume changes and brain structure atrophy (Schiavone et al., 2009;Zhuang et al., 2012). The integrity of WM is most frequently assessed with fractional anisotropy (FA), which mirrors fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination (Talwar et al., 2021). Any reduction in WM anisotropy reflects an alteration in the degree of tissue order or integrity (Beaulieu, 2002). For the means used to analyze diffusion parameters, whole-brain analyses such as voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tractbased spatial statistics (TBSS) provide better comparability across studies than region-of-interest (ROI) analyses because they overcome the bias of region-placement preference and the absence of meaningful voxels outside of the selected regions (Chen et al., 2016). The TBSS technique has the advantages in improving sensitivity and objectivity compared with voxel-based approaches due to its carefully tuned nonlinear registration and projection of individual FA onto a mean FA skeleton, which enables direct comparisons between participants (Smith et al., 2006). Additionally, a recent study has suggested that TBSS is more sensitive than VBA in detecting WM abnormalities (Wise et al., 2016). Thus, there have been more TBSS studies conducted on MCI than VBA studies in the last decade. Disruptions in some major WM tracts have been detected in MCI, such as the corpus callosum (CC) (Haller et al., 2010), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Gupta et al., 2020), corticospinal tract (Gupta et al., 2020), frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Haller et al., 2010;Zhuang et al., 2010;Liu et al., 2013), and even thalamic radiation (Liu et al., 2013;Duffy et al., 2014).\nNumerous neuroimaging studies have been implemented to investigate the pathological mechanism of MCI. However, current findings are inconsistent regardless of brain structure or function research (Raine  Rao, 2022).\nTo overcome the heterogeneities between these different studies, coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) served as a powerful approach to synthesize neuroimaging findings from different studies in a comprehensive way, which helps to overcome the discrepancies of regional alterations among various brain imaging studies (Liu et al., 2022). This method can also distinguish false results from replicable findings, and summarize and integrate a large amount of data across studies (Muller et al., 2018). Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) serves as one of the most commonly used CBMA and has been applied in investigations of neurodegeneration in MCI. Two recent ALE meta-analyses (Yu et al., 2017;Gu  Zhang, 2019) obtained a complete picture of WM microstructural alterations in MCI, which gave us some hints about neuropathological changes in this disease. The involved brain regions generally play roles in cognitive and emotional regulatory processes. These studies provide hints for a better understanding of the neuropathological mechanism of MCI. Nevertheless, the abovementioned two studies included both VBA and TBSS studies, leading to methodological heterogeneity. A previous meta-analysis (Qin et al., 2021) included both MCI and AD patients, but mixed the two conditions together and analyzed them as a pooled group. Considering the shortcomings of previous meta-analyses, it is necessary to perform a CBMA based solely on TBSS studies. Here, we intended to apply the seedbased d mapping (SDM) software, which enables the results from individual studies to be weighted and controlled for multiple moderators including demographics, clinical information, and imaging factors. More importantly, unlike ALE, SDM considers null results in a meta-analysis as well, and it has been successfully applied in a range of neuropsychiatric studies using TBSS (Chen et al., 2016;Hellewell et al., 2020;Wei et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020;Suchting et al., 2021;Hu et al., 2020a, b). The first objective of this present study is to perform an updated meta-analysis of TBSS studies to define the most prominent and robust WM microarchitecture alterations in patients with MCI. Second, we aimed to investigate the potential relationships between clinical parameters (mean age, education years, symptom severity) and reported WM changes by using meta-regression approach. FA and other DTI indicators such as the mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AXD) and radial diffusivity (RD) would provide more perspectives for elucidating the neural mechanism underlying WM neurodegeneration in MCI. Among them, FA is the most commonly used parameter, which describes the degree of anisotropy in each voxel and is related to the presence and coherence of oriented bundles. Therefore, we specifically investigated FA alterations in MCI. Based on the existing findings from previously published articles, we hypothesized that MCI patients would exhibit microstructural WM abnormalities in core regions related to advanced cognitive function such as the CC and cingulum.",

The analysis was performed following the standardized SDM tutorial and previous meta-analytic studies. In brief, the SDM technique uses effect sizes combined with reported peak coordinates that are extracted from databases with statistical parametric maps, and recreates maps of the original maps of the effect size of FA between patients and controls (Radua et al., 2012). Particularly, a TBSS template based on the FMRIB58 FA skeleton (heep:www.fmrib. ox.ac.ukfsl) was adopted to restrict the analysis to the same WM tracts that were available in the TBSS studies. The major analyses were complemented by robustness analyses (Chen et al., 2016).\nThe SDM procedures have been described in detail in previous studies (Zhou et al., 2021a, b;R. Hu et al., 2020a, b;Zhang et al., 2023;Niu et al., 2021) and are briefly summarized as follows: (1) the peak coordinates of all whitematter from each dataset were extracted at the level of t-statistics (Z-or P-values for significant clusters which were then converted to t-statistics using the SDM online converter); (2) the peak coordinates for each study were recreated using a standard MNI map of the effect size of the group differences in FA by means of an anisotropic Gaussian kernel (Radua et al., 2014), which would overcome methodological heterogeneity including the image resolution; and (3) the algorithm performed random-effects analysis to obtain the mean map, combining the data of each included study and representing both negative and positive differences in the same map. The default SDM thresholds (isotropic FWHM  20 mm, anisotropy  1.0, P  0.005, peak height threshold  1, cluster extent  10 voxels) were applied in this present research in accordance with a previous meta-analysis of TBSS studies (Chen et al., 2016;Jiang et al., 2017;Hellewell et al., 2020;Hu et al., 2020a, b;Wei et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020). For each significant cluster from the patient-control comparison, the I 2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity in each significant peak (Rucker et 1 3 stable over a period of time, and converting MCI which converts to AD.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CBMA of TBSS studies to explore the most consistent and robust WM alterations in patients with MCI compared to HC. By applying the SDM approach, the present study revealed significant WM integrity abnormalities in widely distributed areas but mainly lying within the CC. In addition, one cluster of the left striatum was also identified to exhibit a decrease in FA. The jackknife sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses indicated that these findings were highly replicable. Several perceptual, cognitive, motor, and affective information (S. Zhang et al., 2020). Altered FA in distributed areas in the genu, body, and splenium of the CC was identified in our current study, which was in line with a large number of neuroimaging findings in dementia (Talwar et al., 2021;Amlien  Fjell, 2014). The genu of the CC connects the lateral and medial surfaces of the frontal lobes (Saito et al., 2008), regions playing important cognitive functions such as learning, memory and decision-making (Kievit et al., 2014;Wikenheiser  Schoenbaum, 2016). The body of the CC connects wide neocortical homotopic regions of the cerebral hemispheres, including the premotor, supplementary motor, somatesthetic, and posterior parietal regions (Saito et al., 2008). Microstructural WM abnormalities in this nerve fiber bundle might lead to reduced quantity and speed of information transfer between these brain areas (S. Zhang et al., 2020). There are also strong projections from the splenium of the CC that sweep inferiorly along the lateral margin of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle reflects disrupted WM integrity in the brain, and impaired WM integrity is associated with cognitive dysfunction in aging and early AD (Power et al., 2019). Brain atrophy is considered to be the neurobiological basis of cognitive decline (Callisaya et al., 2019;Biessels et al., 2014;Ryan et al., 2014). Disruptions of WM and atrophy of GM often cooccur. Decreased GM volume (Zhang et al., 2021a, b) and reduced cortical thickness (Raine  Rao, 2022) have been previously reported in MCI. Compared with VBA, TBSS was specifically developed to restrict analysis within the center of the major WM tracts (Smith et al., 2006;Bach et al., 2014), and thus usually acquired less distributed integrity changes. Our findings could provide a more comprehensive perspective on the neurodegeneration of MCI.\nDeteriorations of the CC are one of the most frequently reported DTI findings in MCI, as revealed by both TBSS studies and VBA studies (Yu et al., 2017). The CC is the largest interhemispheric WM commissure connecting the cerebral hemispheres, playing crucial roles in communicating (Damoiseaux et al., 2009) 8 (5) 22 ( 13) 73.9 70.7 NA NA 25.9 28.7 1.5 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 0 (Haller et al., 2010) 67 ( 38) 35 ( 26) 65.0 63.7 NA NA 28.1 28.9 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 22 (Teipel et al., 2010) 14 ( 6) 11 ( 4 77.6 77.9 10.9 11.9 28.3 28.7 3.0 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 44 (Agosta et al., 2011) 15 ( 7) 15 ( 9) 70.4 69.8 9.0 12.3 25.8 28.8 1.5 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Douaud et al., 2011) 56 ( 25) 61 ( 22) 70.1 71.1 NA NA 27.9 29.9 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 0 (O Dwyer et al., 2011) 14 ( 7) 40 ( 24) 68.0 66.0 13.0 13.0 27.9 29.3 3.0 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Bosch et al., 2012) 16 ( 10) 15 (10) 74.6 75.3 NA NA 25.5 27.7 3.0 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Wang et al., 2012) 40 ( 16) 30 ( 11) 77.3 76.1 11.4 13.5 NA NA 1.5 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Liu et al., 2013) 40 ( 23) 28 ( 17) 65.7 63.5 10.3 10.5 NA NA 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 5 (Duffy et al., 2014) 30 ( 11) 22 ( 14 Bharath et al., 2017) 48 ( 13) 48 ( 13) 67.2 65.9 12.9 13.0 28.0 30.9 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 0 (Gerstenecker et al., 2017) 31 (23) 60 (44) 71.9 70.6 15.2 16.0 26.9 29.1 3.0 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Woodward et al., 2017) 15 ( 6) 25 ( 19) 73.5 67.4 NA NA 26.3 28.6 3.0 T P  0.05, FWE corrected 0 (Ding et al., 2018) 55 ( 30) 26 ( 13) 65.0 66.0 16.0 16.0 29.0 29.0 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 0 (Zhang et al., 2019) 29 ( 13) 34 ( 11) 74.1 69.0 12.8 12.9 25.6 29.1 3.0 T P  0.05, TFCE corrected 0 (Fu et al., 2020) 14 ( 8) 14 ( 7 understanding of the role of striatum and cingulum WM in MCI. Additionally, previous evidence has proposed that increased MD would be suggestive of myelin breakdown, while an increase in AXD or RD is more associated with axonal damage (Alves et al., 2015). Altered MD, AXD, and RD were also widely observed within the aforementioned brain regions in MCI and AD (Talwar et al., 2021;Alves et al., 2015). Taken together, disrupted integrities of the CC, the left striatum and the right cingulum might interfere with the neural information transmission between neighboring brain areas, which led to the decline of multiple cognitive domains in MCI patients.\nMeta-regression analysis revealed that FA in the body and splenium of the CC was negatively correlated with the mean age of patients. A recent large-sample study mapped brain charts across the human lifespan, demonstrating that WM volume experienced an accelerated decline after 50 years from birth, and situations were more deteriorated in MCI and AD patients (Bethlehem et al., 2022). Moreover, previous longitudinal TBSS studies found a significant progression of WM fiber tract damage in the CC in MCI and AD subjects (Teipel et al., 2010;Weiler et al., 2015). Our results further confirmed the above findings. FA in the genu of the CC and in three clusters in the splenium of the CC also had a negative correlation with the MMSE scores in MCI patients. Therefore, our findings suggested that disrupted microstructures in these regions might be related to cognitive decline. This might provide visual and quantifiable indicators for the early prediction of dementia in future clinical practice.\nIt is worth noting that several studies included in our metaanalysis detected no significant FA differences between MCI patients and cognitively normal elderly people. The symptoms of MCI patients are generally mild, and the changes in brain structure are relatively subtle. Some prior TBSS studies identified widespread regions of reduced FA in widespread regions compared with healthy older adults but observed nonsignificant differences in DTI metrics between HC and MCI individuals (Wai et al., 2014;Gerstenecker et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2019). Other studies have demonstrated similar WM regions with reduced anisotropy in MCI patients but to a much greater extent in AD patients (Carter et al., 2014;Shu et al., 2011). Considering that MCI is the early stage of dementia and has a high risk of developing into AD, this highlighted the significance of early detection and intervention of MCI. In addition, it should be noted that our findings were hardly overlapped with previous metaanalyses (Yu et al., 2017;Gu  Zhang, 2019). The inconsistency might be caused by the following two aspects: On the one hand, their meta-analyses included both VBA and TBSS findings, while the current study focused solely on TBSS studies. Our former CBMA on obsessive-compulsive disorder found that inconsistent results existed between VBA and project into the temporal lobes (Wakana et al., 2004). Atrophy in the temporal lobes is one of the earliest neuroanatomical changes in preclinical Alzheimers disease and is especially associated with poor performance on distinct cognitive domains including composite scores of memory and executive functioning (Smits et al., 2014;Mortamais et al., 2017). In addition, the left striatum also exhibited a decrease in FA in our meta-analysis. The striatal circuits are essential for reward learning and decision-making (Cox  Witten, 2019). Abnormal GM volume and intrinsic brain activity of the striatum could account for cognitive impairments (Valdes Hernandez et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2016). Using a more lenient statistical threshold of P  0.01, FA reductions in the right cingulum were also detected. Damage to the cingulum was considered to contribute to cognitive decline pathophysiology (Bozzali et al., 2012;Alves et al., 2015). Our DTI meta-analysis results enhanced our and TBSS studies due to the methodological heterogeneity (Z. Zhang et al., 2021a, b). On the other hand, the work by (Gu  Zhang, 2019) and (Yu et al., 2017) were conducted by using the ALE approach. The SDM algorithm considers null results in a meta-analysis as well (Radua et al., 2012), rather than just assessing the probability or likelihood of a peak as ALE does. A recent meta-analysis of DTI studies in neurodevelopmental disorders demonstrated distinct findings using these two different methods (Zhao et al., 2022a, b), which confirmed our speculations.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be declared. First, the heterogeneity of data acquisition parameters and clinical variables in the included studies could not be eliminated by statistical means. Second, most studies have not distinguished between aMCI and naMCI but pooled them together as a whole patient group. Therefore, a subgroup meta-analysis was not performed, and we could not estimate whether these MCI subjects were specifically AD related. Third, similar to other CBMA approaches, the SDM is based on the coordinates from published studies rather than on raw data, which limits its accuracy. Unfortunately, some previous TBSS researches detected FA differences between MCI and HC, but lacked reported coordinates. These studies were not included in our meta-analysis. Fourth, other diffusion indices (MD, AXD, and RD) are meaningful in illustrating microstructural WM changes in MCI. However, we were unable to perform the meta-analyses with these DTI indices given that there were not sufficient datasets (minimum of 10 datasets recommended for SDM meta-analyses). Last but not least, the current meta-analysis and the literature included in our research are all cross-sectional designs, and we were not able to predict whether the MCI subjects would convert to AD. Longitudinal studies with respect to the progress of cognitive decline and the degeneration of brain microstructures are more valuable, and should be explored in the future.",

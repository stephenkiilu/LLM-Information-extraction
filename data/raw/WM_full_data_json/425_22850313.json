    "abstract": "The structural integrity of the cerebral white matter, including that of the white matter lesions (WML) and of the surrounding normal appearing white matter (NAWM), can be assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which is suggested to be of added value in the explanation of cognitive dysfunction in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). We investigated the value of DTI of NAWM and WML in addition to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in the variance of cognitive performance in subjects with SVD. 499 individuals with SVD, 50-85 years, without dementia, underwent MRI scanning, including a DTI sequence. Grey matter, white matter (WM), and WML volume, number of microbleeds, lacunar and territorial infracts, and mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in NAWM, WML, and total WM were related to cognitive performance in multivariate regression analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, and education. All MRI parameters together accounted for 1-6 of the variance in cognitive function on top of 22-36 already explained by age, gender, and level of education. Both mean MD and FA of the NAWM, WML, and total WM did not substantially contribute to the explained variance of cognitive function, to that already explained by conventional MRI parameters. When considered separately, the MD of the (NA)WM had the strongest association with cognitive performance. In conclusion, DTI of NAWM and WML has limited additional value to conventional MRI parameters in the etiological explanation of the variance in cognitive function among individuals with SVD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), including white matter lesions (WML), lacunar infarcts, and microbleeds. Both hospital-and population-based studies have shown that severe cerebral SVD is an important cause of cognitive impairment and may ultimately contribute to the development of dementia, including Alzheimers disease 123. Despite the high prevalence of SVD in the population over 60 years of age, only few individuals with SVD ultimately develop dementia 456.\nApparently, factors other than SVD as seen on conventional MRI play a role in this transition to cognitive disturbances that, in some, will eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. With respect to SVD, conventional MRI differentiates normal appearing white matter (NAWM) from WML and lacunar infarcts. Within WML, the extent of white matter (WM) tract disruption substantially varies 7. The integrity of NAWM surrounding the SVD related lesions may be another potential factor contributing differential cognitive decline. SVD on conventional MRI usually affects only a few percent of the total WM 8, leaving the remainder of the WM appearing normal.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has proven beneficial in assessing the microstructural integrity of both the WML and the NAWM 9,10. DTI provides quantitative information about the structural integrity of the WM 11,12. This technique is based on the principle of molecular diffusion of water and provides, amongst others, two parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). FA reflects the directionality of diffusion, whereas MD reflects the degree of diffusivity. FA decreases and MD increases are typical indications of impaired structural integrity 13. However, the relative importance of each of these MRI and DTI parameters in explaining the variance of cognitive performance in patients with SVD, and with that the value of DTI in clinical practice, is not clear. It is unknown which (combination of) conventional MRI parameter(s) explains most of the variance in cognitive function and to what extent the microstructural integrity of the WML and NAWM contributes to cognitive disturbances, on top of the abnormalities already seen on conventional MRI.\nWe therefore investigated which (combination of) conventional MRI parameter(s) accounted for the largest portion of variance explained in cognitive function. Furthermore, we determined the additional variance in cognitive function explained by the microstructural integrity of the WML and the NAWM to that explained by SVD, and other brain lesions, including territorial infracts and grey matter (GM) and WM volume, visible on conventional MRI.",

      "text": "The Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion tensor and Magnetic resonance imaging Cohort (RUN DMC) study prospectively investigates the risk factors and clinical consequences of brain changes among 503, 50-85 years old non-demented elderly individuals with cerebral SVD. The selection procedure of the participants and the study rationale and protocol were described in detail previously 14.\nIn short, on the basis of established research criteria, SVD was defined as the presence of lacunar infarcts andor WML on neuroimaging 15. Accordingly, in 2006, consecutive patients referred to the Department of Neurology between October 2002 and November 2006, were selected for participation and investigated from 2006 to 2007. MRI scanning was performed in this same time window. Inclusion criteria were: (a) age between 50 and 85 years; (b) cerebral SVD on neuroimaging (WML andor lacunar infarcts). The main exclusion criteria were dementia 16, (psychiatric) disease interfering with cognitive testing or follow-up, WML or SVD mimics, and MRI contraindications or known claustrophobia.\nFrom 1,004 invited individuals by letter, 727 were eligible after contact by phone of which 525 agreed to participate. In 22 individuals, exclusion criteria were found during their visit to our research center, yielding a response of 71.3 (503705). All participants signed informed consent. The local Medical Review Ethics Committee approved the study. For the present study four subjects were excluded because of MRI artifacts, yielding a sample of 499 subjects.",

GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) probability maps were obtained by automated segmentation using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 unified segmentation routines on the T1-weighted MPRAGE images (SPM5; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London, UK) 17. Total GM, WM, and CSF volumes were calculated by summing all voxel volumes that had a p  0.5 for belonging to the tissue class. Total brain volume was taken as the sum of total GM and WM. Intracranial volume (ICV) was a summation of all tissue classes, i.e., total GM, total WM, and CSF volume. To normalize for head size, total brain volume was expressed as percentage of total ICV. Mutual information coregistration (SPM5) was used to align WML maps to the T1 image and to yield a NAWM map (the complement of WML in WM) 14.",

In short, we calculated compound scores for seven cognitive domains: 1) Global cognitive function was evaluated by the a) Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and b) the Cognitive Index. The Cognitive Index is a compound score that was calculated as the mean of the z-scores of the 1-letter subtask of the Paper-Pencil Memory Scanning Task, the mean of the reading subtask of the Stroop test, the mean of the Symbol-Digit Substitution Task, and the mean of the added score on the three learning trials of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the delayed recall of this last test 1. 2) Verbal memory was assessed as the compound score of the mean of two z-scores from the RAVLT; one for the added scores of the three learning trials of this test, and one for the delayed recall of this test. 3) Visuospatial memory was assessed as a compound score of the mean of the z-scores of the immediate recall trial and the delayed recall trial of the Rey Complex Figure Test. 4) Psychomotor speed was calculated as the mean of the z-scores of the 1-letter subtask of the Paper-Pencil Memory Scanning Task, the reading subtask of the Stroop test, and the Symbol-Digit Substitution Task 1. 5) Fluency was calculated from the mean of the z-scores of both verbal fluency tasks. 6) Concept shifting was calculated as the z-score of the third subtask of the Stroop. 7) Attention was assessed as a compound score of the z-score of the total time of the verbal series attention test 1.",

WML volume distribution was normalized by log-transformation.\nFirst, we used Pearsons correlations to assess the associations between age and MRI parameters. Second, to establish which MRI parameters (conventional MRI or DTI parameter) explained most of the variance in different cognitive domains, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis (with age, gender, and education included in every model), for each MRI parameter separately. Territorial infarcts and brain atrophy were taken into account, because these abnormalities often co-exist with SVD-related MRI abnormalities 8 and are related to cognition as well. Third, we assessed which combination of conventional MRI parameters (only those conventional MRI parameters that showed significant correlations when analyzed separately, as described above in the second step) and DTI parameters (MD and FA of both WML and NAWM) accounted for the largest variance in cognitive performance. For each cognitive domain, a multiple regression analysis was performed with the introduction of age, gender, and education prior to the MRI parameters. The MRI parameters were subsequently added in an automated (forward) stepwise fashion to optimize the model fit. Finally, we assessed the increase of variance explained in cognitive performance by DTI on top of conventional MRI parameters in order to assess the added value of DTI over conventional MRI. We did so by using a multiple linear regression model in which age, gender, and level of education were introduced first, followed by all conventional MRI parameters (those that showed significant correlations when analyzed separately in step two), and subsequently the DTI parameters (MD of NAWM or WML or total WM).",

    "RESULTS": {
      "text": "Demographics and neuroimaging characteristics of the 499 subjects are shown in Table 1. Mean age was 65.6 years (SD 8.8) and 56.5 were male. Mean WM volume was 464.4 ml (SD 66.5), the largest part of the WM consisted of NAWM, with a median percentage of 98.5 (IQR 96.0-99.2).\nTable 2 represents the Pearsons correlations between the different MRI and DTI parameters. Almost all MRI parameters were significantly correlated to each other, apart from some correlations with territorial infarcts and microbleeds. The correlations with the mean FA and MD in the NAWM were almost similar for both the NAWM and total WM. Mean FA and MD of the WML, NAWM, and total WM strongly correlated with WML volume (correlation coefficients for FA between -0.42 and -0.54, p  0.001; for MD between 0.62 and 0.66, p  0.001) and age.\nSecond, we determined the additional amount of variance in cognitive performance explained by each MRI parameter separately on top of age, gender, and education (Table 3). Most of the MRI parameters were significantly associated with all cognitive domains, except for FA and MD in the WML, WM volume, and territorial infarcts. Mean MD in the NAWM and in the total WM explained most variance of the MMSE, cognitive index, verbal memory performance, and attention. In addition to age, gender, and education, it explained another 1.5-2.4 of the performance in the different cognitive domains, resulting in explained variance between 23 and 38 for the different cognitive domains. WM volume explained most of the variance in psychomotor speed, followed by the mean MD in the NAWM and total WM. In all cognitive domains, DTI parameters accounted for only slightly more variance in cognitive performance than the conventional SVD parameters (WML volume, number of lacunar infarcts and number of microbleeds).\nThird, we determined which combination of MRI parameters explained most variance in cognitive performance, on top of age, gender, and level of education, which already accounted for 21.7-35.7 (Table 4). The mean MD of the NAWM explained most of the variance of the MMSE (1.4), cognitive index (1.9), verbal memory performance (1.4), attention (2.4), and visuospatial memory (0.7; data not shown). WM volume was the most important determinant of psychomotor speed (2.6) and concept shifting (2.2; data not shown). GM volume explained most of the variance in fluency (1; data not shown). The total explained variance of all MRI parameters (both conventional and DTI) together, on top of age, gender, and education ranged from 1-6. Finally, Table 5 shows the results of the added value of the mean MD of the NAWM, WML, and total WM over conventional MRI parameters in terms of explained variance of cognitive function. Conventional MRI parameters accounted for 1.0 to 4.2 on top of age, gender, and level of education in the variance of all cognitive domains. A significant increase in variance, on top of conventional MRI measures, was explained by MD in the NAWM and total WM for the cognitive index, verbal memory performance, psychomotor speed and attention, but no more than 1.0. This was not found for MMSE, visuospatial memory performance, fluency, and concept shifting (data not shown for latter three). The MD in the WML did not explain an increase in variance in any of the cognitive domains.\nWe performed the same analyses for FA in the NAWM, WML, and total WM and all cognitive domains and found a similar amount of variance in cognitive domains explained by the mean FA.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this large cohort of individuals with cerebral SVD, all MRI parameters together explained 1-6 variance in performance on different cognitive domains, in addition to the 22-36 variance already explained by age, gender, and level of education. Both the mean MD and FA of the NAWM, WML, and total WM did not substantially contribute to the variance explained of cognitive function, to that already explained by conventional MRI parameters. Conversely, when each MRI parameter (conventional and DTI) was investigated separately, the MD of the (NA)WM had the strongest association with most cognitive domains.\nStrengths of our study included the large sample size, the single center design, with a high response rate, the extensive assessment of cognitive function, and all participants examined by only two investigators. In addition, we performed all MRI scans (conventional and DTI sequences) on a single scanner, and with quantitative assessment of WML, GM, and WM volume. Age, gender, and education were introduced in the model prior to MRI parameters (model 1). MRI parameters (those significant in Table 3 and MD in the WML and NAWM and mean FA in WML and NAWM) were then added in a stepwise fashion. Total explained variance and standardized beta-value describe the values till that step as variables are progressively added to the model. NAWM: normal appearing white matter, WML: white matter lesions MD: mean diffusivity, FA: fractional anisotropy,  log transformed.\nOther strengths are the manual segmentation of the WML without prior knowledge of the clinical data and the assessment of microbleeds as another manifestation of SVD. A limitation is the cross-sectional analysis of this part of the study, which prevents us from drawing conclusions about the predictive value of MRI parameters in cognitive decline and AD. However, the RUN DMC study has a longitudinal design and follow-up is currently being executed 14. Second, cognitive function is also influenced by several factors that intentionally were not taken into account in this study such as medial temporal lobe atrophy, as we wanted to investigate the effect of SVD on cognitive function. Finally, we investigated a rather healthy study population with a relatively intact cognitive function (mean MMSE 28.1; SD 1.6) and most of them had mild to moderate white matter damage on conventional MRI. Consequently the integrity of the NAWM in most participants will probably be relatively intact, limiting the statistical power to detect an additional effect of DTI parameters in the NAWM to that of conventional MRI parameters.\nThere might be several reasons why only a small part of the variance in cognitive function was accounted for by conventional MRI parameters for SVD (4) and by the microstructural integrity of the (NA)WM (an additional 1). Non-differential misclassification in both determinant and outcome could have played a role in the little contribution found. In addition, other imaging parameters, such as medial temporal lobe atrophy, and the presence of depressive symptoms might be other important factors in the variance of cognitive function in individuals with SVD, as both have been related to SVD and cognitive performance as well 21,22. In addition, selective survival may have played a role in the relative minor contribution of MRI parameters to cognitive performance due to a decreased susceptibility of the effect of SVD on the cerebral WM among survivors. Moreover there is probably a selective nonparticipation of survivors with a higher degree of SVD and more cognitive disturbances. Another explanation for the relative small contribution of SVD in the variance of cognitive performance may be due to so called competing risks. Competing risks occur in an aging population where multiple risk factors for one single disease are present, thereby limiting each individual (relative) contribution to the disease. Our findings furthermore showed that GM and WM volume play an important role in the explained variance of psychomotor speed, fluency, and concept shifting. These findings are consistent with previous studies in SVD patients that have shown a relation between cognitive function and markers of cerebral atrophy 23, such as atrophy of the corpus callosum 24, GM volume, and hippocampal volume 25.\nOther cross-sectional studies investigated the value of DTI compared to conventional MRI in relation to cognitive function and found inconsistent results. While some small studies among individuals with WML showed that DTI parameters correlated stronger with cognition than conventional MRI parameters 26,27, a diffusion weighted imaging study on 147 CADASIL patients found brain atrophy to have a stronger independent influence on cognitive function than the mean apparent diffusion coefficient of the whole WM 28. However, it is difficult to compare our results with the results from these studies because of different study populations, the much larger sample size of our study, different methods in lesion quantification and different outcome measures. In addition we took more conventional MRI markers into account, including brain atrophy, territorial infarcts, lacunar infarcts, and microbleeds, which may have led to the lower additional value of DTI parameters compared to other studies. DTI parameters of the total WM and NAWM are highly correlated and explained the same variance in cognitive performance. This is probably due to the fact that the NAWM constitutes the largest part of the WM (median percentage of 98.5). Damage to the structural integrity of the NAWM accounted for very little variance in cognitive performance in addition to the SVD related lesions visible on conventional MRI. This might be due to the high correlation between WML volume and the mean FA and MD of the NAWM which we found (Table 2), which suggests that WML volume is a marker for the microstructural integrity of the NAWM. This is in line with findings in other studies 29.\nOur results show that DTI does not seem to have additive clinical value in understanding cognitive impairment in patients with SVD. However, despite the small contribution of DTI parameters in the variance of cognitive performance at the cross-sectional level, DTI parameters may be of additional value in longitudinal studies and clinical trials in which there is interest in a surrogate marker for progression of cognitive disturbances, eventually resulting in dementia in some and in the evaluation of potential therapeutic effects of disease modifying drugs. This is of great interest as the rate of cognitive decline is slow, neuropsychology is time consuming, expensive and of limited value in repeated testing due to learning effects; these limitations require very large samples andor long duration studies 30. A few longitudinal studies showed that DTI is sensitive to change over a short period of time and correlated with change in cognitive test scores, while this is not the case for conventional MRI markers 26,31,32. However, more longitudinal studies are needed to replicate these results with serial DTI analysis to establish the predictive value of DTI parameters in cognitive decline additional to conventional MRI parameters.\nIn conclusion, DTI of the WM (NAWM, WML or total WM) does not seem to be of added value to the conventional MRI parameters, in the etiological explanation of the variance of cognitive impairment in subjects with SVD. Future longitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate the sensitivity of both conventional MRI and DTI markers to changes in lesion load over time and their association with cognitive performance and AD and to determine whether DTI measures of the (NA)WM or (a combination of) conventional MRI markers, such as WML volume, and atrophy could be a surrogate in therapeutic trials in SVD.",

    "abstract": "Objective White matter (WM) projections were assessed from Alzheimer disease (AD) gray matter regions associated with β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, or neurodegeneration to ascertain relationship between WM structural integrity with Aβ andor tau deposition. Methods Participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), PET Aβ ( 18 FAV-45 florbetapir), and PET tau ( 18 FAV-1451 flortaucipir) imaging. Probabilistic WM summary and individual tracts were created from either a composite or individual gray matter seed regions derived from Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration. Linear regressions were performed for Aβ, age, tau and WM hyperintensities (WMH) to predict mean diffusivity (MD) or fractional anisotropy (FA) from the corresponding WM summaries or tracts. Results Our cohort was composed of 59 cognitively normal participants and 10 cognitively impaired individuals. Aβ was not associated with DTI metrics in WM summary or individual tracts. Age and WMH strongly predicted MD and FA in several WM regions, with tau a significant predictor of MD only in the anterior temporal WM. Conclusion Tau, not Aβ, was associated with changes in anterior temporal WM integrity. WMH, a proxy for vascular damage, was strongly associated with axonal damage, but tau independently contributed to the model, suggesting an additional degenerative mechanism within tracts projecting from regions vulnerable to AD pathology. WM decline was associated with early tau accumulation, and further decline may reflect tau propagation in more advanced stages of AD.",

      "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology involves the propagation and accumulation of 2 proteinaceous deposits, β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. The posited temporal etiology occurs decades before clinical presentation and involves accumulation of Aβ, followed by increased tau pathology and then neurodegeneration. 1 The pattern of neurodegeneration is spatially distinct and correlates more with tau compared to Aβ. Although a relationship has been observed between tau and atrophy, little is known as to whether tau decreases white matter (WM) integrity. 2 WM damage seen with AD has been attributed largely to vascular changes, but AD pathology exacerbates axonal damage. 3 Loss of WM integrity can result from hyperphosphorylation of tau. This hyperphosphorylation leads to a loss of binding to microtubules, causing reduced structural integrity within the axon. 4 Prior studies have used amyloid PET, 5 tau PET, 6 and neurodegeneration (structural MRI) 2 to define distinct compilations of gray matter regions that delineate AD stage. Each biomarker contributes to the pathophysiology of AD, and a set of distinct regions can be used to define a particular measure (Aβ, tau, or neurodegeneration). It remains unclear how the presence of Aβ or tau can affect WM projections from AD-signature regions that are spatially distinct from vascular damage. This study focuses on whether Aβ or tau accumulation contributes to degeneration of WM projections from AD-signature regions determined by Aβ, tau, or neurodegeneration.",

      "text": "Bilateral AD-signature seed regions were evaluated based on a priori topographic knowledge of amyloid PET, 5 PET, 6 and neurodegenerative atrophy 2 that differentiated symptomatic AD (CDR score 0) from cognitive normal participants (CDR score 0). Summary PET values were calculated for regions designated as Aβ (A-summary), tau (T-summary), or neurodegeneration (N-summary). WM projections emanating from the interface voxels of each ROI were created by FMRIB Software Librarys (FSLs) probabilistic pipeline on the same 9 Human Connectome Project participant described in the previous section. 13 Diffusion data was already preprocessed by the WU-Minn Consortium. 14 This pipeline consisted of correction for EPI distortions, eddy-currentinduced distortions, participant motion, and gradient nonlinearities with TOPUP and EDDY from FSL. 15,16 BedpostX from FSL was used to quantify diffusion parameters on the preprocessed data. 13 This tool uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to calculate the dominant and secondary fiber distributions for each voxel. Each gray matter ROI, in native space, was treated as a seed region for probabilistic tractography. 13 A single exclusion mask was used in the sagittal plane for the EH projections in the T-regions anterior to the body of the hippocampus. The exclusion of these fibers was necessary to diminish the degree of overlap with projections from the amygdala due to their close proximity. On completion, the threshold of each probabilistic mask was 10 of the maximal intensity to reduce sporadic projections. While no optimal threshold has yet been established, this relatively low threshold has previously been deemed appropriate. 16 All individual probabilistic masks were warped into the Montreal Neurological Institute space with a combination of linear and nonlinear alignments. All probabilistic masks pertaining to a particular track were combined across participant and then limited to voxels present in a majority of participants. One methodologic complication with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is that WM voxels may contain information for multiple tracks. To ensure that no voxel was overrepresented, a data-driven algorithm was incorporated. 17 In short, this approach assigns overlapping voxels by comparing track occupancy adjusted for the relative size of both tracts. Implementing this technique forgoes any arbitrary assignment but can yield slightly different projections, depending on the degree of overlap between each of the subset ROIs. After all voxels have been uniquely assigned to 1 track, any voxel that is not contiguous with the main cluster is removed. These tracks served as ROIs with a summary of all WM tracts that project from the A-summary, T-summary, and N-summary regions or individual tracts from each seed region (figure 1).",

Each diffusion metric was smoothed with a 2-mm smoothing kernel and registered to the FMRIB58 FA with a combination of linear and nonlinear alignments.\nUnlike gray matter segmentation, WM tracts can travel through the same regions; therefore, voxels can contain information for multiple tracts. To ensure that overlapped voxels were not overrepresented in the analyses, a data-driven approach was used to assign them to specific tracts. 17 Because of this methodologic complication, the same seed region can generate different WM tracts, depending on the degree and spatial overlap between Aβ, tau, and neurodegenerative regions.",

Segmented maps were registered to each participants b0 image with FLIRT from FSL with a 6-parameter model. The maps are then aligned with the same warp matrix created from the FA images to register the lesion maps into common space with nearest-neighbor interpolation. This allowed us to isolate the lesion voxels that overlapped with our WM tract masks, providing a more localized value of WMH burden. Each voxel that was delineated as lesion, within the tract of interest, was summed to give a total value that was incorporated into the corresponding regression model. We believed this approach was more suitable for our analyses because we were focused on specific WM projections that were created for this study.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We focused on 4 variables that relate to WM integrity and AD pathology. No interaction was observed between any of the variables, but rather, independent main effects of age, WMH, and tau best predicted WM integrity in temporal regions. These results suggest that tau, independently from vascular changes (as assessed by WMH) and Aβ, is a predictor of WM integrity within anterior temporal regions. The main predictors of WM integrity were age and WMH, which are known factors that are associated with myelin breakdown and axonal degeneration. However, the presence of phosphorylated tau is a hallmark of AD, and prior neuroimaging findings showed that tau first accumulates in anterior temporal regions, bolstering the spatial relationship we observed with DTI metrics. 19 We focused on 4 variables that relate to WM integrity and AD pathology. Tau contributed to the model independently of WMH, suggesting that AD pathology can exacerbate axonal damage in addition to vascular changes.\nAssociations between WM integrity and Aβ have not been consistently found across the literature. 9 In unadjusted analyses, Aβ may serve as a proxy measure for other pathologies (e.g., tau), which are intrinsically associated with it. Aβ pathology was associated with WM integrity when tau and WMH were not included in the regression model (data not shown). However, after tau PET was included in the model, Aβ PET was not associated with any DTI metric. These results suggest that tau is more strongly associated with concurrent neurodegeneration compared to Aβ. The hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to a loss of binding to microtubules, causing loss of structural integrity within the axon. 4 In our data, MD correlated most with tau, implying that this DTI metric is sensitive to early, tau-mediated neurodegeneration.\nAD pathology is not uniformly distributed throughout the brain but instead consists of distinct spatial patterns defined by Aβ accumulation, tau accumulation, and structural atrophy. 1 Because of these different spatial profiles, seed regions defined by each biomarker have been previously used to characterize AD progression. We show that tau accumulation in anterior temporal regions associates with loss of WM integrity. Age and regional WMH most strongly predicted diffuse WM integrity changes, suggesting that global measurements of structural dysfunction are affected most by non-AD pathology. However, temporal regions are vulnerable to early tau accumulation that is independent of both amyloid and vascular damage. Future studies that include larger populations of individuals with symptomatic AD who are followed up longitudinally are needed. DTI metrics may provide an important biomarker for predicting and monitoring tau progression in symptomatic AD.",

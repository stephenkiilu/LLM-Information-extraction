    "abstract": "Background: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) causes white matter damage and cognitive impairment, in which astrogliosis is the major pathology. However, underlying cellular mechanisms are not well defined. Activation of Na  H  exchanger-1 (NHE1) in reactive astrocytes causes astrocytic hypertrophy and swelling. In this study, we examined the role of NHE1 protein in astrogliosis, white matter demyelination, and cognitive function in a murine CCH model with bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). Methods: Sham, BCAS, or BCAS mice receiving vehicle or a selective NHE1 inhibitor HOE642 were monitored for changes of the regional cerebral blood flow and behavioral performance for 28 days. Ex vivo MRI-DTI was subsequently conducted to detect brain injury and demyelination. Astrogliosis and demyelination were further examined by immunofluorescence staining. Astrocytic transcriptional profiles were analyzed with bulk RNAsequencing and RT-qPCR. Results: Chronic cerebral blood flow reduction and spatial working memory deficits were detected in the BCAS mice, along with significantly reduced mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the corpus callosum, external capsule, and hippocampus in MRI DTI analysis. Compared with the sham control mice, the BCAS mice displayed demyelination and axonal damage and increased GFAP  astrocytes and Iba1  microglia. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein with its inhibitor HOE642 prevented the BCAS-induced gliosis, damage of white matter tracts and hippocampus, and significantly improved cognitive performance. Transcriptome and immunostaining analysis further revealed that NHE1 inhibition specifically attenuated pro-inflammatory pathways and NADPH oxidase activation. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that NHE1 protein is involved in astrogliosis with pro-inflammatory transformation induced by CCH, and its blockade has potentials for reducing astrogliosis, demyelination, and cognitive impairment.",

    "Background": {
      "text": "Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) have been identified as an important vascular pathologic process in the initiation and progression of vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease (AD), which together account for approximately 60-80 of dementia worldwide 1,2. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) resulting from either large or small cerebral vessel diseases (such as carotid atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) causes subsequent white matter lesions (WMLs) and cognitive impairment and dementia 345. Carotid stenosis-induced cerebral hypoperfusion is an independent risk factor for WMLs and cognitive impairment 567, with severe stenosis causing pronounced cognitive impairment 6,7. Characteristic pathology of VCID includes white matter lesion, cerebral atrophy, gliosis, and endothelial damage, in part resulting from oxidative stress and neuroinflammation 3,8. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms for hypoperfusion-induced WMLs and VCID are not well understood, and there is an urgent need to better understand its pathogenesis and develop therapies for the prevention andor treatment of VCID.\nReactive glial cells, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress are closely correlated with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment 9,10. Glial activation was detected in the early stage of AD patients, and the subsequent glia-mediated inflammatory process was suggested to lead to cognitive impairment progression 11,12. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory biomarkers in older adults were significantly associated with cerebral small vessel disease and cognitive decline 13,14. Experimental data from a chronic hypoperfusion-induced murine VCID model showed that gliosis and a sustained inflammatory response play an important role in white matter lesion development 15. Activation of astrocytic Na  H  exchanger 1 (NHE1) causes hypertrophy and swelling of reactive astrocytes after acute brain injury 16,17. In reactive astrocytes or activated microglia, NHE1 protein plays an important role in regulating intracellular pH (pH i ) homeostasis by extrusion of H  in exchange for Na  18192021. NHE1-mediated H  extrusion promotes sustained NADPH oxidase (NOX) function and pro-inflammatory responses by maintaining an alkaline pH i in microglia 19. Moreover, increases in intracellular Na  in reactive astrocytes following NHE1 protein activation trigger a reversal of Na  Ca 2 exchange and stimulation of the Ca 2 -dependent signal pathways, including the release of glutamate and cytokines from astrocytes 20,22. In a mouse neonatal hypoxia-ischemia brain injury model, pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 by its potent inhibitor HOE642 reduced corpus callosum white matter damage and improved cognitive function 23. These studies demonstrated that activation of glial NHE1 protein is involved in gliosis and neuroinflammation after acute ischemic or hypoxia neonatal brain injury. However, whether NHE1 protein activation plays a role in astrogliosis in chronic hypoperfusion-induced brain injury remains unknown. In this study, using a well-established murine bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model for CCH, we detected increased GFAP  astrocytes and Iba1  microglia exhibiting NHE1 protein expression. Post-BCAS administration of the selective NHE1 inhibitor HOE642 significantly decreased astrogliosis, preserved white matter and hippocampus integrity, and improved cognitive function by preventing astrocytic ROS production and inflammatory transcriptomes. These findings revealed the potential of pharmacological blockade of NHE1 protein in reducing cerebral hypoperfusion-induced chronic brain injury and cognitive impairment.",

PeriCam laser speckle contrast analysis shows that sham mice displayed no significant changes in rCBF from prior to surgery through 30 days post-surgery (p  0.05, Fig. 1b,c). In contrast, the BCASVeh mice and BCASHOE (i.p.) mice displayed 45 rCBF reduction at the onset of BCAS, which gradually recovered to 75 of baseline by 30 days post-surgery (p  0.05, Fig. 1b,c).

Representative directionally encoded color (DEC) maps, FA maps, and T2-weighted images showed no obvious white matter lesions in the four groups (supplemental Fig S1a). However, DTI metrics measurement and analysis of white matter tracts (Fig. 2a), such as corpus callosum (CC) and external capsule (EC), revealed an average of 15 reduction in the mean FA values in CC (p  0.05, Fig. 2b) and 11.2 reduction in EC (p  0.05, Fig. 2b) in the BCASVeh brains, compared to sham brains. In contrast, the BCASHOE-treated brains (i.p. or pump) showed significantly higher FA values in CC and EC than the BCASVeh brains (p  0.05, Fig. 2b). These non-biased DTI findings indicate that pharmacological blockade of NHE1 protein preserved white matter integrity, which may contribute to improved neurological function outcomes. This speculation is supported by immunofluorescence staining of these brains for assessment of demyelination, shown by loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) and axonal neurofilament (NF-200) expressions. Due to a lack of optimal anti-MBP and NF200 antibodies for double labeling, the images in Fig. 2c were obtained from anti-MBP or anti-NF200 staining with DAPI respectively. Compared to sham or naïve brains (supplemental Fig. S2), reduction of MBP (40-48) and NF expression (44-47) was detected in CC and EC of the BCASVeh brains (p  0.05, Fig. 2c,d) or the BCAS mice (supplemental Fig. S2).

However, the 3D structures of reactive astrocytes in the BCASHOE brains exhibited astrocytic morphology similar to sham brains, with smaller soma volume and process diameter or less process terminal points. Similar patterns of morphologic changes of astrocytes in EC among these three groups were also detected (data not shown).

Ex-vivo T2-weighted MRI showed slight injury to the hippocampus of the BCASVeh and BCAS HOE (pump) mice (double arrow, Fig. 5a). In contrast, DTI metrics measurement revealed that the whole hippocampus (from bregma -0.94 to -4.04 mm in both hemispheres) of the BCASVeh mice exhibited significantly lower FA values but higher RD values, and a trend of higher MD values, compared to sham brains (p  0.05, Fig. 5b,c). The reduced FA along with increased MD and RD have been broadly reported to be associated with demyelination 34. In further analysis of different hippocampal regions, the BCASVeh brains displayed higher MD and RD values in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (slm) and molecular layer (ml) of the dentate gyrus (p  0.05, Fig. 5b-d). Interestingly, the BCAS HOE (pump) mice exhibited values of DTI metrics (either in the whole hippocampus or its strata) that are comparable with sham mice (p  0.05, Fig. 5b-d). But, the BCASHOE (i.p.) group showed similar DTI metrics (FA, RD and MD values) with the BCASVeh mice. In assessing hippocampal gliosis in these brains with immunostaining of GFAP  reactive astrocytes, we detected substantial reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampus of the BCASVeh brains (arrow, Fig. 6a), with a significant increase in GFAP intensity in the stratum radiatum (sr) of the hippocampus and an increase in GFAP  astrocytes, albeit insignificant, in polymorphic layer (pl) of the dentate gyrus (arrow, Fig. 6b,c).

We found that the alternation rate of mice in Y maze test was correlated with FA value change in CC (r  0.473, p  0.05) and EC (r  0.64, p  0.05) (Fig. 7a,b and supplemental Table S1). At the cellular level, elevation of reactive GFAP  astrocytes in CC (r  -0.733) or EC (r  -0.609) and activated Iba1  microglia in CC (r  -0.622) or EC (r  -0.653) were negatively correlated with spatial working memory of mice in Y maze test (Fig. 7c,d and supplemental Table S1). In the hippocampus, GFAP  astrocyte counts and Iba1  counts in the sr or pl of the hippocampus significantly correlated with the alternation rate in Y maze test (Fig. 7e, f and supplemental Table S1). The alternation rate in Y maze task was also significantly correlated with RD in slm and ml of hippocampus (r  0.55-0.6, supplemental Table S1), although we did not detect a correlation between cognitive function and DTI metrics of the whole hippocampus. Taken together, these findings suggest that glial activation in white matter tracts and hippocampus is closely associated with spatial working memory impairment induced by BCAS. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein attenuates glial activation, which led to the preservation of white matter integrity and hippocampal integrity and improvement of spatial working memory.",

    "Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein revealed reduced transcriptome profiles of ROS production and inflammatory responses in astrocytes": {
      "text": "To understand the underlying mechanisms of NHE1 protein in astrogliosis in BCAS brains, we conducted an RNA-seq of MACS-isolated brain astrocytes from sham, BCASVeh (i.p.), and BCASHOE (i.p.) mice (Fig. 8a). The purity of the isolated ASCA2  astrocytes was validated by their highly expressed gene markers Atp1b2, Slc2a1, Aqp4, Gfap, Aldh1l1 that are specifically enriched in astrocytes (Supplemental Fig. S6). Specifically, no marker genes for neurons and only trace levels of specific marker genes for microglia, oligodendrocytes, or endothelial cells were detected. The bulk RNA-seq analysis identified 1130 differentially expressed genes in the BCASHOE-treated brain astrocytes, compared with the BCASVeh-treated brain astrocytes (Fig. 8b), including 340 upregulated genes and 790 downregulated genes (Fig. 8c). GO analysis using DAVID software showed that the upregulated genes were involved in neuroprotective biological processes, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, multicellular organism development, nervous system development, myelination, and ion transport (p  0.05) (Supplemental Fig. S7), whereas the downregulated genes in the BCAS HOE-treated brain astrocytes were mainly involved in biological processes of cell cycle and inflammatory responses (Supplemental Fig. S8).\nIn light of diverse transcriptomic profiling of reactive astrocytes in different disease models 36,37, we further explored the changes of reactive astrocyte transcriptomes in our study. In comparison to the sham controls, the BCASVeh astrocytes showed significant upregulation of classic transcriptomic signatures of reactive astrocytes, including pan-reactive signatures (Vim, Lcn2, Cd44, Steap4, Cxcl10, Gfap, Serpina3n, Osmr, Timp1), the reported clustered A1 phenotype genes (Fkbp5, Gbp2, H2-D1, H2-T23, Iigp1, C3, C4b, Psmb8, Serping1, Srgn) or A2 phenotype genes (Cd14, Emp1, Ptgs2, Tgm1) (p  0.05 and FC  1.5, Supplemental Fig. S9). In contrast, the astrocytes isolated from the BCASHOEtreated mice presented transcriptome profiles that resembled the sham control astrocyte profile, e.g., with downregulated pan-reactive signatures (Vim, Lcn2, Cd44, Cxcl10, Hspb1, Gfap, Serpina3n, Osmr, Timp1), and lower expression level of the clustered genes (Gbp2, H2-D1, C3, C4b, Psmb8, Serping1, Srgn) and (Cd14, Emp1, Ptgs2, Tgm1) (supplemental Fig. S9). Collectively, these results demonstrated that BCAS triggered proinflammatory transcriptome changes of reactive astrocytes, and pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 prevented such changes in astrocytes.\nIn addition, the pathway enrichment analysis using IPA for DEGs reveals that BCAS induced activation of the inflammation and cell cycle-related pathways, compared with sham groups, and that HOE642 treatment inhibited these changes (p  0.05 and Z-score  3, Fig. 8d). Of note, the production of NO and ROS in macrophages pathway was significantly elevated by BCAS while suppressed by HOE treatment (Fig. 8d). The gene Cybb encoding NOX2 subunit gp91 phox was upregulated in astrocytes of the BCASVeh mice but was significantly downregulated in the BCASHOE mice (p  0.05 and FC  1.5, Fig. 8c,e). In addition, BCAS triggered significant elevation of the expression of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling related genes, including NOX2 subunit rac-related genes (Racgap1, Rhoj, Rnd1), Pro-inflammatory and ROS production enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene (Ptgs2), ROS signaling downstream genes (Mapk11), and inflammatory genes (Lcn2, Il1r1, Il2rg, Tnfsf8, Mmp9, Cxcr2, Ccl5, Itgal, etc.). In contrast, HOE642 treatment prevented upregulation of these signature genes (p  0.05 and FC  1.5, Fig. 8 c,e, and f and supplemental Fig. S10). In addition, HOE642 treatment significantly downregulated the NOX2 activator protein kinase C gene (Prkch), other ROS production genes (Nos2, Nos3, Xdh), and ROS signaling downstream transcription factor gene (Nfkb2) (p  0.05 and FC  1.5, Fig. 8c,e, and f and supplemental Fig. S10). Taken together, the bioinformatic analysis of astrocytes revealed that inhibition of NHE1 protein with HOE642 prevented BCAS-induced astrocytic transcriptome changes for ROS and inflammatory cytokines release, which collectively drive attenuation of gliosis, demyelination, and cognitive dysfunction.",

To further investigate that blockade of NHE1 protein reduced the ROS production and pro-inflammation resulting from attenuating NOX2 activity in white matter reactive astrocytes, we examined changes of expression of phosphorylated cytosolic subunit p47 (p-p47 phox) of NOX2 in astrocytes in CC and EC white matter tracts, since phosphorylation of cytosolic subunits p40, p47, and p67 is required for NOX2 activation 39. We also probed changes of LCN2 (Lipocalin 2) protein expression since it stimulates the classical proinflammatory reaction in astrocytes 40. As shown in Fig. 9, compared with the sham group, the BCASVeh mice showed abundant expression of phosphorylated p47 phox (p-p47) and LCN2 in astrocytes in CC and EC white matter tracts. The BCASHOE642 (i.p.) treatment suppressed phosphorylation of p47 phox and LCN2 protein upregulation in astrocytes (p  0.05, Fig. 9).

Among various VCID models, the BCAS model induces mild chronic hypoperfusion and simulates key characteristic pathogenesis of VCID, including white matter lesions, gliosis, inflammation 3. BCAS triggers reactive astrogliosis in the white matter 32,43, cortex, striatum, and hippocampus 44. In our study, we detected substantial activation of glial cells (GFAP  reactive astrocytes and Iba1  microglia) in the CC, EC, and hippocampus at 30 days post-BCAS, which were associated with white matter and hippocampal demyelination and microstructural damage. Importantly, chronic administration of NHE1 inhibitor HOE642 in BCAS mice significantly reduced cell counts of GFAP  reactive astrocytes and Iba1  microglia in white matter as well as in the hippocampus.

    "Correlation of brain microstructural damage, astroglial activation, and cognitive function impairment": {
      "text": "The strength of our study is that we completed cognitive behavioral tests, white matter microstructural analysis with MRI DTI, and evaluation of pathologic cellular changes with immunofluorescence staining in the same cohorts of mice, which allowed us to perform correlation analyses. Decreased FA is highly sensitive to detect white matter microstructural damage, and increased RD and decreased AD values are indicative of demyelination and axonal degeneration, respectively 34,35. We observed a linear correlation between the number of GFAP  reactive astrocytes and FA values in white matter (CC and EC), which is consistent with reports for a detrimental role of astrogliosis in white matter lesions 32, However, in addition to MRI DTI and immunostaining analysis to assess the correlation of changes in MBP and astrocytic GFAP protein in white matter tissues, future Western blot quantification could further strengthen our findings. In addition, the FA values in white matter linearly correlated with the alternation performance in the Y maze test in mice, which suggests chronic hypoperfusion injury-mediated astrogliosis contributes to white matter lesions and ensuing spatial working memory deficit. We also detected a significant correlation between the number of reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and the alternation performance in the Y maze test. Two treatment regimens with the selective NHE1 inhibitor HOE642 (cariporide) (daily bolus i.p. injection or continuous pump delivery for over 28 days) improved spatial working memory, likely due to inhibition of reactive astrogliosis in white matter and hippocampus. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage was detected as early as 1 day post BCAS surgery in mice 3,46, which can facilitate HOE642 penetration into the BCAS parenchymal brain tissues. It is also reported that intravenous administration of HOE642 in rats is neuroprotective in permanent ischemic stroke model 47, another evidence for HOE642 penetration in ischemic brains with the compromised BBB.\nHowever, some discrepancy in the correlative analysis of hippocampal astrogliosis and demyelination was detected in the HOE642 treatment (i.p.) mice, in which no improved hippocampal DTI indices (i.e. increased FA or decreased RD) were observed. The reasons for this uncoupling are not apparent. Studies have reported that increased reactive astrogliosis could also elevate FA and decrease RD in DTI metrics due to their coherent arrangement or decreased the inter-space between axons resulting from axon swelling and astrocytic hypertrophy, which mask demyelination 35,48. The lack of changes in the DTI metric values in the hippocampus of the BCASHOE (i.p.) mice could be due to the removal of the confounding influences of astrogliosis.",

    "Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein reduces astrocytic proinflammatory transcriptome changes and NOX2 complex activation": {
      "text": "The underlying mechanisms for NHE1 in glial activation and inflammation are not completely understood. Our RNA-seq analysis of isolated astrocytes revealed that inhibition of NHE1 with HOE642 treatment substantially downregulated gene expressions involved cell cycle and inflammation responses to the BCAS-induced cerebral hypoperfusion. NHE1 blockade inhibited the gene expression of NOX2 (Cybb) and its subunit rac12 activityrelated genes (Racgap1, Rhoj, and Rnd1), which are involved in the production of ROS 49. Moreover, in astrocytes of the BCASVeh mice, Prkch gene encoding protein kinase C (PKC), a key activator of NOX2 by phosphorylation of NOX2 subunits 39, was significantly upregulated, but the gene of PKC inhibitor (Ppp1r14a) was significantly downregulated. Interestingly, HOE642 treatment blocked the Prkch upregulation and Ppp1r14a downregulation, which could synergistically inhibit the phosphorylation of NOX2 subunits (p40, p47, p67). Our immunostaining data also showed that NHE1 inhibition attenuated NOX2 activity (reflected with reduced phosphorylation of the p47 subunit). In addition, the expression of the COX2 gene (Ptgst2), another important source of ROS 50 and canonical target of anti-chronic inflammation 51, was significantly reduced after the NHE1 inhibition. Inflammatory related gene product such as astrocytic LCN2 (Lcn2) plays a pivotal role in gliosis, recruitment of macrophages, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 40. Blocking NHE1 activity significantly attenuated LCN2 protein and mRNA expression in astrocytes.\nThe molecular underlying mechanisms are not known. We have previously reported that NHE1 proteinmediated H  extrusion in microglial cells prevents (See figure on previous page.)

It has also been reported that NHE inhibitors (amiloride and EIPA) have antiinflammatory effects by decreasing LPS-induced COX2 expression and production of PGE2 in the murine macrophage cells 51, which may result from the alkalinization of extracellular environment 52. Future studies are needed to determine whether NHE1-mediated regulation of pH i homeostasis in astrocytes directly modulates transcriptomes of ROS production and inflammation, and has an impact on ROS and cytokine production.\nPathological glial activation has a destructive effect on white matter integrity through their pro-inflammatory effects 53,54. Reactive astrocytes showed significantly increased pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB activation and transgenic inhibition of astroglial NF-κB signaling preserved white matter integrity and improved cognitive function in BCAS mice 55. Reactive astrocytes lost the ability to facilitate oligodendrocyte lineage cell maturation or developed abnormal glutamate metabolism 32,56. Moreover, there is close crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia in response to pathological stimuli 57. Considering that the detrimental ROS and nitric oxide (NO) from reactive astrocytes can in turn to promote the activation of microglia 57,58, the effects of pharmacological blockade of NHE1 protein in attenuating microglial activation could be indirect through reducing reactive astrogliosis andor via directly inhibiting microglial NHE1 activity, the latter was shown to be involved in stroke-mediated proinflammatory microglial polarization 17.\nA1, A2, and pan-reactive astrocyte transcriptomic signature analysis has been widely reported 37,59. We detected upregulation of genes in BCASVeh astrocytes, such as Lcn2, Serpina3n, Osmr, C3, C4b, which are wellknown pro-inflammatory markers of reactive astrocytes 36,37. These cells did not show changes in top A2 phenotype genes S100A10 or Ptx3 but displayed elevation of other A2 signature genes including Cd14, Ptgs2 that are involved in inflammatory responses. Importantly, our results demonstrated that BCAS triggered reactive astrocyte response with upregulation of a range of inflammationrelated genes (Lcn2, Serpina3n, Osmr, C3, C4b, Cd14, Ptgs2, etc.), while NHE1 inhibitor HOE642 treatment suppressed these gene transcripts. These analyses indicate that the BCAS triggered distinctive phenotypes of reactive astrocyte transformation, which does not fall in the binary A1A2 polarization, as reported recently 60.",

    "Protective effects of administration of NHE1 inhibitors in vivo": {
      "text": "Protective effects of pharmacological NHE1 inhibition have been reported in various brain injury studies. In mouse neonatal hypoxia-ischemia brain injury models, administration of NHE1 inhibitor HOE 642 (0.5 mgkg, i.p.) in neonatal mice at 10 min, 24 h, and 48 h after hypoxia reduced CC damage as well as hippocampal neurodegeneration 23,61. In the mouse model of ischemic stroke, HOE 642 (0.5 mgkgd, i.p.) given at 0-7 days post-stroke significantly decreased infarct volume, microglial activation, and pro-inflammatory stimulation, but did not attenuate reactive astrocytes in the periinfarct area 19. Moreover, in a mouse global cerebral ischemia model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, administration of another NHE1 inhibitor amiloride (10 mgkg, i.p.) after ischemia induction, significantly reduced neuronal loss, gliosis, and oxidative damage in the hippocampus 62. Lastly, in a rat spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage model, intravenous injection of HOE642 (15 mgkg) at 20 min before induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss 63. In all these prior studies, NHE1 inhibitors were administered in the acute post-injury phase, which lasted no longer than one week. In contrast, in our study, HOE642 (0.3mkkgday), administered for nearly 30 days, exhibited protective effects with improved cognitive functions and reduced brain pathology. These are encouraging new findings about the therapeutic potential for chronic NHE1 inhibition for the CCH-mediated brain damage.\nHowever, the osmotic pump administration of HOE642 in our study was less effective with the underlying mechanisms still unknown. It could be due to HOE642 instability in the saline solution 64 in the osmotic pump or cumulative toxicity resulting from higher HOE642 plasma concentrations. Studies in a cardiac disease model have reported that the chronic administration of HOE642 (30mg kgday) in rat drinking water for 1 month 65 or at 6000 ppm in mouse chow for 8 months 66 produced cardiac protective effects, without reported adverse effects. Considering the half-life of HOE642 at 3.5 h in human serum and 1.5 h in rat serum 67,68, there is a possibility that the osmotic pump with a constant delivery of HOE642 could accumulate higher serum concentrations and result in toxicity as indicated in the study by Kisker et al, that more than 5-fold increase in the area under the concentration time curve was detected in the osmotic pump delivery than in i.p. injection 69. Future studies are needed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of HOE642 via different administration routes to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Additionally, the sample sizes in our study are relatively small; despite that, we were able to determine the statistical significance for neurological deficit assessment, immunostaining, and qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analyses. Determination of the potential therapeutic benefits of NHE1 pharmacological inhibition in the CCH model is warranted with larger sample sizes.",

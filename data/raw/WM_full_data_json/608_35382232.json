    "BACKGROUND": {
      "text": "Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), along with Alzheimers disease (AD) and mixed pathologies, are predominant contributors to cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia. 1,2 Although efforts have been deployed to develop biomarkers of VCID for use in larger scale, multicenter studies including clinical trials, the lack of technical validation, including estimates of repeatability and reproducibility, disqualifies these biomarkers for use in clinical trials by regulatory agencies. 3 In recent efforts to improve early identification, staging, and prediction of risk of persons with small vessel disease (SVD) at risk for VCID for inclusion in clinical trials, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) funded the MarkVCID consortium (https:markvcid.partners.org) to identify and validate fluid-and imaging-based biomarkers for the small vessel diseases associated with VCID.\nThe MarkVCID consortium has developed standardized multi-site protocols for participant enrollment, clinical and cognitive testing, handling of fluid samples, 4 and acquisition of neuroimaging data. 4,5 Furthermore, the consortium has also selected a panel of 11 fully specified biomarker protocols (or biomarker kits) for the validation of their instrumental performance (reliability across users, sites, and time points) and clinical significance (association with clinically meaningful aspects of VCID including, for example, cognitive function or dementia rating scales).\nThe MarkVCID consortium selected seven imaging-based biomarker kits as part of this process. The present paper describes the results from the instrumental validation for three of these kits: free water fraction (FW) and peak-width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), both measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden derived from T1-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging data. FW refers to the extracellular water content contained in a voxel of the white matter (WM) tissue; reflects the amount of water molecules that are relatively unrestricted by their local microenvironment; 6 and is promoted by neuroinflammation, which increases interstitial extraneuronal space. 7 FW has been associated with vascular risk factors, including arterial stiffness and blood pressure in adult individuals 8 and with a network of inflammatory biomarkers in older individuals. 9 FW has also been reported to correlate with cognition status and its trajectory in older individuals, including cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD individuals. 10,11 PSMD represents the peak-width distribution of mean diffusivity (MD) between the 5th and 95th percentile of skeletonized FA WM tracts, with higher values indicating greater water dispersion, which has been shown to correlate with general WM microstructural damage. 12 PSMD explains a substantial proportion of variance in processing speed, the cognitive domain predominantly affected in SVD, 13 as well as visuospatial performance and general cognitive ability. 14 WMH is considered one of the paradigmatic markers of cerebrovascular disease. Multiple cross-sectional studies, including population-based studies, have found significant associations between age and cerebrovascular risk factors-particularly hypertension-and WMH burden. 15,16 Prospective longitudinal studies also show associations between WMH burden and memory and executive function decline, 17 future risk of stroke, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and death. 18 This study reports the protocol and findings for the instrumental validation of the FW, PSMD, and WMH kits.

The second compartment is the tissue compartment, which accounts for all other molecules, that is, all intra-and extracellular molecules that are hindered or restricted by tissue membranes. 6 The script contains the following steps: (1) the tissue compartment is modeled by a diffusion tensor characterizing the tissue molecules, as well as the fractional volume of the FW compartment in each voxel, resulting in the FW fraction map; (2) the individual FA map obtained from DTIFIT is linearly and non-linearly registered to the standard FSL FA template space (FMRIB 1-mm FA template) using linear and nonlinear transformations, (3) the resulting transformation parameters are applied to the FW map, (4) a WM mask is defined by thresholding the FSL FA template at a value of 0.3 to reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume contamination, 22 (5) an overall measure of mean FW is computed by superimposing the WM mask onto the individual coregistered FW fraction map and averaging values within these WM voxels and ( 6) an overall measure of mean FW fraction is stored in a text file.",

The algorithm will return a four-component (CSF, gray matter, WM, and WMH) grayscale segmented image volume in the native space of the 3D T1-weighted volume along with a segmented mask of WMH.\nA step-by-step analytic plan has been described previously. 24 It includes (1) linear co-registration of 3D T1-weighted image to the FLAIR image, (2) removal of non-brain elements from the FLAIR image using 3D T1-weighted brain mask, (3) image intensity normalization of the FLAIR image, (4) non-linear warping of 3D T1weighted brain image to a minimal deformation template, 25 (5) nonlinear deformation of the FLAIR volume to the atlas using the registration parameters for the 3D T1-weighted volume, ( Each of these imaging-biomarker kits includes a protocol, the script, and instructions; these are available on the MarkVCID website (https: markvcid.partners.orgconsortium-protocols-resources).

    "Inter-rater reliability": {
      "text": "Inter-rater reliability evaluates differences between values obtained for MRI biomarker kits by raters at different sites analyzing the same MRI data. Each kit included a protocol, video tutorial, and example data that allowed investigators and staff from the participating sites to train on their own and to apply the kits to the 20 datasets shared by the MarkVCID coordinating center. ICC of absolute agreement of biomarkers between raters (i.e., participating sites), for MRI scanners present in the consortium, was above 0.94 for the three kits (see Results section) reflecting excellent inter-rater reliability for FW, PSMD, and WMH kits.\nBecause FW, PSMD, and WMH are generated by automatic algorithms, we expected that variability introduced by human interaction to be negligible. Potential variability may originate from the input files used by these kits: pre-processed DTI data (i.e., data corrected for eddy current and brain masked) and brain mask for the FW and PSMD kits and T1 and FLAIR raw volumes and brain mask for the WMH kit. Although the inter-rater reliability for PSMD was excellent, follow-up discussions with participating sites revealed that a source of heterogeneity was that, whereas most images were collected at a 2 mm  2 mm  2 mm resolution, data sets from the GE machine were interpolated to a 1 mm  1 mm  2 mm resolution at the scanner. Some sites downsampled the data to 2 mm  2 mm  2 mm resolution before using the kit (UCSF, RUSH, JHU, and UTHSCSA). The sites that did not downsample the data had slightly higher PSMD values (see Figure 2). When only considering site pairs with identical pre-processing, overall ICC AA was 0.996 (P  .001, 0.992; 0.998) among UCSF, RUSH, JHU, and UTHSCSA and 0.993 (P  .001, 0.985; 0.997) among UKY, UNM, and USC. Interestingly, FW was not found to be susceptible to whether data were down-sampled or not during preprocessing (see Figure 1).\nAlthough preprocessing of DTI images is not part of the FW or PSMD kit, strict uniformity across sites can be obtained if the processing is encapsulated within a container. This step would also ensure that all sites use the same software versions. Although the use of a container will be considered in future kit versions, at present users are encouraged to carefully harmonize preprocessing steps, as well as check the quality of input images, including the presence of artefacts or the generation of the brain mask. FW, PSMD, and WMH kits have several strengths. They were proposed based on prior literature for their endpoint role in imaging studies evidencing association between these measures and SVD and cognition. 8,10,11,13,14,17,323334 The kits are publicly available on markvcid.partners.org website. Finally, training documents, example data sets, and video tutorials are also provided. There are, however, several limitations to these three imaging-based biomarker kits. First, although we demonstrated that FW fraction, PSMD, and WMH burden were reliable in the test-retest analysis, the present study does not address whether these measures are sensitive biomarkers of WM change over time. Previous works support that changes in FW fraction, PSMD, and WMH burden may be detectable over time. 10,17,32 Further longitudinal studies are needed to characterize the smallest detectable change for each biomarker. Second, this study did not address whether FW, PSMD, and WMH measures are associated with cognition measures.",

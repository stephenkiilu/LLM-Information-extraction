    "abstract": "Few studies have looked at the potential of using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in conjunction with machine learning algorithms in order to automate the classification of healthy older subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here we apply DTI to 40 healthy older subjects and 33 MCI subjects in order to derive values for multiple indices of diffusion within the white matter voxels of each subject. DTI measures were then used together with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify control and MCI subjects. Greater than 90 sensitivity and specificity was achieved using this method, demonstrating the potential of a joint DTI and SVM pipeline for fast, objective classification of healthy older and MCI subjects. Such tools may be useful for large scale drug trials in Alzheimers disease where the early identification of subjects with MCI is critical.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between healthy aging and Alzheimers disease (AD), characterised as a non-disabling disorder that represents an early state of abnormal cognitive function 1. Although not all MCI cases represent prodromal AD, an estimated 10-15 of MCI subjects enter the dementia spectrum every year. In contrast, 1-2 of healthy older people convert to AD each year 1. Therefore, MCI is frequently considered to be a good target for the early diagnosis of AD 1,2. Future drugs for AD, such as amyloid-modifying compounds, may fail to affect the clinical course of AD when neurodegenerative processes are well established, but it has been suggested that these drugs may have greater success in the very earliest stages of AD before the onset of symptoms 3. Therefore, fast and objective tools for the diagnosis of MCI will be of great interest for future research into the understanding of MCI and AD, as well as for drug development in AD. Existing cognitive batteries which are used for the diagnosis of MCI and AD such as the CERAD 4 are both subjective and extremely time consuming.\nHere we wish to develop a method of combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) together with support vector machines (SVMs) 5 which may be used to supplement existing cognitive batteries during the diagnosis procedure. DTI probes white matter (WM) structure by exploiting the fact that water diffuses faster along the main axis (l 1 ) of fibers compared with diffusion perpendicular to fibers (l 2, l 3 ) 6. Four primary indices of diffusion can be assessed -fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusion (DA) and radial diffusion (DR) 7.\nAlthough WM damage has been found in AD both in postmortem studies 8 and in vivo studies 9 little attention has been focused on the potential of using DTI tools to classify MCI and AD subjects. However, this is likely to prove a fruitful area of research as WM damage may be a key indicator of early AD pathology 10.\nTo date, machine learning techniques have been applied to a range of MRI modalities in an effort to automate the diagnosis of MCI and AD. This includes, the use of volumetric analysis of the hippocampus combined with logistic regression 11 as well as the combination of support vector machines (SVMs) with grey matter (GM) data from voxel based morphometry (VBM) 12,13. A combination of structural MRI with PET data has been found to increase accuracy when using SVMs 14. Risk scores for MCI conversion to AD have been created with VBM data using principal component analysis (PCA), structural equation modelling (SEM) and SVM approaches 5,12,13,15,16. Cortical thickness studies have been used to classify AD and control scans 17 while cross-sectional pattern analysis studies have been used to classify control and MCI subjects 18. Machine learning techniques have also proved to be effective for the classification of MCIs which convert to AD at follow-up and those that remain stable 19,20.\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate how multiple indices of diffusion can be used in conjunction with SVMs for the classification of control and MCI subjects. We wanted to assess the efficacy of each index of diffusion for classification. We also wanted to assess the locations of the voxels that were most useful for discriminating between groups. We hypothesized that the most useful voxels for classification would be located in areas that are known to be compromised in the early stages of AD. Previous studies have indicated that atrophy in the early stages of MCI and AD are subtle and distributed in a number of regions including the hippocampus, the lateral and inferior temporal structures, the anterior and posterior cingulate, the uncinate fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus 212223.",

MCI patients were diagnosed using criteria for both amnestic and non-amnestics sub-groups 24. Neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 25 and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery 4. For the diagnosis of MCI, the following must be present:\n1. objective impairment on any neuropsychological test from the CERAD battery based on a cut-off of 21.5 SD below published normative data corrected for age and education of the subject; 2. cognitive impairment corroborated by a close family member; 3. essentially normal activities of daily living; 4. must not meet criteria for dementia as defined below.\nMCI individuals with objective memory impairment were diagnosed as having MCIa and those with non-memory impairment were diagnosed as having MCIna.\nDiagnostic criteria of AD were that of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (NINCDS-ADRDA) working group 26. MCIna and MCIa participants were recruited at the Adelaide and Meath Hospital incorporating the National Childrens Hospital (AMNCH), Dublin, Ireland. Healthy control participants were recruited among relatives of MCI subjects and also through advertisements in the local community.\nParticipants were excluded if they had cortical infarction, excessive subcortical vascular disease, space-occupying lesions, depression, and any other psychiatric or neurological disease. Participants were also excluded on magnetic resonance imaging criteria such as pacemaker implant, recent metallic implants, and claustrophobia. The DTI and structural scans of the cohort used in the current study were previously used in a study of mixedeffects models 27 and in a study of the role of multiple indices of diffusion in MCI and AD 21.",

    "DTI Processing": {
      "text": "DTI analysis was performed using TBSS 29. Images were skull stripped with the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from the FSL library 30. Raw DTI images were first corrected for motion and eddy current effects. The diffusion tensor was then calculated with the DTIFIT program for whole brain volumes and the resulting FA maps, together with the DA (l1) and DR ((l2l3)2) and MD ((l1l2l3)3) maps, were used in subsequent TBSS analysis.\nTBSS performs a non-linear registration that aligns each FA image to every other one and calculates the amount of warping needed for the images to be aligned. The most representative image is determined as the one needing the least warping for all other images to align to it. The FSL library also provides a 1 mm isotropic FA target image (FMRIB58_FA) in standard space, which is sometimes used instead of the most representative image from the study cohort. This can be problematic as the target image is based on a young healthy brain. Using the method of all subject to all subject registration is more computationally intensively, but highly desirable when dealing with populations other than young healthy controls.\nAfter this registration step, warped versions of each subjects FA image were generated which were then averaged and a white matter skeleton was then created suppressing all non-maximum FA values in each voxels local-perpendicular direction and subsequently comparing all remaining non-zero voxels with their nearest neighbours, thus searching for the centre of fibre bundles. The skeleton was then thresholded at an FA value of 0.2 which limits the effects of poor alignment across subjects and ensures that GM and CSF voxels are excluded from the skeleton. The resulting skeleton contained WM tracts common to all subjects. A distance map is then created which is used to project each FA image onto the mean FA skeleton that is common to all subjects 29. The same non-linear transformations derived for the FA maps were applied to the DA, DR and MD maps.\nFollowing TBSS processing, a global region of interest was created using the white matter skeleton that is common to all subjects. Mean values of FA, DA, DR and MD were extracted from each subject using this global ROI in order to generate boxplots for control, MCIna and MCIa groups for each index of diffusion.",

There were 130,394 voxels in the WM skeleton and diffusion values for all indices of diffusion were extracted from each voxel in the WM skeleton.

      "text": "The first step of the WEKA analysis was to reduce the number of voxels to those that are most relevant for classification. This step eliminates non-discriminative voxels which would reduce classification accuracy. The feature selection algorithm ReliefF 33 was used to extract the most important voxels from the full FA, DA, DR and MD datasets that contain diffusion values from every voxel in the entire white matter skeleton of each subject. For each classification group and also for each index of diffusion, seven reduced datasets were created as follows:\n1. 100 voxel dataset 2. 250 voxel dataset 3. 500 voxel dataset 4. 750 voxel dataset 5. 1000 voxel dataset 6. 2000 voxel dataset 7. 3000 voxel dataset.\nTherefore in total, 14 reduced datasets were created; i.e. 7 reduced datasets for Control and MCI classification, and 7 reduced datasets for Control, MCIa, and, MCIna classification. The choice of the size of these reduced datasets is based on previous work using a similar approach to the one outlined in the current study 20,34. To date, ,500-1000 voxels have been found to give optimal classification results.\nThe aim of the ReliefF algorithm is to estimate the quality of voxels according to how well the value of a voxel distinguishes between instances that are near to each other. The algorithm works on the assumption that the voxels of nearby individuals with different diagnoses are the most useful for assessing the predictive ability of the voxel. The current method employs feature selection on the entire dataset which has been used in previous studies 20,34 while other studies have employed nested cross validation 35,36. See the discussion for a note on this point.\nAfter reducing the data into datasets of differing sizes, classification was then performed using the SVM algorithm sequential minimal optimization (SMO) 37 with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel 38. SVMs are algorithms that learn how to assign labels to objects 5. They use linear models to implement nonlinear class boundaries by transforming the input into a new higher dimensional space (Fig. 1a). In this way, a straight line in the new space can be curved or non-linear when transformed back to the original lower-dimensional space (Fig. 1a). Following transformation, a linear model called the maximum margin hyperplane is created. To visualise this, imagine a dataset with two-classes that are linearly separable. The maximum margin hyperplane is the one that gives the greatest separation between the classes. The hyperplane describes a straight line in a highdimensional space, and therefore a separating hyperplane is a line that separates the classes (see Fig. 1b). The instances that are closest to the maximum margin hyperplane are called support vectors. A unique set of support vectors defines the maximum margin hyperplane for the learning problem. Once the support The projection of the data from low dimensional space to higher dimensional space is achieved with a kernel function. The optimal kernel function is usually found by trial and error. In the current study a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used to nonlinearly map samples into a higher dimensional space. RBF kernels use two parameters: C and GAMMA. GAMMA represents the width of the radial basis function, and C represents the errortrade-off parameter that adjusts the importance of the separation error in the creation of the separation surface. C was fixed to 1 and GAMMA was fixed to 0.01.\nOnce the SVM has been trained, a new test subject can be labelled, based on the distance between the subject and the separating hyperplane. The distance is used by the classifier to determine, via Platts method 39, the probabilistic score for the subject and the subject is labelled based on the sign of the score. Platts method uses a sigmoid function to enable receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to be generated. The approach applied here is to train an SVM first, and then to train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. The mathematical framework for this model is described in detail by Platt 39. The SMO handles multi-class (i.e. .2 groups) problems using pairwise classification. In the multi-class case the predicted probabilities are coupled using Hastie and Tibshiranis pairwise coupling method 39.\nClassification accuracy was evaluated via 10 times 10-fold cross validation to ensure performance generalization. For each run of 10-fold cross validation, the data is randomly divided into 10 parts in which each class is represented in approximately the same proportions as in the full dataset. Each fold is held out in turn and the learning scheme trained on the remaining nine-tenths and the error rate is then calculated on the tenth fold. Thus the learning procedure is executed a total of 10 times on different training sets. The 10 error estimates are averaged to yield an overall error estimate. This procedure was repeated 10 times, resulting in the learning algorithm being implemented 100 times on datasets that are all nine-tenths the size of the original 31,32. This is a standard procedure in machine learning which reduces the variation related to data selection and allows results to be averaged to yield robust calculations of the performance of the SVM.\nFor the analysis of results, measures of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the curve for the receiver operated characteristic curve (AUC ROC) are shown. Accuracy is defined Sensitivity is defined as TP(TPFN) and Specificity is defined as TN(FPTN).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The current results show that it is possible to classify control and MCI subjects with a high degree of accuracy using an automated procedure that combines DTI with SVMs. Our results from control versus MCI classification which achieved a sensitivity of 93.0 and specificity of 92.8 compare favourably with previous work using DTI or structural VBM data for MCI classification. The findings are extended to three group classification (control, MCIna, MCIa), with the FA index again returning the best performance with a sensitivity of 92.2 and a specificity of 93.4. To put these results in perspective, one of the most frequently used criteria for AD classification are the NINCDS-ARDA guidelines 26 which have a sensitivity of 81 and specificity of 70 40. Therefore, the current automated approach adds to a growing body of evidence that MRI can be combined with machine learning algorithms to detect subtle structural damage in the early stages of Alzheimers disease 20,12,13,15,18. The current results are also in broad agreement with a recent SVM study which used DTI measures for the automated diagnosis of MCI subjects 36. Wee and colleagues adopted a two stage feature selection pipeline that incorporated Pearson correlations and an SVM-RFE algorithm 41,42. This two stage sieving process is in contrast to the use of a single algorithm (ReliefF) for feature selection in the current study. The combined use of multiple indices of diffusion together with fiber count measures provided Wee and colleagues with an enriched classifier which produced an accuracy of 88 for control and MCI classification which is comparable to the accuracy achieved in the current study. Interestingly, a number of recent machine learning papers, agree with the current findings that the FA index is the optimal diffusion index for MCI and AD classification 20,34,36.\nThe current work also identifies the regions selected by the ReliefF program that are most useful for successful classification. For the classification of control and MCI groups, areas of the forceps major and the splenium were found to be particularly useful for this two group classification. Both of these regions have been shown to be compromised in MCI in previous studies 43. This is of interest as the forceps major connects the temporal and parietal cortices and passes through the splenium 44. This result is consistent with findings that the tempo-parietal connections may be affected in MCI via damage to the splenium. Previous studies have also found the splenium to be damaged in AD 45,46, while in MCI, GM volume loss has consistently been localised to the medial temporal lobes and posterior cingulate 47,48.\nFor the classification of three groups (control, MCIna and MCIa) ReliefF selected a significant cluster in the forceps major overlapping closely with the cluster selected for two group classification. A significant cluster in the fronto-occipital fasciculus (FOF) 49 was also identified. This also agrees with previous work that has found the FOF to be compromised in MCI and AD 50,51. We should stress that the ReliefF algorithm is attempting to find the most useful voxels that will aid the classification task that is defined for each particular experiment. Thus the 500 voxels that ReliefF selects for Control versus MCI classification will not be exactly the same as the 500 voxels selected for three group classification.\nJoint TBSSSVM analysis allows information to be harnessed from the entire brain, which is a significant advantage over the ROI approach that is frequently focused on the temporal lobe 52. The current methodology obviates the need for the labour intensive selection and creation of ROIs and consequently, the approach outlined here may be suitable for use in a clinical setting. The clinical methods used by the NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines are very time consuming, while an automated approach would potentially facilitate a more efficient and objective way to streamline classification. The need for accuracy in the classification of MCI subjects is underlined by the fact that the MCIa group is at greatest risk from developing AD, while those with MCIna may progress to other forms of dementia 26. A method which can stratify these two MCI subgroups will be of use both in the clinic and in large scale drug trials.\nAlso comparable to our results, a recent study has achieved accuracy rates of 90 when distinguishing control versus MCI Here we show a cluster of voxels selected by the algorithm which is located in the forceps major. (b) Classification of control, MCIna and MCIa groups. For this classification of three groups, the highest accuracy was again achieved with the FA index. Here we show two significant clusters of voxels selected by Relieff. Similar to the two group classification, the forceps major was also implicated in three group classification. An additional significant cluster is located in the frontooccipital fasciculus. Both (a) and (b) show the same sagittal slice in the right hemisphere (x  29). doi:10.1371journal.pone.0032441.g009 using GM, WM and CSF volumes in conjunction with SVMs 18. Previous PET studies have achieved 84 sensitivity at 93 specificity for the classification of control versus very mild probable AD cases 53. PET has also been used to distinguish between AD and vascular disease with an accuracy of 80-86 accuracy 54. Overall, our results compare favourably with accuracy rates to date, while the robustness and generality of the current method is ensured by the use of 10 times 10-fold cross-validation 32. This method of cross validation reduces the effect of random variation when different folds are selected 31.\nSome limitations of the study should be noted. In order to further validate the current findings, training and classification on multi centre data is now warranted. This is currently being pursued as part of the European DTI Study in Dementia (EDSD) initiative. For this future study the feature selection method using ReliefF will be incorporated into a nested cross-validation. While the current approach uses a feature selection framework similar to previous studies 20, this approach may be overly optimistic due to selection of features from the full dataset. The future validation of the current framework will also incorporate an assessment of a single enriched parameter based on a combination of all diffusion indices. The cross-sectional nature of the current data should also be noted. We do not have follow-up data and thus do not know which participants subsequently developed AD or alternatively remained stable without deteriorating further. A key aspect of machine learning in Alzheimers disease is the distinction between progressive and stable forms of MCI. However, while such an analysis is not possible in the current cohort, a longitudinal study using the machine learning methodology outlined here is planned.\nOverall, the current study demonstrates the use of DTI in conjunction with SVMs as a powerful tool for MCI classification that may be of potential use in the clinic. A fully automated procedure of this kind is an appealing alternative to cognitive batteries which are both subjective and time consuming. The pipeline outlined in the current study aims to create an SVM classifier that successfully learns the structural differences between MCI and normal healthy older people. The results are encouraging and suggest that this framework may provide a novel and efficient approach to the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in the future.",

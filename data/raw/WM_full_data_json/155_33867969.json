    "abstract": "To explore the evaluation of white matter structural network analysis in the differentiation of Alzheimers disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), 67 participants 31 AD patients, 19 SIVD patients, and 19 normal control (NC) were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent 3.0T MRI scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed by graph theory (GRETNA toolbox). Statistical analyses of global parameters gamma, sigma, lambda, global shortest path length (Lp), global efficiency (E g ), and local efficiency (E loc ) and nodal parameters betweenness centrality (BC) were obtained. Network-based statistical analysis (NBS) was employed to analyze the group differences of structural connections. The diagnosis efficiency of nodal BC in identifying different types of dementia was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. There were no significant differences of gender and years of education among the groups. There were no significant differences of sigma and gamma in AD vs. NC and SIVD vs. NC, whereas the E g values of AD and SIVD were statistically decreased, and the lambda values were increased. The BC of the frontal cortex, left superior parietal gyrus, and left precuneus in AD patients were obviously reduced, while the BC of the prefrontal and subcortical regions were decreased in SIVD patients, compared with NC. SIVD patients had decreased structural connections in the frontal, prefrontal, and subcortical regions, while AD patients had decreased structural connections in the temporal and occipital regions and increased structural connections in the frontal and prefrontal regions. The highest area under curve (AUC) of BC was 0.946 in the right putamen for AD vs. SIVD. White matter structural network analysis may be a potential and promising method, and the topological changes of the network, especially the BC change in the right putamen, were valuable in differentiating AD and SIVD patients.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "According to a report from the World Health Organization in 2017, almost 50 million people have been diagnosed with dementia, and the number is said to increase to 82 million by 2030 (The Lancet Neurology, 2018). Dementia creates a heavy financial burden on society. Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive and degenerative disease resulting in cognitive impairment and behavior dysfunction. Vascular dementia (VaD) due to various vascular pathologies is the second most common cause of dementia after AD (Kang et al., 2016). AD and VaD accounts for approximately 60 and 20 of dementia, respectively (Rizzi et al., 2014). Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) accounts for a large part of VaD (Benjamin et al., 2016). SIVD has been focused on due to its high prevalence.\nIt is hard to identify SIVD and AD clinically, due to the similar neuropsychological symptoms between them. The main issues for SIVD patients are executive and semantic memory dysfunction (Palesi et al., 2018). Previous studies demonstrated that the cognitive impairment of SIVD was related to the disconnection of the frontal subcortical circuit (Seo et al., 2010). The progression of SIVD was reversible as the vascular risk factors of SIVD were controllable. However, AD patients mostly displayed diffuse cortex atrophy and the progress was irreversible (McDonald et al., 2009).\nThe microstructure of the human brain has been explored in vivo by neuroimaging in recent years. Many studies have proved that the cognitive impairment of SIVD resulted from a lesion in the white matter (Chen et al., 2018). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acknowledged as a precise MRI method, which is sensitive to the microstructural change of white matter. In the past couple of decades, the topological network has received great attention in neuroscience study. The network is comprised of information of relations or interconnections that link many elements in the neurobiological system. The neurons of the human brain are interconnected through synaptic connections and anatomical projections mediate the communication among brain areas, forming a highly complex network system in human beings (Bassett and Sporns, 2017;Kuang et al., 2020). Structural network analysis based on DTI is a newly-developed method to reflect the topological structural alterations and the connectivity of the brain structural network (Bassett et al., 2017). The graph theory method, a branch of mathematics, could offer important new insights into the structure and function of brain network systems including their architecture, evolution, and development (Sporns, 2018).\nDTI has been applied in many studies to explore white matter changes in patients with AD and SIVD by voxel-or tract-based methods (Chen et al., 2018;Palesi et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019). However, the human brain is a complicated and interconnected network balancing regional segregation and the specialization of function with strong integration (Zhou et al., 2020). The clinical syndromes of AD and SIVD, such as executive dysfunction and memory deficits, might result from abnormal structural connections. Due to the analogical clinical manifestation of AD and SIVD, it is hard to identify them by only relying on clinical performances. Brain network analysis may help researchers understand cerebral microstructure change, and may further elucidate the etiology of cognitive and behavioral deficits in SIVD patients. In the present study, we aim to explore brain structural network alterations in AD and SIVD patients, and to explore the value of brain structural network analysis in the differentiation of AD and SIVD.",

      "text": "A total of 67 right-handed Chinese Han subjects 19 SIVD,31 AD,and 17 normal control (NC) were enrolled in this study at the Department of Radiology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2018 to June 2020. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation. All subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test and 3.0 Tesla MRI scanning of the whole brain. The cognitive functions of all the subjects were evaluated by an experienced neuropsychologist. General cognitive function of participants was evaluated using the Beijing version of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and the mini mental state examination (MMSE; Lu et al., 2011). Episodic memory function was assessed by the auditory verbal learning test Huashan version (AVLT) including the auditory verbal learning test immediate recall (AVLT-IR) and the auditory verbal learning test delayed recall (AVLT-DR; Zhao et al., 2012). Executive function was assessed by the Stroop color-word test. The speed (Stroop test 1) and the accuracy (Stroop test 2) of performance were measured.\nIncluded SIVD patients met the following criteria (Román et al., 2002;Liu et al., 2014;Kang et al., 2016): (1) displayed moderate and severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The severity of WMH was evaluated according to the modified Fazekas ischemia criteria. WMH were assessed separately as periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMH) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) in T2 axial or fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. DWMH were classified into D1 (10 mm), D2 (10 mm 25 mm), or D3 (25 mm) based on the longest diameter of lesions. PWMH were split into P1 (cap and band  5 mm), P2 (5 mm, 10 mm), or P3 (cap or band 10 mm) based on the maximum length, which were perpendicular and horizontal to the ventricle, respectively. These two ratings were combined as minimal (D1P1, D1P2), moderate (D1P3, D2P1, D2P2, D2P3, D3P1, D3P2), or severe (D3P3); (2) lacunar cases: multiple lacunas (5) in the deep gray matter and at least moderate white matter lesions; and (3) with a MoCA score less than 26.\nThe inclusion criteria for AD patients referred to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association Criteria (McKhann et al., 2011). Besides, AD patients in our study also met following criteria: (1) absence of WMH or mild severity of WMH by T2 FLAIR image; and (2) with a MoCA score less than 26.\nAccording to the score of MoCA, the AD patients and SIVD patients were subdivided into mild cognitive impairment (18MoCA 26) and dementia (MoCA17).\nNC were age and gender-matched healthy volunteers:\n(1) without clinical evidence or history of cognitive disfunction with MoCA26; (2) without brain abnormality detected on a routine non-contrast MRI examination; and (3) no neuropsychological disorders.\nThe exclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: (1) metabolic conditions, such as hypothyroidism or folic acid deficiencies; (2) a history of stroke; (3) central nervous system diseases that could cause cognitive decline, such as Parkinsons disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and so on; and (4) with MRI scanning contraindications.",

When tracking white matter fibers, a fractional anisotropy (FA) value threshold of 0.2 and a turning angle threshold of 45  of the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm were set (Basser et al., 2000).\nThe Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) atlas was used to parcellate each brain into 90 regions of interest (ROIs). The nodes of the structural network were defined according to the AAL template. Interconnections between brain regions were taken as the edges of the structural network. If the number of interconnected white matter fibers was more than 3, an edge in the structural network was defined. The global topological parameters including the small-world gamma, sigma, lambda, and global shortest path length (Lp), global efficiency (E g ), and local efficiency (E loc ) were obtained by the GRETNA toolbox (Wang et al., 2015). E g indicates how efficiency information is exchanged over the whole network. E loc calculates clustering and specialization within a network and the fault tolerance of the network. Lp, a measurement of the average nodal shortest path length, reflects the speed information transfer to the whole brain. Sigma, the ratio of gamma and lambda, is a measurement of the small-world property of the network. In addition, the betweenness centrality (BC) of a node was measured to describe nodal characteristics of the white matter structural network. BC is the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through a given node.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "According to the present study, executive dysfunction was significantly different between the SIVD and AD groups. SIVD patients performed worse in the Stroop color-word tests than AD patients. SIVD patients spent more time on Stroop test 1 (lower speed) and namingreading errors (lower accuracy) occurred more frequently than in AD patients, as shown in Table 1. 3,4. AD, Alzheimers disease; SIVD, subcortical ischemic vascular dementia; AUC, area under curve.\nIt was indicated that the executive function of SIVD patients was more seriously damaged. Subcortical vascular pathology which interrupted frontal-striatal circuits was frequently present in SIVD patients. Executive dysfunction in SIVD patients may result from the disruption of cortical and subcortical connections (OBrien and Thomas, 2015;Tuladhar et al., 2015). Many studies suggested that memory deficit was more obvious in AD patients. However, the SIVD group performed worse than the AD group in the present study (Graham et al., 2004;Reed et al., 2007). Liu et al. (2019) found that memory loss existed in the deteriorated process of SIVD patients and memory decreased with cognitive deterioration. Moreover, there were studies that proved that memory deterioration was correlated with the overall severity of dementia (Kang et al., 2016). Thus, the discrepancy supposedly resulted from the impartial distribution of global cognitive severity. DTI and the graph theory method were applied to explore the structural network alteration of AD and SIVD patients. In the present study, AD and SIVD patients and NC performed small-world properties. Small-world organization, reflecting an optimal balance of integration and segregation, appears to be a ubiquitous organization of anatomical connectivity (Bassett and Bullmore, 2006;Zhou et al., 2020). Sigma is a measurement of small-world property in the structural network (Sun et al., 2017). The decreased sigma in the structural network indicates a less optimal topological structure. Although there were no significant differences in sigma between AD and NC and SIVD and NC, it did not indicate that the small-world topological properties of AD and SIVD were normal. Because sigma was calculated by dividing gamma by lambda, the sigma value could be affected both by the gamma value and lambda value. Lambda is the ratio of the characteristic path length between real and 100 random networks, which quantifies the overall routing efficiency of a network (Zhang et al., 2019). The lambda values of SIVD and AD patients were obviously increased in the present study. It was suggested that the network integration in SIVD and AD patients was disrupted. E g and E loc respectively measures the ability of parallel information transmission over the network and the fault tolerance of the network (Zhang et al., 2019). The E g and E loc in SIVD patients and E g in AD patients were significantly reduced compared with NC, which indicated that global integration of the structural network was disrupted and information processing was impaired in the AD and SIVD groups (Bai et al., 2012). Lp, a measurement of the average of the nodal shortest path length, reflects the speed of information transfer to the whole brain (Li et al., 2017). Significantly increased Lp in SIVD indicated the disrupted global integration of the structural network. When SIVD patients compared with AD patients, SIVD patients performed lower E g , E loc and higher Lp, lambda, suggesting that the destruction of white matter structure in the SIVD group was worse than that in the AD group.\nBC is the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through a given node (Fortanier et al., 2019). Decreased nodal BC means reduced nodal importance in the network. Compared with NC, AD patients demonstrated significantly reduced BC in the left precuneus. A previous study found that inappropriate atrophy existed in the precuneus in AD patients and the precuneus played an important role in the default mode network (Abu-Akel and Shamay-Tsoory, 2011;Hojjati et al., 2018). Besides the left precuneus, AD patients showed decreased BC in parietal and prefrontal cortices, such as the right postcentral, left superior parietal gyrus, right rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), and left superior frontal gyrus (medial part). Some studies suggested that atrophy of the AD brain may initiate in the inferior parietal cortices and spread to the prefrontal cortices (McDonald et al., 2009). These structural alterations may be linked to the corresponding BC changes in these regions and illuminate one of the underlying reasons of cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.\nExecutive dysfunction is the main clinical symptom of SIVD patients which may be correlated with the integrity of prefrontalsubcortical circuits (Román et al., 2002). Compared with NC, the BC of the left anterior cingulate gyrus in SIVD patients was significantly decreased in the present study. The cingulum, a complex structure that interconnects the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal regions (Bubb et al., 2018), plays an important role in executive function and episodic memory. The impairment of the cingulum may result in an executive dysfunction and memory deficit in SIVD patients. Additionally, the BC was decreased in some prefrontal cortices such as the right superior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus (orbital part), and right inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part), as well as in the right putamen and right superior occipital gyrus in SIVD patients. Some researchers suggested that the volume of the putamen was smaller and that the occipital gyrus was thinner in SIVD patients (Seo et al., 2010;Thong et al., 2014). The occipital gyrus is the main origin and destination of long-association fibers, among which the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus plays an important role in attention and visual processing. Therefore, alterations in the structural occipital gyrus may lead to function deficits in attention and visual processing (Catani and Thiebaut De Schotten, 2008).\nThere were some differing main brain regions involved in the structural network in AD and SIVD patients. It was suggested that the left precuneus was vulnerable to damage in AD patients while the right putamen was vulnerable to damage in SIVD patients in the present study. The prefrontal and frontal cortices and subcortical regions were the main regions affected in the SIVD group which was consistent with a previous study (Yi et al., 2012;Thong et al., 2014). As to the diagnostic efficiency of nodal BC in differentiating SIVD and AD patients, the AUC of the right putamen was 0.946 which was the highest. Therefore, the change of BC in the right putamen could identify and distinguish SIVD patients and AD patients.\nStructural connections in frontal-prefrontal regions, frontalsubcortical regions, and prefrontal-subcortical regions were reduced in SIVD patients in the present study. Previous studies demonstrated decreased frontal-subcortical connections in SIVD patients (Sang et al., 2020), which was in line with the present study. Besides, the structural connections between prefrontal and frontal regions were reduced which supposedly resulted in their damage in SIVD patients. AD patients mostly manifested decreased structural connections in the temporal and occipital regions and increased connections in the frontal and prefrontal regions in the present study. In the study of McDonald et al. (2009), AD patients with mild cognitive impairment suffered from atrophy of the temporal and occipital cortices. Structural alterations in the temporal and occipital cortices may explain the decreased structural connections in these regions which are related to function deficits. However, increased structural connections in the frontal and prefrontal regions could potentially compensate for function deficits in AD patients.\nAs discussed above, although most of the conclusions from the present study were similar with those from previous studies, there were still many new findings. First, the structure of the precuneus was deconstructed in AD patients, which illuminated part of underlying reasons for cognitive dysfunction, while AD patients had increased prefrontal-frontal structural connections, which were supposed to compensate for function deficits. Second, the structure of occipital cortices were impaired in SIVD patients, which pertained to the function deficits of attention and visual processes. Finally, the BC change of the right putamen had the highest AUC in the ROC analysis, suggesting that it was suitable to differentiate between SIVD patients and AD patients.\nThere were several limitations in the present study. First, the sample size of the SIVD group was quite small, which needs to be enlarged in future studies. Second, the intraindividual and intra-group differences in global cognition were not considered sufficiently. Although there were no statistical differences in MMSE and MoCA scores between AD and SIVD patients, and there was no statistical difference in the distribution of severity of cognitive dysfunction between AD and SIVD patients, the confounding factor of the severity of cognitive impairment existed. AD and SIVD patients need to be further subdivided in a future study. Third, the AD patients were recruited by clinical criteria which had not been proved by pathology.",

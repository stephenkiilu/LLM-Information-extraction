    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allow in vivo investigation of molecular motion of tissue water at a microscopic level in cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). DWIDTI measure of water diffusion has been proven to be invaluable for the study of many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimers disease and Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease) that predominantly involve GM. Thus, quantitative analysis of GM diffusivity is of scientific interest and is promised to have a clinical impact on the investigation of normal brain aging and neuropathology. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for analysis of GM diffusivity in 76 standard anatomic subdivisions of gray matter to facilitate studies of neurodegenerative and other gray matter neurological diseases. The computational framework includes three enabling technologies: (1) automatic parcellation of structural MRI GM into 76 precisely defined neuroanatomic subregions (76-space), (2) automated segmentation of GM, WM and CSF based on DTI data, and (3) automatic measurement of the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in each segmented GM subregion. We evaluate and validate this computational framework for 76-space GM diffusivity analysis using data from normal volunteers and from patients with Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Early detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimers disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD)) would provide clues to the underlying neuropathology of these diseases and would enable more effective treatment of patients (Nestor et al., 2004). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provide insights into the nature and degree of gray and white matter injury that occurs in neurological diseases and shed light on early detection and diagnosis of devastating neurological diseases. DTI is in wide use for the investigation of white matter (WM) abnormality associated with various progressive neuropathologies (Stahl et al., 2003;Horsfield and Jones, 2002;Sundgren et al., 2004;Moseley, 2002) because it yields quantitative measures reflecting the integrity of WM fiber tracts. These measures rely on the directionally constrained (Fanisotropic_) water diffusion in human brain WM related to the dense bundling of myelin sheaths. Although these DTI studies on WM are useful in investigation of the abnormality occurring on fiber pathways connecting remote computation centers of various Gray Matter (GM) regions, many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, primarily involve the GM (Horsfield and Jones, 2002;Brun and Englund, 1986). Fortunately, water diffusivity in GM is nearly isotropic, and scalar diffusivity quantified by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflects pathologic change in a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Sundgren et al., 2004).\nInvestigation of brain diffusivity in AD over the past decade (Hanuy et al., 1998;Rose et al., 2000) has culminated in recent reports suggesting that DWI may help predict progression to AD in patients with Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Kantarci et al., 2005). In addition, DWI has been shown to be useful in the investigation and diagnosis of vascular dementia (Choi et al., 2000), post-procedural cognitive impairment following cardiac surgery (Restrepo et al., 2002) and in Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) (Young et al., 2005). In CJD, the combination of diffusion-weighted MRI and FLAIR demonstrated over 90 sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in differentiation of CJD from other dementias, with high intra-and inter-reader reliability (Young et al., 2005). Recently, the utility of DWIDTI has also been investigated in many other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinsons disease (Adachi et al., 1999), multiple sclerosis (Cercignani et al., 2000) and schizophrenia (Kalus et al., 2005).\nTo date, many applications of DWI for quantification of GM diffusivity for clinical diagnosis of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases have been done via manual region of interests (ROI) analysis (Bilgili and Unal, 2004). To manually parcellate the entire brain cortex into well-established cytoarchitectonic regions, such as the 76 spaces employed in this paper (Table 1), would require a well-trained neuroanatomist days or weeks. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to perform statistical studies of the GM diffusivity over large datasets of subjects. In this paper, we report a novel computational framework which allows automated 76-space analysis of GM diffusivity throughout the entire cortex of brains of normal volunteers and patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease. We evaluate and validate this computational framework for 76-space GM diffusivity analysis using data normal volunteers and from patients with Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease. A brief description of the framework is referred to Liu et al. (2005a,b).",

    "Overview": {
      "text": "The computational framework of 76-space analysis of GM diffusivity is composed of seven steps, as summarized in Fig. 1. The first two steps automatically segment the spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) brain image into distinct tissues of CSF, GM and WM (Liu et al., 2004a), and the GM is further parcellated into 76 finedetailed neuroanatomic regions (Table 1) using the high-dimensional hybrid registration method (Liu et al., 2003(Liu et al., , 2004a(Liu et al., ,b, 2005a,b),b). The third step performs pre-processing in the DWIDTI space, e.g., the eddy current correction, ADCFA (fractional anisotropy) image generation, reslicing and co-registration of the DWIADCFA images with the SPGR image.\nOwing to the potential problems such as EPI geometric distortion (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995), partial volume effect (Helenius et al., 2002;Gonzalez Ballester et al., 2002), image reslice errors and inaccuracy of co-registration, the warped b0 ADCFA images would not be in exact anatomic correspondences with SPGR image. The inaccurate alignment of ADCFA images with SPGR image prevents us from directly applying the GM parcellation in the SPGR space to the ADCFA images, in that the GM in SPGR space may correspond to heterogeneous tissues, e.g., CSF and WM, in the DWIDTI space. To overcome this problem, Steps 4 and 5 segment the brain into CSFGMWM tissues in the DWIDTI space by utilizing the tissue contrasts existing in ADC image and FA image. Afterwards, Step 6 combines the tissue segmentation results from both SPGR space and DWIDTI space and takes the intersection of the GM maps in both spaces. This AND-like operation of GM maps results in a GM-intersection map, which is classified as GM by both SPGR image segmentation and DWIDTI image segmentation. Finally, we apply the neuroanatomic parcellation of GM-intersection map obtained in the SPGR space to the ADC image and perform the 76-space analysis of GM diffusivity, represented by Step 7 in Fig. 1.",

      "text": "We employed a hybrid volumetric and surface warping method (Liu et al., 2003(Liu et al., , 2004a,b) ,b) to automatically segment the brain SPGR image into a variety of neuroanatomic structures. In the first step, a feature-based volumetric registration algorithm is used to warp a model cortical surface to the individuals space (Liu et al., 2004a;Shen and Davatzikos, 2002). This step greatly reduces the variation between the model and individual and provides a good initialization for the next step of surface warping. In the second step, a surface registration method based on matching geometric attributes warps the model surface to the individual. The geometric attribute vector, as the morphological signature of surface, was designed to be as distinctive as possible, so that each vertex on the model surface can find its correspondence on the individual surface (Liu et al., 2004a). The evaluations and validations of the hybrid warping method are referred to Liu et al. (2003Liu et al. ( , 2004a,b),b).\nAfter the high-dimensional hybrid registration (Step 2 in Fig. 2) and atlas-based warping (Step 3 in Fig. 2), the subject brain image is segmented into a variety of neuroanatomic structures, as shown in Fig. 2d. Meanwhile, we apply automatic tissue segmentation (Step 4 in Fig. 2) on the subjects SPGR image (Figs. 2c andf) and use the resulting GM map (Fig. 2g) to mask the automatically labeled SPGR image (Fig. 2d), generating the labeled GM map (Fig. 2e). These procedures are in Step 5 and Step 6 in Fig. 2. In this way, only the GM regions agreed in both maps are maintained. Finally, we remove other non-GM tissues by looking at the GM neuroanatomy table (Table 1) to obtain the 76 GM structures (Fig. 2h) for the following step of 76-space analysis (Step 7 in Fig. 2). This masking process eliminates erroneous GM mappings caused by registration inaccuracy, which is akin to the ANIMAL  INSECT merging strategy in Collins et al. (1999). The procedure for 76-space GM parcellation is summarized in Fig. 2.",

We calculate the diffusion tensors from diffusion-weighted images using in-house built software to generate the ADC and FA images. Then, we co-register the b0 (no diffusion Fig. 2. Procedures for automatic parcellation of GM into 76 regions in SPGR space. gradient) image, ADC image and FA image with the structural SPGR image using the linear multimodality registration method of Oxford FSL Flirt (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). To obtain better co-registration accuracy, we further apply a nonlinear registration method of UCLA AIR (Woods et al., 1998) to produce a better coalignment between ADCFA images and the structural SPGR image, which is akin to those in Xu et al. (2003) and Pfefferbaum et al. (2000).",

    },
    "Motivation": {
      "text": "Although the Oxford FSL Flirt and UCLA AIR algorithms can produce reasonably good co-registration results, two reasons still render the possibility that GM regions in SPGR space correspond to heterogeneous tissues (e.g., CSF and WM) in the DWIDTI space, and moreover, measurements of GM diffusivity may fail to reveal real changes occurring in the GM tissue if we directly apply the GM segmentation in the SPGR space into the DWIDTI space. Small errors in the alignment of ADC image and SPGR image may place CSF tissue of the ADC image onto GM tissues on the structural SPGR image. Given that the GM is a laminar with thickness of about 3.0 mm, and the ADC values of the CSF are more than twice as high as the GM values (Pierpaoli et al., 1996;Helenius et al., 2002), small errors in co-registration may lead to significant deviation of the measured ADC value in the GM region. Fig. 3 illustrates the problem of heterogeneous tissues when directly applying SPGR segmentation to DWIDTI space. Fig. 3d is the GM map segmented from SPGR image (Fig. 3a). After applying this SPGR GM segmentation to mask ADC image (Fig. 3b), we have the GM ADC map (Fig. 3e). As highlighted by the yellow arrows in Fig. 3e, it is clear that certain CSF tissues are included in the GM ADC map. These erroneously included heterogeneous CSF tissues would greatly affect the accuracy of ADC measurement in those regions. With an alternate method of confirmation, we overlay the boundaries of GM segmented in SPGR image onto the ADC image, as shown in Fig. 3h. Clearly, SPGR GM boundaries (red) are crossing the CSF in the ADC image. The results in the Heterogenous tissue removal subsection will show that, on average, 15 of GM segmented in SPGR image would be overlapped on CSF on the ADC image, even after linear and nonlinear co-registration of ADC and SPGR image in the pre-processing step.\nSimilarly, as shown in Figs. 3c, f and i, direct application of the SPGR GM segmentation to ADC image would also erroneously include heterogeneous WM tissues into the GM ADC map, which would slightly decrease the measured ADC values in GM as the ADC value of WM is a little lower than that of GM. The yellow arrows emphasize the WM areas that are erroneously included into the GM ADC map. On average, 17 of GM segmented in SPGR image would be placed on WM tissues on the ADC image, which will be shown in the Heterogenous tissue removal subsection later. We have shown that the problem of heterogeneous tissues is severe when directly placing SPGR GM segmentation to DWIDTI space. The underlying reasons causing this problem are multiple. First, there could be geometrical distortions in EPI-generated diffusion tensor images (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995). Ideally, these geometrical distortions could be corrected or reduced during MR imaging (Chen and Wyrwicz, 2001;Zeng et al., 2004), or a field map would be optimal for such geometric distortion correction (Reber et al., 1998). But in its absence, post-processing procedures (Studholme et al., 2000;Munger et al., 2000) could be used to reduce the geometric distortions as much as possible.\nSecond, there is partial volume effect (PVE) in MRI, which arises in volumetric images when more than one tissue type occurs in a voxel. The voxel intensity depends not only on the imaging sequence and tissue properties but also on the proportions of each tissue type present in the voxel (Tohka et al., 2004;Gonzalez Ballester et al., 2002). It has been shown that the partial volume effect of the CSF adjacent to the cortex may increase the ADC values in the GM (Helenius et al., 2002), which further complicates the situation when we apply the SPGR GM segmentation into the DWIDTI space. Preferably, the PVE could be suppressed during imaging, e.g., by using the FLAIR DWI imaging sequences aiming at suppression of CSF contamination (Papadakis et al., 2002;Latour and Warach, 2002;Kwong et al., 1991). However, given DWIDTI images generated by conventional imaging sequences without CSF contamination suppression, we need post-processing techniques that take the PVE effect into account in order to obtain accurate measurement of GM ADC values.\nThird, in typical DWIDTI imaging settings, the diffusionweighted images might have larger slice thickness, e.g., 3.0 -4.0 mm, than SPGR images. It is usually necessary to reslice the DWI ADCFA images into a higher resolution so that the resliced images would have the same inter-slice and in-plane resolution as the SPGR image, thus facilitating subsequent processing and analysis. Inevitably, the reslicing would generate certain inaccuracies, since certain degree of detailed neuroanatomic information missed during imaging could not be recovered by interpolation. Fourth and finally, the accuracy of co-registration could be limited, although the nonlinear co-registration by AIR (Woods et al., 1998) can align the DWIADCFA images with SPGR image with reasonable accuracy, and, to some extent, alleviate the problem of heterogeneous tissues.\nAltogether, the aforementioned four factors or a subset of them cause the problem of heterogeneous tissues, even though it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify how much each factor contributes to the problem. Our solution to this problem is to remove the heterogeneous tissues in the GM ADC image by utilizing tissue contrasts existing in the ADC and FA images. Actually, the ADC values of the CSF are more than twice as high as the GM and WM values because water diffusion in CSF is much less restricted than that in the GM and WM tissues (Pierpaoli et al., 1996;Helenius et al., 2002). Therefore, it is feasible to use ADC image to segment CSF from non-CSF tissues. Meanwhile, FA image can be used to separate WM from non-WM tissues, since highly directional white matter structures have much larger fractional anisotropy values. More importantly, ADC image and FA image are intrinsically in the same DWIDTI space, and we can combine the CSFnon-CSF and WMnon-WM segmentation results into a complete GMWMCSF segmentation in the DWI DTI space. After taking the intersection of the GM map in SPGR space and the GM map in DWIDTI space, we can substantially remove heterogeneous tissues on the GM ADC image.",

    "Tissue classification": {
      "text": "Tissue classification performed on SPGR image or other structural images has been extensively investigated, and a couple of successful methods are available in the literature (Dale et al., 1999;Zhang et al., 2001;Wells et al., 1996;Pham and Prince, 1999). A commonly used method to evaluate and validate tissue segmentation algorithm is by digital phantoms, e.g., the digital brain phantom developed at the Montre al Neurological Institute (Cocosco et al., 2003;Kwan et al., 1999). To the best of our knowledge, digital DTI phantoms are currently not available. Therefore, at this stage, we evaluate our tissue classification on ADC and FA images by measuring the volume agreement and volume overlap between the segmentation results in DWIDTI space and that in SPGR space. The volume agreement for a particular tissue type (CSF, GM or WM) is defined as:\nwhere V i is the tissue volume in SPGR space, and V j is the volume of the same kind of tissue in DWIDTI space. This definition implies that similar tissue volumes mean a higher volume agreement.\nAs an example, Figs. 5a andb show the color-coded tissue maps obtained in SPGR and DWIDTI space respectively. For this case, the volume agreement of CSF, GM and WM are 0.91, 0.94 and 0.89. To evaluate volume agreement of tissue classification in SPGR and DWIDTI space over larger datasets, we applied the multichannel tissue classification for additional fifteen cases of normal brains. The average volume agreements for CSF, GM and WM over the fifteen cases are 0.92, 0.94 and 0.88. For comparison, we also applied tissue classification to the channel of T2-weighted image for these fifteen cases, and the average volume agreement for CSF, GM and WM between SPGR channel and T2 channel are 0.91, 0.92 and 0.97. For CSF and GM, the volume agreements between SPGR and ADCFA channels are even slightly higher than those between SPGR and T2 channel. This result partly verified that performing tissue classification in DWIDTI space could achieve good consensus in terms of tissue volume with that of structural images and provide complementary information. Notably, the volume agreement for GM between SPGR and ADCFA channels is the highest, which is desirable for GM diffusivity analysis. Meanwhile, the volume agreement for WM is the lowest, which might be due to the fact that the HMRF-EM algorithm tends to under-segment WM on FA channels.\nThe volume overlap of two tissue maps is defined as:\nwhere T i is the tissue map in SPGR space, and T j is the same type of tissue in DWIDTI space. The 7 operator takes the intersection of two",

    "Multichannel fusion": {
      "text": "We now have tissue classification results obtained from three channels: SPGR image, ADC image and FA image. The SPGR channel has the complete segmentation of CSF, GM and WM (Fig. 4b), whereas the ADC channel has the segmentation of CSF and non-CSF (Fig. 4f), and the FA channel has the segmentation of WM and non-WM (Fig. 4j). The multichannel fusion is to take the intersection of the SPGR GM map (Fig. 4c), the ADC non-CSF map (Fig. 4g) and the FA non-WM map (Fig. 4k) by performing an AND-like operation (AND 1) on these three maps, thus generating a GM-intersection map as shown in Fig. 4o. This AND-like operation ensures that the GM-intersection map is the consensus of all three channels and substantially removes heterogeneous tissues in the GM ADC image.\nTo demonstrate the heterogeneous tissue removal by multichannel fusion, Fig. 4d shows the overlap of SPGR GM map (Fig. 4c) and ADC CSF map (Fig. 4h) by using the AND-like operation (AND 2). These large areas of overlapped heterogeneous tissues could give rise to significant increases of GM diffusivity measurement. Likewise, Fig. 4p is the overlap of SPGR GM map (Fig. 4c) and FA WM map (Fig. 4l) (AND 3). These large areas of overlapped heterogeneous tissues could result in decreases in the GM diffusivity measurement, since the ADC value of WM is slightly lower than that of GM (Helenius et al., 2002).\nUsing the method in the GM parcellation in SPGR space subsection, we automatically parcellate the GM into 76 spaces (Fig. 4m). Then the GM-intersection map (Fig. 4o), the labeled GM map (Fig. 4m), and the original ADC map (Fig. 4e) are combined together (AND 4), and finally, we have the GM ADC image (Fig. 4n) for 76space analysis of GM diffusivity, e.g., for each labeled neuroanatomical GM region in Fig. 4m, we measure its average ADC value based on Fig. 4n.",

To visually evaluate its performance, Figs. 6a andb show overlay of the boundaries of final GM-intersection map (Fig. 4o) on ADC and FA images respectively. Here, the GM boundaries are not crossing CSF or WM tissue, indicating that heterogeneous tissues are removed. The yellow arrows highlight the areas where large heterogeneous tissues existing in Fig. 3 but now are removed after multichannel fusion.\nA side-effect of the proposed multichannel fusion is that certain GM regions are shrunk due to the removal of heterogeneous tissue. Fig. 7 illustrates the volume-shrinking effect of GM caused by multichannel fusion. The yellow arrows spot the GM areas where there is significant volume shrinkage. Totally, there is 31.6 volume decrease after multichannel fusion, in which 17.6 is because of heterogeneous CSF removal, and 14 is due to heterogeneous WM removal. This result further verifies that the problem of heterogeneous tissue is severe and might have significant influence on the GM diffusivity measurement if they are not removed. Additional results of volume shrinkage for fifteen cases are provided in Fig. 8. The average volume shrinkage percentages caused by the removal of heterogeneous CSF and WM over these fifteen cases are 15 and 17 respectively, which designates that the problem of heterogeneous tissue is common. Put in another way, without heterogeneous tissue removal, there would be 32 of the GM tissues overlapping with other heterogeneous tissues, and measuring their ADC would be problematic, if neuroanatomic structures or ROIs are defined on the SPGR image.\nTo quantitatively demonstrate the removal of heterogeneous CSF and CSF-contaminated GM achieved by the proposed method, Fig. 9",

    "ADC measurement": {
      "text": "In this subsection, we demonstrate that multichannel fusion could substantially improve the accuracy of ADC measurements compared to that without heterogeneous tissue removal. As an example, Fig. 10a compares ADC measurements of the 76 GM neuroanatomic structures (Table 1) with and without heterogeneous tissue removal. Not surprisingly, the results without heterogeneous CSF removal (red curve) have significantly higher ADC values in comparison with the results with heterogeneous CSF removal (yellow curve). Averaging over the 76 GM structures, heterogeneous CSF causes an increase of 9 of the ADC measurement. For certain GM structures, such as the right thalamus (structure index of 63), the increased ADC measurement caused by heterogeneous ventricular CSF reaches 29. Notably, this result is proved by both visual inspection and expert manual labeling.\nAlso shown in Fig. 10a is that after both heterogeneous CSF and WM removals (blue curve), the average ADC measurement slightly increases by 2, compared to that after heterogeneous CSF removals (yellow curve). This is expected, as the ADC value of WM is lower than that of GM, and the removal of heterogeneous WM would decrease the ADC measurement. Overall, there is still a significant difference (9 decrease  2 increase) between the results before and after heterogeneous tissue removal (difference between the red curve and the blue curve). These results support the conclusion that heterogeneous tissues, especially CSF, would significantly deviate ADC measurement of GM structures from true values, if they were not properly removed.\nAs an example, Fig. 10b shows the GM ADC histograms of structure No. 63 (right thalamus) in Fig. 10a before and after heterogeneous tissue removal. It is apparent that tremendous heterogeneous CSF and CSF-contaminated GM is removed after the multichannel fusion. This explains the significant difference between the ADC measurements of the right thalamus before (1.26 Â 10 À3 mm2s) and after (0.88 Â 10 À3 mm 2 s) the multichannel fusion procedure.",

We randomly selected two normal subject datasets (MRI imaging settings described in the GM diffusivity study of normal brain subsection), and two neuroanatomy experts manually painted 40 randomly selected GM ROIs, which are marked by stars in Table 1. The manual tracing was performed on the ADC image directly, with avoidance of including heterogeneous tissues in GM. In the first case, the average differences between algorithm result and manual labeling 1 and 2 over the 40 GM ROIs are 1.2 and 6.4 respectively. The maximum differences are 11.4 and 16.1 respectively. As for case 2, the average differences are 6.1 and 8.3, and the maximum differences are 15.9 and 17.4 respectively. Overall, the average difference between algorithm result and manual labeling is about 5.5, which is reasonably low considering the inter-rater difference of 5.2. Notably, there are a few GM areas where the differences are substantial, e.g., greater than 10. These relatively larger differences might be caused by the disagreement between manual anatomic delineations and those obtained by automated algorithms.\nBecause of the time requirements for the accurate tracing of all the brain GM structures, at current stage, we have focused on the 40 randomly selected GM structures, rather than carrying out a wholebrain validation. The experiments in the GM diffusivity study of Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease subsection further performed comparisons between manual ROI analyses and the automated method using CJD datasets, which could be served as additional validations.",

Our results also show that there is no significant difference ( P value  0.05) between the right and left side hemisphere in terms of average diffusivity.\nTo visualize these results for normal brains, we map the average ADC value of each GM structure in Table 2 onto the GMWM surface of a brain atlas and color-code these ADC values in graphic rendering, as shown in Fig. 11.

    "GM diffusivity study of Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease": {
      "text": "Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease presenting with dementia, often accompanied by motor and psychiatric symptoms, related to neuronal injury caused by accumulation of prion protein (Young et al., 2005). Current diagnostic criteria for probable sporadic CJD (85 of cases) require a combination of specific neurological symptoms in addition to either a characteristic EEG, with one hertz periodic epileptiform discharges, or demonstration of the 14-3-3 protein in CSF. Definite CJD cases require pathologic confirmation by brain biopsy or autopsy. For this reason, the highly accurate diagnosis of CJD is made possible by DWI (Young et al., 2005;Shiga et al., 2004).\nWe applied the 76-space analysis to datasets from four of the CJD patients (2 males and 2 females, ages 77, 53, 35, 21) imaged at UCSF Medical Center and reported previously (Young et al., 2005;Liu et al., 2005b). The structural imaging settings are 1.5 T GE Signa MR system; sagittal series of contiguous spoiled gradient images; and voxel dimensions: 0.9375 Â 0.9375 Â 1.5 mm. The DTI settings are as follows.

Our results showing much lower ADC values than normal volunteers in the putamen, thalamus and globus palladus are in agreement with other published reports (Tschampa et al., 2003). The measured ADC in right and left putamen dropped by 29 and 26 respectively, compared to those of normal brains. Although the CJD patients and normal controls in this study are not age-matched and gendermatched, we believe that the comparison results are meaningful since these changes are far larger than reported as age-related or gender-related ADC variation (Helenius et al., 2002).\nIn addition to involvement of GM structures known to be commonly involved in CJD, the 76-space analysis method also detected a variety of other GM regions with much lower ADC values. To confirm, we performed manual ROI analysis for a number of GM structures suspected to have lower ADC values. All of the manual tracings were performed on ADC images using the Display software disseminated by the Montreal Neurological Institute.\nFor the first CJD case, two experts performed manual ROI analysis for the left medial front-orbital gyrus, the left middle occipital gyrus, the right and left putamen, the right and left globus palladus and the right and left thalamus. Fig. 12a shows the manual tracing results by expert 1 (blue bar) and expert 2 (yellow bar), the computerized result (green bar) and the ADC values of the normal brain (red bar) as well for comparison. Both manual and computerized results indicate that the left medial front-orbital gyrus (Index 12), the left middle occipital gyrus (Index 48), and the right and left globus palladus (Index 61 and 62) have considerably lower ADC values than those of normal brains. The manual tracing results also agreed with the computerized results in that the right and left putamen (Index 59 and 60), and the right and left thalamus (Index 63 and 64) have relatively normal ADC values. Similarly, Fig. 12b shows the results for the second CJD case. Here, ROI structures include the right and left precuneus, the left middle occipital gyrus, the right and left putamen, the right and left globus palladus, the right and left thalamus, and the right and left nucleus accumbens. In this case, both manual and computerized results stated that all of these GM structures have noticeably lower ADC values than those of normal brains, indicating their involvements in CJD. Fig. 13a provides the results for the third case, in which ROI structures include the right and left putamen, the right and left globus palladus, and the right and left thalamus. In this case, only the right putamen has obviously lower ADC value than that of normal brain, while other GM structures have similar ADC values as those of normal brains. The results for the fourth case are shown in Fig. 13b. The right and left putamen, the right and left globus palladus, and the right and left thalamus are targeted for manual ROI analysis, and all of these six structures have clearly lower ADC values than those of normal brains.\nIn summary, our results show strong agreement between automated and manual results, verifying that the automated method of 76-space analysis is comparable to manual ROI analysis in terms of accuracy in measuring GM diffusivities. Our results also demonstrate that the proposed methodology robustly can be applied to data acquired from differing population groups and different scanners. The results here are exemplary of the applicability of the proposed methodology. Application of the methodology to larger dataset would be our future work.",

      "text": "We have demonstrated that more accurate measurement of GM diffusivity could be achieved by removing heterogeneous tissues via multichannel fusion. However, a fundamental assumption in this paper is that we can accurately measure GM diffusivity although we use only part of GM tissue, that is, the intersection of the GM obtained in SPGR space and that in DWIDTI space. One could attempt to make the GM maps in two spaces overlap as much as possible, e.g., via the reduction of geometric distortion in DWI DTI space and improvement of co-registration, but it is always preferable to take the intersection of GM maps if the GM parcellation in SPGR space is applied to DWIDTI space. In the present work, we have not investigated how much would the removal of heterogeneous tissue deviate the diffusivity measurement from the true one. To do that, we would need the use of digital DTI phantoms. This issue will need to be addressed in our next step.\nAs mentioned before, about 32 of GM tissue was shrunk due to heterogeneous tissue removal through multichannel fusion. We expect that less GM tissue could be removed by improvement of co-registration of DWIDTI images and SPGR images in the future. Notably, in Pfefferbaum and Sullivan (2003), a promising way to combat the problem of heterogeneous tissues influencing the observed diffusion measures by erroneously including GM and or CSF in the WM region was examined by systematic application of morphological operators to the circumscribed WM. This method is applicable to WM, but whether or not it is applicable to GM will need future investigation, given that the GM is a laminar with thickness of only about 3.0 mm.\nTo obtain CSFGMWM tissue classification in the DWIDTI space, we have used two independent channels of ADC image and FA image. Potentially, other channels such as eigenvalues of the tensor, relative anisotropy (RA) and volume ratio (VR) could also be used for such purposes. The channels eigen values 1, 2 and 3 could be used to separate CSF from non-CSF tissues, in that there are clear contrasts between them in these images. Meanwhile, the RA image and VR image might be useful to divide WM from non-WM tissues. We intend to examine the optimal combination of these channels for the purpose of tissue classification in DWIDTI space in the next step. It should be noted that, currently, the ability to test the validity of this segmentation is limited in the absence of access to histological data or digital phantom. The issues related to evaluation and validation of tissue classification in DWIDTI space need future investigations.\nADC maps may be calculated from either DWI or DTI (as in this paper). For our purposes, DTI is required in order to calculate the FA maps needed to allow removal of heterogeneous voxels containing WM from the GM ADC maps. The idea of using ADC and FA images for tissue classification has been previously employed in Maas et al. (2004) to segment newborn brain images into subplate and nonsubplate. In this paper, we use ADC and FA images to segment brain tissue into CSFGMWM. In general, there is a strong overlap between the ADC distributions of GM and WM, meaning ADC can hardly differentiate GM from WM. Also, there is a strong overlap between the FA distributions of GM and CSF, and the FA image has very limited power to separate GM from CSF. Fortunately, in our application, a single channel does not necessarily have the capability to differentiate three types of brain tissues. An outstanding advantage of conducting tissue classification in DWIDTI space is that all images (e.g., ADC, FA, trace, eigenvalues and RA) are intrinsically in the same space, and they do not need any co-registration between them. Therefore, two complementary channels (e.g., ADC and FA) are adequate to classify the whole brain into three tissue classes given that one channel can separate one tissue type from others. The optimal combination of complementary channels is to be investigated in the future.\nIn this paper, the result of SPGR image segmentation is used to guide the initialization of ADC and FA image segmentation. On the other hand, pursuing tissue classification in DWIDTI space independent of SPGR image might be of interest in certain applications. For example, tissue classification based on T2weighted image might not be able to accurately lineate out putamen and thalamus, as shown in Fig. 14b. But tissue segmentation based on ADC and FA images can achieve good results in Fig. 14e. White arrows point to putamen and thalamus areas where tissue classification in DWIDTI space has better results than that based on T2-weighted image. In applications without structural image, development of robust initialization methods for the HMRF-EM segmentation, which is independent of SPGR image segmentation, would be of high interest. It should be pointed out that the sensitivity of the proposed 76space analysis to subtle and local changes in GM diffusivity is limited, since ADC values are averaged over a whole GM neuroanatomic structure. In this way, subtle and localized diffusivity changes would be smoothed out and have only small influences on the average ADC value of the whole structure. As a result, the 76-space analysis cannot discover those subtle and localized ADC changes, but the analysis can identify abnormal structures with large and ADC changes occupying a majority of a single cytoarchitectonic cortical region, as shown in the GM diffusivity study of Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease subsection. In the future, we will try to split the 76-space into more detailed anatomic regions, so that subtle and localized changes of GM diffusivity could be detected.",

      "text": "Although the framework of 76-space analysis aims at automated quantification, the multichannel fusion methodology may also be applied in manual ROI analysis of GM diffusivity, in which ROIs may be placed on structural images (e.g., SPGR image) and should be mapped to DWIDTI space (Tanner et al., 2000). The multichannel fusion procedure could substantially remove the heterogeneous tissues (CSF and WM) overlapped on the manually labeled GM on SPGR image.\nIn this paper, ADC images are used to segment CSF from non-CSF tissues for both normal brains and diseased brains. As confirmed here, ADC values are lower in patients with Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease than in normal brains, a fact that should enhance the separation of CSF from other tissues, rather than impair the power of ADC images to separate CSF and non-CSF tissues. However, in certain neurological diseases, e.g., Alzheimers disease, pathologic destruction of cell membranes, with subsequent loss of myelin and axonal processes due to wallerian degeneration and consequent reduction in extracellular barriers to water diffusion in the hippocampus and afferent white matter tracts would cause increased ADC observed in these regions (Kantarci et al., 2001). To what extent the ADC changes due to the presence of diseases would cause problems in the tissue segmentation in ADC images needs further investigation. Similar issues should also be investigated for tissue segmentation in FA images when FA values changes due to the presence of diseases.\nIt is possible that the changes in diffusion parameters in diseased brains occur near the edges of the gray matter, and thus, the algorithms in this paper could possibly be poorer at discriminating between healthy and abnormal tissues. This might affect the results of the 76-space analysis of gray matter diffusivity. This issue would be investigated in our future work by using specific MRI datasets and carefully designed experiments.\nThe DWIDTI and SPGR datasets of normal controls and CJD patients used in this paper were scanned by different MRI machines in separate medical centers. It is well known that different MR imaging settings could result in systematic bias. But we argue that MR imaging bias would not reach such an extent that invalidate the results in the GM diffusivity study of Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease subsection because they are consistent with reports by neuroradiologists in Young et al. (2005). In future work, we would investigate how MR imaging settings would affect the results of our computational methods, e.g., by using phantoms, and develop the desired method to make corrections to the bias.\nThe assessment of diffusivity in brain tissue is a complicated issue (Engelter et al., 2000;Meier-Ruge et al., 1992), which is affected by the viscosity of the medium, barriers to diffusion between compartments, molecular crowding, presence of active transport, bulk flow in capillaries and the length of diffusion observation. GM diffusivity may vary not only in different age groups but also in different gender groups. We will evaluate the proposed 76-space analytic method with larger datasets of agematched and gender-matched groups in future work.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "We proposed a new computational framework for automated 76-space analysis of GM diffusivity for study of normal brains and neurodegenerative diseases. In this framework, structural information in SPGR image and diffusivity information in DWIDTI images are integrated and explored through three enabling technologies: high-dimensional hybrid registration, tissue segmentation based on DWIDTI data and multichannel fusion. The framework has been applied to study data from normal volunteers and CJD patients and produced meaningful results. For future work, we plan to further improve and validate our computational framework and to apply the method to larger datasets and to other neurological diseases, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease.",

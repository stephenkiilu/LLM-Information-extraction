    "abstract": "The purpose of this explorative study was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameter changes are reliable measures of white matter integrity changes in Alzheimers disease (AD) patients using a whole brain voxel-based analysis (VBA). Therefore, age-and gender-matched patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n  18), dementia due to AD (n  19), and age-matched cognitively healthy controls (n  14) were prospectively included. The magnetic resonance imaging protocol included routine structural brain imaging and DKI. Datasets were transformed to a population-specific atlas space. Groups were compared using VBA. Differences in diffusion and mean kurtosis measures between MCI and AD patients and controls were shown, and were mainly found in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiata. Hence, DTI and DKI parameter changes are suggestive of white matter changes in AD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Structural and functional disruptions in the relationship between anatomically distinct brain regions occur in patients with dementia, supporting the notion of a molecules as they diffuse in the brain. Due to the highly organized nature of the WM, the main diffusion orientation will generally coincide with the orientation of the axons in this tissue. Therefore, DTI can characterize the orientation and integrity of WM fibers 3,4. Increased mean diffusivity (MD) and decreased fractionalanisotropy(FA)havebeenfoundinmildcognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia as compared to controls 5. The differences between MCI and controls are similar to those found between AD and controls, although fewer regions reached statistical significance 5. In addition, a correlation between cognitive decline and reduced FA and increased MD has been demonstrated in AD 6.\nDTI has limitations with respect to quantitative analysis as well as to qualitative fiber tractography 7,8. Despite the high sensitivity of DTI to detect WM damage, its specificity to discriminate between different micro-structural WM changes and between different brain disorders remains relatively low 9. Therefore, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was introduced 10. Based on the estimation of non-Gaussian diffusion, DKI parameters can be calculated. In addition, by estimating Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion, more accurate DTI parameters can be obtained 11. A growing list of publications reported the ability of DKI to provide additionalsensitiveparameters,suchasmeankurtosis(MK), radial kurtosis, axial kurtosis, and fractional kurtosis anisotropy, to detect developmental and pathological changes in neural tissues, as compared to conventional DTI 121314. There is evidence that the kurtosis parameters are good probes for the presence of membranes and other barriers and that they are sensitive for detecting changes in permeability 10,15. Therefore, DKI mayrevealnewinsightsinthephysiologyofcellsduring pathological states and may be useful for investigating abnormalitiesintissueswithisotropicstructureinwhich techniques such as DTI are less useful 16.\nArecentstudy,usingmanualregion-of-interest(ROI) analysis, has shown decreased radial kurtosis and MK in the WM of the parietal lobe in AD as compared to MCI 17. Another study, also using manual ROI analysis,founddecreasedMK,radialandaxialkurtosisvalues in specific brain regions in AD as compared to controls. Comparing MCI and controls, fewer regions reached statistical significance 18.\nAs DKI provides an insight into structural connectivity changes, this potential and non-invasive biomarker reflects a different pathophysiological aspect of AD as compared to the existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers that reflect the neuropathological state of AD and might not only improve diagnostic accu-racy for early AD but could also have a predictive value with regard to disease progression. This explorative study aimed at evaluating whether DTI and DKI parameter changes are measures of WM integrity changes in AD patients using a whole brain voxel-based analysis (VBA).",

A multi-slice, single-shot EPI, spin echo sequence (TRTE  7700139 ms) was used to obtain 40 axial slices without slice gap and 2.2 mm nominal isotropic resolution (FOV  220  220 mm). Diffusion weighting was applied according to an optimized diffusion gradient encoding scheme that consisted of 25, 40, and 75 diffusion weighted gradients, isotropically distributed over three shells with b  700, 1000, 2800 smm² respectively. In addition, 10 non-diffusion weighted images (b 0 ) were acquired. The acquisition time was 16 min.",

      "text": "Motion correction was performed by aligning all diffusion-weighted images with an affine transformation to the non-diffusion-weighted image. Thereafter, a b-matrix rotation was performed, to ensure that the orientation information of the diffusion tensors is correct in each voxel 21.\nThe diffusion and kurtosis tensors were then calculated using the DKI model 11 in every voxel using a weighted linear least squares method with well-chosen weights to obtain a bias free estimation 11,22,23. Subsequently, the FA, MD, and MK quantitative maps were calculated. The following steps were included in the processing pipeline to construct an atlas and align all subject data in the same atlas space:\n1. All DTI data sets were transformed to the FA map of a randomly selected subject with an affine transformation using Multimodality Image Registration using Information Theory based on the FA maps 24. 2. A population specific DTI atlas was constructed from these affinely aligned data sets 25,26. This atlas was made from the 51 data sets, and thus represents an average brain of the AD, MCI, and healthy subjects. As the tensor information is present in the atlas, it can be used to drive the nonaffine registration of the following step, resulting in a highly accurate image registration result. 3. The affinely coregistered data sets were transformed to the population-specific atlas using a viscous fluid based non-rigid coregistration algorithm that was adopted to include all tensor information during the iterative alignment procedure 27,28. The preservation of principal direction tensor reorientation strategy was thereby incorporated 29.\n4. Both the affine and non-affine deformation fields were then applied to all original quantitative maps, in order to align them in the same populationspecific atlas space. 5. All aligned images were smoothed by an adaptive, anisotropic smoothing kernel (FWHM  6 mm) 30. This spatially dependent, anisotropic kernel was estimated from the FA maps and subsequently applied to the FA and MD images.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this explorative study, diffusion tensor and kurtosis measures were compared between MCI and AD patients and controls. The studys novelty is the fact that DKI, an innovative MRI technique, is used as well as that the group-wise comparisons are performed with VBA. Moreover, the patient population was thoroughly characterized and all MCI and AD diagnoses were biomarker based according to the NIA-AA research criteria for AD. Twelve patients represented with conflicting AD biomarkers. However, the CSF concentration of A 1-40 was not analyzed in this study, which would probably increase the number of patients with characteristic AD biomarker profiles 36373839.\nUsing VBA, one of the major assets of the study, DTI and DKI parameters were analyzed at the voxel level in the whole brain. This allows for an explorative analysis, as no hypothesis should be made regarding the spatial location of the expected differences. In addition, since no regions have to be outlined manually, this analysis approach is observer-independent. Additionally, ROI analysis is labor-intensive and time-consuming, as 3D structures need to be delineated by 2D ROIs on different slices. Finally, a clear hypothesis on the location of expected diffusion differences is needed in the ROI analysis approach 40.\nThe reliability of VBA results depends on the accuracy of the image registration, which is especially challenging in patients with AD because performing a voxel-based diffusion MRI analysis on elderly subjects, and more specifically on AD patients, is very challenging, due to the presence of brain atrophy. Therefore, instead of performing image registration to a standard template, such as the MNI atlas, all data sets were aligned to a population-specific atlas constructed from the data in this study. Transforming data sets from elderly and especially AD patients to a standard healthy brain such as MNI introduces registration errors that will affect the results (even when higher order viscous fluid model based registrations were used). In this context, the atlas itself is only used as a reference frame to which all data sets are registered. If it can be assumed that the registration itself of all the data to this atlas succeeds (which is an essential assumption in VBA, hence MNI was not used), similar results will be obtained, regardless the atlas used. In addition, to increase image registration accuracy, a high dimensional image registration algorithm based on the tensor information was used to align all data sets. However, partial volume effects between WM and gray matter cannot be completely excluded. After visual assessment of the image registration it was found that registration errors did not contribute to the observed findings.\nThe main differences in MK were found between AD and controls. Many brain regions showed significantly decreased MK in AD as compared to controls. Interestingly, only the splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiate were significantly different between MCI patients and controls. A recent study found extensive demyelination in the splenium and posterior corona radiate, measured by magnetization transfer imaging, in amnestic MCI patients. Moreover, the demyelination in the splenium and posterior corona radiate as well as in the superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with episodic memory performance 41.\nWith regard to the splenium of the corpus callosum specifically, our results are in line with earlier findings of atrophy of the splenium in AD, MCI, and subjective cognitive impairment 424344. The splenium size at baseline correlates with MMSE change after 1-year follow-up in AD patients 43. Furthermore, it was shown that annual tissue loss in the splenium is associated with progression to dementia. Subjects who progressed to dementia had more severe tissue loss in the splenium than subjects without progression at 3-year follow-up. This study, moreover, showed that more severe atrophy in the splenium was correlated with a lower MMSE score at 3-year follow-up 45. A recent DTI review 46 suggested that high-risk for AD among cognitively healthy individuals was associated with WM integrity decline in tracts connecting GM structures associated with memory function, including the splenium of the corpus callosum.\nWith regard to the corona radiate, decreased FA in the corona radiate correlates to cognitive decline in multiple sclerosis 47, probably due to the corona radiate containing fibers linking the capsula interna to cortical areas.\nConsistent with our results, earlier studies comparing MCI, AD, and controls also found decreased values of MK in MCI and AD 17,18. MK and radial kurtosis in the anterior corona radiate discriminated best between MCI and controls 18, which is in line with our results. Significantly decreased kurtosis parameters in the parietal and occipital lobes in AD as compared to MCI have been reported 17. In contrast, our study did not find kurtosis differences between AD and MCI. This difference might be due to the different diagnostic criteria used. While this study used the NIA-AA biomarker-based research criteria 19,20 for MCI and AD, Gong et al. 17 used clinical criteria for MCI. This heterogeneous MCI population will be more heterogeneous than the AD population. Moreover, both DKI studies 17,18 conducted manual ROI analysis, whereas VBA was used in this study.\nRegarding the DTI parameters, the differences in FA and MD were most pronounced between AD and controls. When comparing MCI to controls, only the splenium showed significantly decreased FA, while decreased FA was found in AD patients in many regions when compared to controls. Even more regions showed increased MD in AD patients compared to controls, while only the splenium was significantly different between MCI patients and controls. These results are partly consistent with earlier DTI studies reporting increased MD and decreased FA in MCIAD as compared to controls 48495051525354555657.\nOur results suggest that MD and MK are more sensitive compared to FA to detect differences between both MCIAD and controls. This is in line with a metaanalysis 5 and a recent study comparing regional DTI measures in AD, MCI, and controls showing that FA was least sensitive to detect group differences 58. In our study, MK seemed most sensitive to discriminate controls from MCI while MD was most sensitive to detect changes between MCI and AD. Additional studies including larger cohorts of subjects are needed to confirm these results. In addition, as DTI and DKI measures only provide an indirect characterization of microstructure, it would be interesting to apply biophysical models of the diffusion MRI signal to detect subtle microstructural changes of biological tissue more precisely. One such model is the WM model which relates DKI-derived metrics to WM microstructure 59. This model has been applied to AD, amnestic MCI, and controls 60,61 showing that WM tract integrity metrics are potential biomarkers for early AD and for disease progression.\nThis study has several limitations. First, only statistical results that were uncorrected for multiple comparisons were reported, as only very few voxels remained significantly different following correction for multiple comparisons. This can be explained by the relatively small population included and studies on larger groups are necessary to confirm these first findings. An additional limitation is inherent to VBA, such as the need for a perfect registration. However, by using a population-specific atlas of the subjects studied and a high dimensional registration algorithm based on tensor elements, we tried to ensure optimal image alignment. Finally, the number of patients is too limited to draw firm conclusions with regard to the use of DKI as a biomarker for MCI and AD. More and larger, prospective longitudinal studies are needed to further define the use of this potential biomarker and to investigate its benefit over other biomarkers.",

    "CONCLUSIONS": {
      "text": "Based on this explorative study, the results suggest that: 1) MD and MK are more sensitive than FA to discriminate MCI and AD from controls; 2) MK is most sensitive to discriminate MCI from controls; and 3) MD is most sensitive to discriminate MCI from AD.\nWe hypothesize that in WM structures and brain regions that are relevant for cognitive functioning, i.e., the splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiate, MK is most sensitive for detection of initial degeneration from the preclinical to MCI phase, and that further degeneration from MCI to AD is picked up by MD changes.\nIn conclusion, DTI and DKI parameter changes are suggestive of WM changes in AD. Independent and larger prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether these changes, and more specifically decreased kurtosis values in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the corona radiate could serve as a noninvasive MRI-based biomarker for early AD diagnosis.",

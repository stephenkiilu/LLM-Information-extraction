    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive MRI technique in the detection of white matter degeneration. We sought to demonstrate microstructural changes in normal controls, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) and to determine which DTI parameters could be a reliable tool for the early diagnosis of AD. In total, 90 participants (35 normal, 20 aMCI, 35 AD) were recruited. We included early AD patients with clinical dementia rating scores of 0.5 and 1. The fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values, DTI parameter, were measured with the regions of interest method in the bilateral hippocampal body and posterior cingulate. Clinical history, neurological examination, and neuropsychological assessments were conducted. The DTI parameters in the bilateral hippocampus and posterior cingulate in aMCI and AD were different from those in normal controls. No difference was found in DTI parameters of the posterior cingulate between aMCI and AD. However, hippocampal DTI parameters were different between aMCI and AD. Cognitive summary measures were significantly correlated with DTI parameters, especially FA values in the hippocampus. The DTI analysis technique demonstrated significant microstructural alterations in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate already in prodromal stage of AD. DTI parameters in the hippocampus may be a more sensitive method to determine microstructural changes in early AD states and more correlated with cognition than DTI parameters in the posterior cingulate.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique widely used in the detection of white matter (WM) degeneration 1. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a quantitative measure of tissue directionality, which can be reduced by changes in the tissue cytoarchitecture, most likely due to subtle small-vessel alterations, demyelination of axonal structures, and possibly gliosis 2. The mean diffusivity (MD), a quantitative measure of the mean motion of water, is increased by loss of neurons, axons, and dendrites 3. Most studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) have focused on gray matter degeneration because AD is known to be a disease of gray matter structures. However, DTI is now being investigated as an alternative tool for the early detection of AD because WM changes have been found in early AD or prodromal AD stages 4. These may be secondary to Wallerian degeneration and neuronal loss in cortical associative areas 5,6.\nAD shows an anterior-to-posterior gradient in pathological changes, and posteriorly located structures such as the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyrus are involved in the early stages 5. The hippocampus, a critical structure for learning and semantic memory formation, exhibits characteristic pathological features in AD, even during the very earliest stages of the disease or the prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 7. Diffusion changes in AD and MCI also tend to occur in posteriorly located regions 5. Decreased FA values and increased MD values in the hippocampus in AD or MCI have been reported in many studies 8910111213. The posterior cingulate is connected to the entorhinal cortex, which has reciprocal connections to the hippocampus and the memory system. It is associated with memory, attention, and decision making and has been reported to be affected in MCI patients converting to AD. The posterior cingulate showed degenerative findings in a few studies using DTI 14,15.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate changes in microstructural integrity of the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate in normal controls, MCI, and AD using DTI. We hypothesized that FA and MD values representing microstructural integrity might be significantly different between the groups. We also planned to determine which DTI parameters could be a better tool for the early diagnosis of AD.",

    "Subjects": {
      "text": "In total, 90 subjects were enrolled: 35 patients with AD who fulfilled the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD 16, 20 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) who fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria for MCI of Petersen et al. 17, and 35 normal controls recruited from St. Marys Hospital of the Catholic University of Korea from March 2009. Subjects were excluded if they were younger than 60 years of age or had a history of a disease that may cause cognitive disorder or major psychiatric disease.\nThirty-five healthy volunteers were enrolled as normal controls. They showed no cognitive impairment on the comprehensive neuropsychological test, their scores on the Korean version of mini-mental state examination (K-MMSE) 18 were above -1.0 standard deviations compared with age-and education-matched norms, and their clinical dementia rating scores were zero. They had no cognitive complaint and were assessed for the 28 illnesses proposed by Christensen et al. 19 that may be associated with cognitive impairment.\nAll subjects were assessed using physical and neurological examinations, neuropsychological tests including the Seoul neuropsychological screening battery as a formal comprehensive neuropsychological test 20, blood tests including a complete blood count, blood chemistry values, vitamin B12folate values, syphilis serology, and thyroid function tests. They also underwent brain MRI scans including trans-axial T2-weighted image, T1-weighted image, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and DTI. A neurologist examined the MRIs and excluded subjects with severe WM hyperintensities or multiple (more than 5) lacunar infarctions. Using axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, we rated the degree of WM hyperintensities visually. The longest diameter of WM hyperintensities around the periventricular area (capping and banding) and the deep WM area (separated from the periventricular area by the normal-looking WM) were evaluated separately. Periventricular WM hyperintensities longer than 10 mm and deep WM hyperintensities longer than 25 mm were considered to be severe WM hyperintensities.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St. Marys Hospital of the Catholic University. Written informed consent was obtained after providing a complete description of the study to the subjects and their caregivers.",

      "text": "We performed DTI using a 1.5-Tesla MRI (Signa Excite 11.0, GE Medical Systems) with a single-shot, spin echo, echo planar, diffusion-weighted sequence in addition to the full conventional MRI. A series of axial diffusion-weighted image with a diffusion sensitizing gradient (b value  1,000 smm 2 ) along 25 directions was obtained, as well as axial images without diffusion weighting (b value  0). Other diffusion parameters were as follows: TR  10,000 ms; TE  83.3 ms; matrix  128 mm 9 128 mm; field of view  260 mm 9 260 mm; number of excitations  1, 33 axial slices; and a slice thickness  4 mm with no inter-slice gap.\nThe raw DTI data (DICOM files) were processed with the programs Volume-One and dTVII (http:www.volume-one. org, http:www.utradiology.umin.jppeoplemasutanidTV. htm). The FA and MD values were measured using the regions of interest (ROI) method in the bilateral hippocampal body and posterior cingulate. The ROI was three dimensional-based voxels of interest with a size of 19 mm 3 and was drawn manually. Hippocampal ROIs were placed on a coronal-section image, which was reconstructed from the axial image. Anatomical landmarks according to Bernasconi et al. 21 were used for hippocampal ROIs. The ROI for the hippocampal body was placed on the upper lateral area of the hippocampus where the pons, third ventricle, and cerebral aqueduct were fully visible 8. The ROI for the posterior cingulate was placed on the bilateral cingulate above the corpus callosum where the pons and cerebral aqueduct were visible. ROIs of the posterior cingulate were also placed on coronal sections using landmarks according to Atmaca et al. 22 (Fig. 1) We coregistered the various DTI images (b0 image, diffusion-weighted image, FA map, apparent diffusion coefficient map, and color-coded map) of the subjects using the Add computational channels tool using the dTV.II program and found correct landmarks by comparing the various images in various planes.\nThe FA and MD values were obtained three times in random order to get the mean value to avoid misplacement of ROIs, which were all done by the same neurologist (LSC), who was blinded to the diagnosis. The intra-class correlation coefficients of each measurement varied from 0.763 to 0.927 for this rater. We calculated the ratio of FA and MD values; mean FA values were divided by mean MD values to simplify the DTI parameters.",

Comparison of age, formal educational level, K-MMSE score, clinical dementia ratingclinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scores, mean FA values, mean MD values, and MD FA values were made. v 2 tests were used for comparisons of gender distribution.

    "Results": {
      "text": "Basic demographic data and cognitive summary measures are listed in Table 1. There were no differences in age, gender, or education among the three groups. The clinical dementia rating and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scores were highest in AD (clinical dementia rating  0.89  0.370, clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes  5.25  2.569), followed by aMCI and normal controls (p  0.001), and the K-MMSE scores were the lowest in AD (19.3  4.49, p  0.001).\nThe mean FA and MD values did not differ between the left and right sides of the hippocampus (data not shown); thus, we calculated the mean FA and MD values from both sides of the hippocampus. The mean FA values in the bilateral hippocampal body and posterior cingulate in aMCI and AD were significantly lower than those in normal controls. The mean MD values in the bilateral hippocampal body and posterior cingulate in aMCI and AD were significantly higher than those in normal controls. No difference was found in mean FA or MD values between patients with aMCI and AD in posterior cingulate. Mean FA values were highest in normal subjects, followed by aMCI and AD, and mean MD values were lowest in normal, aMCI, and AD, in that order in hippocampal body (p  0.001, Table 2). The results were similar after correction of the differences of K-MMSE, clinical dementia rating and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scores (data not shown).\nAge and education were not correlated with the mean FA or MD values in this study. K-MMSE scores, clinical dementia rating, and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scores were significantly correlated with both mean FA and MD values. The correlation coefficient between the cognitive summary measures and mean FA values was higher than those between the cognitive summary measures and mean MD values. The highest correlation coefficient was between the clinical dementia rating score and mean FA values in the hippocampal body (r  -0.789, Table 3).\nMean FA and MD values were negatively correlated with each other. MDFA values in hippocampal body were significantly different among the three groups: highest in normal subjects and lowest in AD patients (p  0.001). MDFA values in the posterior cingulate were similar between the AD and aMCI groups, although MDFA values of AD and aMCI groups were significantly lower than those of the normal group in the posterior cingulate (Fig. 2).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The aim of our study was to assess DTI parameters in normal subjects, patients with aMCI, and those with AD to investigate the microstructural integrity of the hippocampus and posterior cingulate. We also evaluated the correlation of DTI parameters with cognitive summary measures. We found a significant FA decrease and MD increase in both the hippocampal body and posterior cingulate of patients with aMCI and AD. We also observed a high correlation between DTI parameters and cognitive summary measures, especially in the hippocampal body. Some previous studies found that DTI parameters of posteriorly located structures were changed significantly in MCI or AD, although the distribution and degree of microstructural changes vary 232425. The posterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus are areas that consistently show DTI changes, because they are among the key structures in the memory system and are involved early in AD. However, one study reported no significant difference in FA values, including in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, between ADMCI and normal controls 10, and another study reported that DTI parameters in MCI did not differ significantly from those of normal controls 13. These conflicting results might be due to different study subject populations, differences in imaging protocols, the various techniques used, and the ROIs identified for DTI analysis. Our results demonstrated significant microstructural degeneration in both DTI parameters, i.e., FA and MD values, in patients with aMCI and AD compared with those of normal controls. These were consistent with previous studies in which the DTI parameters of regions that are related to memory function were changed in AD and prodromal AD, i.e., MCI, when compared with those in normal controls 4,78910111213141526272829. These findings suggest that AD-associated tissue pathology may have developed in the white matter of hippocampal body and posterior cingulate in aMCI. Moreover, mean FA and MD values in hippocampal body showed significant differences between patients with aMCI and those with AD. These results indicate that microstructural alterations also developed in aMCI, but not as much as in the hippocampal body in AD. On the other hand, neither FA values nor MD values in the posterior cingulate showed differences between patients with aMCI and those with AD. This suggests that microstructural alterations developed in aMCI just as in AD in the posterior cingulate. These results might be due to early involvement in the MCI stage, but a lower pathological burden in the posterior cingulate, when compared with the hippocampus. Hippocampal DTI parameters might be more sensitive markers of AD-associated tissue pathology than are posterior cingulate DTI parameters.\nWe also assessed correlations between DTI parameters and cognitive summary measures and found that K-MMSE, clinical dementia rating, and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes scores were significantly correlated with DTI parameters. Age and education were not correlated with DTI parameters in our study. The degree of microstructural change (decrease in FA values and increase in MD values) in hippocampal body and posterior cingulate was associated with poorer cognitive summary measures. Moreover, DTI parameters in hippocampus were more highly correlated with cognitive summary measures than were those in the posterior cingulate, especially the FA values. These findings indicate that DTI parameters in the hippocampal body might be alternative sensitive markers to predict the level of cognitive function.\nWe also calculated the MDFA ratio to combine the various DTI parameters into one. The group differences in the mean FA and MD values were small, although they were statistically significant. On the other hand, the MD FA ratio might amplify the differences between groups. We can use a new parameter, MDFA ratio, in the future work using DTI to simplify and amplify the group differences.\nOur study has some limitations. This was a cross-sectional study, and the value of FA and MD in predicting progression from MCI to AD was not assessed. Second, evaluations of MRI findings such as WM hyperintensities and lacunar infarctions that may contribute to DTI parameters were not done in this study. Previous studies reported that local microvascular changes may contribute to WM alterations 13. We excluded subjects with severe WM hyperintensities and many lacunar infarctions to overcome this limitation. Finally, the DTI parameters in this study are not solely a measure of white matter degradation because the hippocampal body and posterior cingulate are mixed structures of gray matter and white matter. However, we showed markedly different FA and MD values between groups, indicating that a DTI study may be meaningful in mixed structures as well as in white matter structures.\nDespite these limitations, our study has some strengths. First, we used a manual ROI method and an experienced neurologist. The manual ROI method is a labor-intensive technique for DTI analysis; however, we were able to make a more precise delineation of tissue structure with a manual method, especially in small area such as hippocampus and posterior cingulate, and we reduced errors versus an automated DTI analysis 5. Moreover, we could overcome inter-rater variability using ROIs assessed by one experienced neurologist. On the other hand, automated DTI analytic techniques such as voxel based analysis and tractbased spatial statistics (TBSS) are less labor-intensive, hence can be used for whole brain analysis in larger sample size although they are not sensitive to small areas. If similar results can be shown also in automated DTI analysis, then we could use it widely for the early detection of AD-related pathology. Second, this is the first study to quantitatively compare DTI parameters in both the hippocampal body and posterior cingulate, both of which are important for memory processing. We found that the FA values in the hippocampal body were the marker most closely related to cognitive summary measures. Third, we evaluated whether these parameters were related to cognitive summary measures and showed a high correlation between WM degeneration and cognitive summary measures in early AD and aMCI. Finally, we found that MD and FA values were negatively correlated and calculated a new parameter, MDFA ratio. The MDFA ratio might simplify the DTI parameters and amplify the differences between groups and could be used as a new parameter in the future work.",

      "text": "The DTI analysis technique demonstrated significant microstructural alterations in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate in AD and aMCI patients. DTI parameters in the hippocampus may be a more sensitive method to determine microstructural changes in early AD states and more correlated with cognition than DTI parameters in the posterior cingulate. The diagnostic power of hippocampal FA and MDFA values for AD and aMCI in individual subjects needs to be determined for their possible future application as new diagnostic biomarkers.",

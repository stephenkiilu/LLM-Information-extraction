Methods The pReV-DeMaLs (predict to prevent Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis) study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. sixty-seven participants (38 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (c9) and 29 non-carriers (c9-)) were included in the present cross-sectional study. each participant underwent one single-shell, multishell diffusion MRI and threedimensional T1-weighted MRI. Volumetric measures, DTI and NODDI metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Differences in white matter integrity, grey matter volume and free water fraction between C9 and C9-individuals were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. results compared with C9-, C9 demonstrated white matter abnormalities in 10 tracts with neurite density index and only 5 tracts with DTI metrics. effect size was significantly higher for the neurite density index than for DTI metrics in two tracts. No tract had a significantly higher effect size for DTI than for NODDI. For grey matter cortical analysis, free water fraction was increased in 13 regions in C9, whereas 11 regions displayed volumetric atrophy. Conclusions NODDI provides higher sensitivity and greater tissue specificity compared with conventional DTI for identifying white matter abnormalities in the presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. Our results encourage the use of neurite density as a biomarker of the preclinical phase.

      "text": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are two degenerative diseases that share common genetic causes, the most frequent being a GGGGCC repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene. 1 2 Early stages of C9orf72 carriers have received much interest, because presymptomatic carriers represent the optimal target population for the development of new disease-modifying treatments against FTLD and ALS. Anatomical MRI-derived metrics, such as volumetry, have revealed brain atrophy in presymptomatic individuals who carry the C9orf72 mutation (C9). 3456789 Three studies 5 6 8 also detected disruptions of white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique, whereas another study failed to identify such abnormalities. 4 The DTI results are promising but with limitations. First, DTI metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), are non-specific biomarkers of microstructural architecture. 10 11 For instance, FA changes could be underpinned by combinations of neurite density reduction and orientation dispersion changes. 12 Besides, DTI is limited when an image voxel suffers from partial volume effect. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) was proposed to characterise alterations of microstructural integrity with higher tissue specificity. 12 NODDI derives a neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to quantify the density and angular variation of neurites, respectively. In addition, NODDI includes a free water fraction (FWF) parameter designed to capture the contamination of tissues by free water at the microstructural level.\nIn the present work, we assess the added value of NODDI compared with conventional DTI and anatomical MRI to detect changes at the presymptomatic phase of C9orf72 disease. We hypothesise that NDI and ODI offer higher sensitivity than FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) for detecting white matter abnormalities. Additionally, FWF is compared with volumetry and may provide complementary information for identifying grey matter changes.",

The NODDI model was then fitted to the artefact-corrected data, generating NDI, ODI and FWF maps using the NODDI Matlab toolbox (https:www. nitrc. org projects noddi_ toolbox).\nFor white matter analysis, DTI model was applied to the middle-shell data (b-value700 smm 2 ) to generate the FA map, in order to estimate the transformation field from the native diffusion space to the JHU space. Then NDI and ODI maps were registered into the JHU space using the transformation field obtained from the previous step. Finally, the regional mean values of NDI and ODI were calculated. For grey matter analysis, the normalised skull-stripped T1 image in FreeSurfer conformed space was rigidly registered onto the first b0 image of the artefact-corrected multishell DWIs. Then the inverse transformation field was applied to register FWF map in the FreeSurfer conformed space with a linear interpolation. For subcortical ROI analysis, a two-voxel morphological erosion operator was performed on each segmented subcortical ROI. 22 For cortical ROI analysis, FWF signal was projected onto cortical middle surface. The projected FWF value was calculated with a weighted average of signals from the seven intermediate surfaces, which were expanded at different fractions of cortical thickness (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65) from the white surface. Subsequently, the averaged middle surface was registered onto the FsAverage template in FreeSurfer conformed space using a surface-based registration method. 23 The aim of the erosion and middle surface projection approach was to avoid the partial volume effect (ie, elimination of free water contamination at the edges of ventricle and the borders of the brain parenchyma). Finally, the regional mean values of FWF were extracted for further cortical and subcortical analyses.",

      "text": "All statistical analyses were performed with R V.3.4.0 (The R Foundation). Structural and microstructural differences between C9 and C9-participants were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. We used real age, gender and group (ie, mutation status) as fixed effects and family membership as random effect measuring the difference between the average response in the family and in the whole population (online supplementary-appendix e-3). Likelihood ratio test was used to test each effect, and p values were corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method with a significance level of p0.05. Besides, the effect size of each ROI between C9 and C9-was also reported using Cohens f2. Effect sizes obtained for different models or metrics (eg, NODDI vs DTI) were compared using permutation tests with 10 000 iterations for significant ROIs. Effect size results confirmed that NDI was more sensitive than DTI metrics: among the 11 tracts in which significant differences were detected in either NDI or DTI metrics (MD, AD or RD), 7 tracts had higher effect size with NDI than with DTI metrics (figure 2). The effect size was significantly higher with NDI than with DTI for two of these tracts: left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p0.009) and right uncinate fasciculus (p0.008). None of the tracts had a significantly higher effect size with DTI than with NDI.

      "text": "The current study, for the first time, compared NODDI with conventional DTI and anatomical MRI in a large cohort of presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. There are three key findings. First, we demonstrate that NODDI provides higher sensitivity than DTI for detecting white matter microstructural changes. Second, the greater tissue specificity of NODDI suggests that the reduction of neurite density is a more likely cause of signal changes than the alterations of neurite orientation dispersion during the presymptomatic stage. Third, the pattern of FWF alterations slightly differs from that of grey matter volumetric atrophy, suggesting that both FWF and volumetry provide complementary information on the integrity of cortical and subcortical structures.\nWhen comparing the multishell DWI sequence with the standard single-shell DWI sequence, we hypothesised that NODDI could be more sensitive than conventional DTI for detecting white matter abnormalities during the presymptomatic stage. Previous works have shown that NODDI could be more sensitive than DTI for detecting white matter changes related to ageing 24 or young-onset Alzheimers disease. 25 Here, for the first time, we showed that NODDI outperformed DTI for identifying white matter abnormalities during the presymptomatic stage of a neurodegenerative disease. The spatial pattern of white matter changes is consistent with previous findings with conventional DTI. 5 6 8 Specifically, reduced NDI was mainly found in the corticospinal tract and frontal-temporal related tracts during the presymptomatic stage for C9orf72 carriers, which were preferentially involved in symptomatic mutation carriers who develop FTLD, ALS or both. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior study using NODDI in C9orf72 disease, neither at the presymptomatic nor at the symptomatic stage.\nThe interpretation of specificity for DTI metrics has been discussed, 26 27 suggesting that RD and AD reflect, respectively, demyelination and axonal damage and both provide more specific information than FA. However, these interpretations were also argued in the literature. 28 Compared with DTI, the more biophysically motivated NODDI model allows more direct analysis of independent microstructural effects: the loss of neurite density and the alteration of neurite orientation dispersion. This potential for greater tissue specificity has motivated application of NODDI in a few neurodegenerative disease studies. 25 29-32 In young-onset Alzheimers disease, one study showed widespread NDI reduction and regional ODI reduction in the corpus callosum and internal capsule of patients. 25 In Parkinsons disease, another study observed reduced NDI in the substantia nigra and putamen of patients. 31 In the present study, we detected widespread NDI decrease in the white matter, but no alteration of ODI (figure 1). This suggests that the reduction of neurite density, not the alterations of neurite orientation dispersion, is the predominant pathological process in white matter during the presymptomatic stage of C9orf72 carriers. Interestingly, similar reduction of neurite density within corticospinal tract has been found in patients with ALS. 33 Our observation suggests that the neurite loss is the main pathological process, but this needs further histological confirmation. We note however that Grussu et al 32 have demonstrated, in the tissue specimen of multiple sclerosis, that ODI correlated well with histological measures of neurite orientation dispersion, and NDI with histological measures of neurite density.\nMapping the free water in tissues is important in order to estimate the variations in extracellular volume (related to FWF) due to pathological processes. 34 FWF has been applied in several neurodegenerative diseases. Using a bitensor model, FWF has been demonstrated as an imaging biomarker of progression of Parkinsons disease in the posterior substantia nigra. 35 36 Interestingly, a chronic treatment effect of rasagiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B as a medical monotherapy, has been verified with FWF in the basal ganglia in Parkinsons disease. 37 These findings support the use of FWF as a promising biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases to evaluate the free water-related alterations. In the present study, FWF detected free water alterations mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes. This finding is consistent with previous studies using volumetric measure. 3456789 The unique differences detected with FWF in the left insula and left lateral occipital lobe were also reported in literatures using volumetric measure. 3-5 7 These suggest that macroscopic brain atrophy may accompany free water alterations inside the cortex. Surprisingly, FWF failed to show changes in subcortical structures, such as the thalamic atrophy where a significant effect of C9orf72 mutation was evidenced by volumetry. These Neurodegeneration findings suggest that distinct degenerative processes could occur in cortical and subcortical structures at the same time during the presymptomatic stage.\nReliability of an imaging technique is an important issue for its use in clinical trials. We do not have test-retest scans in our participants. However, the reliability of NODDI has been assessed in previous studies. 38 39 NODDI metrics were shown to have excellent reproducibility with coefficients of variation below 5 in all measured ROIs and even below 3 in the vast majority of regions. 39 Furthermore, the reproducibility of NODDI metrics was shown to be comparable with that of conventional DTI. 38 This, together with its higher sensitivity to detect white matter alterations, supports the use of NODDI in clinical trials.",

    "limitations": {
      "text": "Our study has the following limitations. First, the cross-model comparison between NODDI and DTI used two different DWI acquisitions, which were performed within 1 week sequentially for each participant. However, the single-shell and multishell DWI sequences were optimised for DTI and NODDI model, respectively. Thus, this systematic comparison helps clarify the added value of a longer but clinically feasible multishell diffusion sequence. Second, caution should be exercised in diffusion MRI-based cortical analysis. NODDI, by construction, accounts for partial volume effects from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contamination, thus minimising the influence of atrophy on the NODDI metrics. Moreover, a recent paper 40 has explicitly looked at the influence of cortical thickness on NODDI metrics, showing that the majority of changes in NODDI metrics persisted following adjustment for cortical thickness. Nevertheless, the cortex is a thin structure compared with the resolution of diffusion MRI, and partial volume effect may impact on the computation of regional FWF measures. Although we implemented specific image processing procedures to mitigate partial volume effects, it is still possible that some partial volume effect remains, impacting on FWF estimates.",

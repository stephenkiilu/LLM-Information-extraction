    "abstract": "Brain white matter fiber bundles in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) have abnormalities not usually seen in unaffected subjects. Ideal algorithm of the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity might reveal the changes of tissue properties varying along each tract, while previous studies only detected the mean DTI parameters of each fiber. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these abnormalities of nerve fiber tracts are localized to specific regions of the tracts or spread throughout and to analyze which of the examined fiber tracts are involved in the early stages of Alzheimers disease. In this study, we utilized VBA, TBSS as well as AFQ together to comprehensively investigate the white matter fiber impairment on 25 CE patients, 29 MCI patients and 34 normal control (NC) subjects. Two tract profiles, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were extracted to evaluate the white matter integrity at 100 locations along each of 20 fiber tracts and then we validated the results with 27 CE patients, 21 MCI patients and 22 NC from the ADNI cohort. Also, we compare the AFQ with VBA and TBSS in our cohort. In comparison with NC, AD patients showed widespread FA reduction in 25 (5 20) and MD increase in 65(1320) of the examined fiber tracts. The MCI patients showed a regional FA reduction in 5 (120) of the examined fiber tracts (right cingulum cingulate) and MD increase in 5(120) of the examined fiber tracts (left arcuate fasciculus). Among these changed tracts, only the right cingulum cingulate showed widespread disruption of myelin orand fiber axons in MCI and aggravated deterioration in AD, findings supported by FAMD changes both by the mean and FA changes by point wise methods and TBSS. And the AFQ findings from ADNI cohort showed some similarity with our cohort, especially in the pointwise comparison of MD profiles between AD vs NC. Furthermore, the pattern of white matter abnormalities was different across neuronal fiber tracts; for example, the MCI and AD patients showed similar FA reduction in the middle part of the right cingulum cingulate, and the anterior part were not damaged. However, the left arcuate fasciculus showed MD elevation located at the temporal part of the fibers in the MCI patients and expanding to the temporal and middle part of the fibers in AD patients. So, the AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, and may provide new insights into white matter degeneration in MCI and its association with AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) and its prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are typical neurodegenerative disorders and the most common forms of dementia in older adults (Ferri et al., 2006). A growing number of studies suggest that white matter microstructure differs in patients with AD and MCI compared to healthy controls; therefore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has received increasing attention because it can detect microstructural integrity of white matter fiber bundles (Amlien and Fjell, 2014). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are two frequently used quantitative measures of DTI that detect the anisotropy and overall displacement of water molecule diffusion (Le Bihan, 2003). Although most researchers suggest that white matter abnormalities exist in AD and MCI, whether the patterns of white matter abnormalities are different across neuronal fiber tracts remains unknown.\nSeveral approaches for DTI analyses, such as region of interest (ROI) analysis, voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) have been applied in AD and MCI studies. For example, Alves reported decreased FA and increased MD in selected brain regions or certain segments of fibers in patients with AD and MCI (Alves et al., 2015). However, this ROI based DTI analysis is hypothesis-dependent, and most of the brain area remains unexamined, making localization difficult. Several other previous studies used VBA and indicated a significant FA reduction in the fornix, the splenium, and several other regions (Medina et al., 2006;Nir et al., 2013;Struyfs et al., 2015), whereas VBA is not sufficiently precise at the individual level because of the variants in the shape of long-range fiber tracts among subjects (Wassermann et al., 2011;Yeatman et al., 2011). To improve the specificity of the detection of white matter lesions, tract-based voxel grouping analysis, such as TBSS, has been employed to reveal deterioration in the limbic fibers, the fronto-occipital fasciculi, the inferior longitudinal fasciculi and other (Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Honea et al., 2009;Stricker et al., 2009;Zarei et al., 2009;Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2010;Liu et al., 2011;Bosch et al., 2012). But, there was only modest agreement between TBSS-based tract definitions and the actual location of a tract in an individuals brain (Tsang and Wandell, 2010), and voxel-based technique cannot provide the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity along each tract.\nIn summary, these white matter analysis techniques have merits and demerits respectively, and an ideal algorithm of the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity along each tract may be needed to enrich the white matter studies. In vivo, tissue properties may vary along each tract for the following reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Therefore, the diffusion measures along each fiber tract (tract profiles) of whole brain need to be further investigated (Hattori et al., 2011). Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ) is a new algorithm that automatically identifies white matter tracts in human brains and takes measurements at anatomically equivalent locations along their trajectories (Beaulieu et al., 2012). In this study we performed AFQ to extract FA and MD at 100 locations along 20 fiber tracts to evaluate tract profiles of the white matter integrity across AD and MCI compared with normal controls (NC). These 20 tracts include association tracts, projection tracts, commissural tracts between cortices and fibers in the limbic system. Therefore, in the current study we utilized VBA, TBSS as well as AFQ together to comprehensively investigate the white matter fiber impairment in the MCI and AD patients. We hypothesize that the abnormalities of the fiber tracts are limited to specific regions of tracts in MCI and spread throughout the tracts in AD. Furthermore, certain fibers are involved in the early stages of AD, and white matter impairment spread along fiber tracts in different patterns across all the examined fibers. We hope that as a novel algorithm, the AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, and may provide new insights into white matter degeneration in MCI and its association with AD.",

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, China. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.\nEach subject underwent a whole brain MRI scan, a general medical examination, and a neuropsychological assessment with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) score, all performed by neurologists blinded to the results of MR imaging results.\nAD was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD (Rabe-Jablonska and Bienkiewicz, 1994). Twenty-five patients met these criteria. Twenty-nine consecutive patients met the criteria of Petersen et al. (Petersen, 2004) for MCI. Thirty-four subjects (NCs) were identified as individuals who (a) had no cognitive complaints, (b) had a normal level of clinical rating scales, and (c) had no evidence of any abnormality determined by conventional MRI.\nThe exclusion criteria were set as follows: 1) concurrent illnesses (such as diabetes mellitus, addictions or psychiatric diseases other than AD) or treatments interfering with cognitive function; 2) a score higher than 4 on the Hachinski Ischemic Scale; 3) the presence of structural abnormalities that could cause cognitive impairment, or the presence of leukoaraiosis higher than Fazekas grade I, which were identified by conventional MRI; 4)  8 years of education; or 5) not right-handed.\nAt the same time, to validate the findings, we employed 70 patients (27 CE patients, 21 MCI patients and 22 NC) from ADNI with age and gender matched with our cohort.\nPart of data used in the preparation of this article was obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni. loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimers disease (AD).",

The pre-processed DTI images and 3DT 1 weighted images were fed into the AFQ software (Yeatman et al., 2012), which is a MATLAB toolbox and is used to identify and quantify 20 white matter tracts in each subjects brain. The technique details and parameters were exactly same to those described in the original AFQ paper (Yeatman et al., 2012), except that the cingulum was divided into cingulum cingulate and cingulum hippocampus in the new versions. The identification and quantification procedure steps can be summarized as 4 steps: (1) performance of whole-brain tractography for each subject. All fibers are tracked within a white matter mask using deterministic tractography;\n(2) segmentation of a whole brain fiber group into fascicles using an automated ROI approach. The ROIs are defined based on a previous study, and the fiber tracts are subsequently refined by comparing each fiber within the fascicle to a probabilistic fiber tract atlas (JHU whitematter tractography atlas); (3) definition of the core of the tract and filtering out of stray fibers that deviate from the core of a fiber group by representing a fiber group as a 3D Gaussian distribution before removing the fibers from the fiber group center; (4) calculation of the diffusion measurements along the trajectory of the fiber group weighing each fibers contribution to the measurement based on its distance from the tract core. The diffusion measurement along the fiber tract core, which is a vector of 100 values, was defined as the tract profile. In this way, the tract profiles of FA and MD at 100 points along each of the 20 tracts were evaluated for each subject to depict their global white matter status.\nThe 20 identified tracts included: bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), corticospinal tract (CST), cingulum cingulate (CCing), cingulum hippocampus (CHippo), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), uncinated fasciculus (UF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), splenium, and genu of the corpus callosum (CC) (Wakana et al., 2007).",

Continuous variables were compared between the three groups using one-way ANOVA, and then the false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed in the mean FA and MD comparisons. Then pairwise comparisons among groups were conducted when necessary with the least significance difference (LSD) test.\nFor the VBA, the ANOVA was used to compare the FA and MD values in a voxel-.\nbased manner with SPM and the p level was  0.05. For the TBSS, a nonparametric statistical thresholding with permutation-based inference tool (FSLs randomize) was used to compare the FA and MD among three group and the p level set at p  .05, corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold-free cluster enhancement.\nFor the pointwise comparisons, FA and MD at 100 locations along the 20 fiber tracts were fed into a permutation-based statistical analysis with 1000 permutations. For each permutation, all the subjects were redivided into the three groups randomly, while keeping the sample sizes for each group, then the ANOVA and the post hoc test statistics were recalculated for each location of each fiber. After that, for each fiber, the maximum length of the continuous significant locations (for each location, significant means this location have a larger t or F statistic that corresponds to a p  .05) for each test was recorded, thus allowing the construction of the permutation distribution of the maximum length of significant locations; those locations with length within the top 5 of such distribution were considered significant at the 0.05 level (thus, familywise error rate corrected) (Nichols and Holmes, 2002).\nFor the comparison among the VBA, TBSS and AFQ, we calculated the percentage of significant voxelspoints over the total number of evaluated voxelspoints in VBA, TBSS and AFQ. Significant white matter voxels were calculated in the comparisons among groups in VBA, and tract-based voxels are calculated in TBSS.

In comparison with NC, AD patients showed widespread FA reduction in 25 (520) examined fiber tracts and MD increase in 65 (1320) examined fiber tracts. While MCI subjects showed regional FA reduction in 5 (120) examined fiber tracts (right cingulum cingulate) and MD increase in 5 (120) of examined fiber tracts (left arcuate fasciculus). Then we validated the findings with ADNI cohort, which showed significantly similar changes in the pointwise comparison of MD in AD compared to NC. In the mean FA and MD comparisons, there were no FA or MD differences reach statistical differences in MCI and NC, which was also similar finding in AD and MCI. In contrast, in the VBA analysis, widespread FA reduction and MD increase were found in AD, when compared to NC. But there was not any difference in the AD and MCI or NC and MCI. In the TBSS analysis, no significant difference was found for FA among all the three groups, while widespread MD increasing was found in AD when compared to NC, which was similar to the VBA results. In summary, using the point wise method of AFQ, we have found the location specific white matter abnormalities, which could not be achieved with the mean FA and MD analyses. Therefore, AFQ is an important supplement in the white matter studies.\nIn our results of VBA analysis, almost all the white matter voxels showed difference of FA and MD in AD, compared to normal controls, but there is no significant difference between MCI and NC or AD and MCI. Therefore, VBA seems to be very sensitive to those larger differences, like AD vs. NC but have low spatial specificity. When the difference is milder (like MCI and NC or AD and MCI), it showed no",

This all-or-none result may because low spatial precisely of the fibers when using morphology based normalization. For TBSS, we also see an all-or-none result. MD elevation in inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and many other fibers in AD, compared to normal controls, but no significant results were found between AD and MCI or MCI and NC. None results was found for FA. As a tract-based voxel grouping analysis technique, TBSS partially overcome the problem of each voxel not totally on the same fiber after registration in VBA. But the inconsistent shape of fiber tract across participants may lead to error registration, such as the corpus callosum and so on. Jin et al. reported that Tractspecific analysis (TSA) can reveal detailed local alterations in each tract, which provide a 3D detailed profile that reflects local alterations in a particular tract associated with AD or MCI (Jin et al., 2017). Meanwhile the AFQ showed more specific locations in fibers of MD difference in AD and NC, while it is sensitive to detect some mild alteration between MCI and NC or AD and MCI, which indicate that it has advantages, and could be a complementary method to the classic ones.\nNeurobiological systematical variation along each tract has been considered as the potential result of different patterns of white matter abnormalities across neuronal fiber tracts. Using AFQ, we found that most of the examined fiber tracts showed widespread white matter abnormalities in AD, while in MCI, only a few of the fiber tracts showed FA and MD alterations, whose findings were similar in the ADNI cohort. Moreover, among these changed tracts, only the right cingulum cingulate and the left arcuate fasciculus displayed obvious disruption of myelin andor fiber axons in MCI and aggravated deterioration in AD. This finding was supported by FAMD changes through both the mean, the TBSS and point wise method. We also found the location of white matter abnormalities to be different across 20 examined neuronal fiber tracts; for example, the MCI and AD patients showed similar FA reduction in the middle part of the right cingulum cingulate, whereas the anterior part were reserved. However, the left arcuate fasciculus showed MD elevation located at temporal part of the fibers in MCI and expanded to the temporal and middle part of the fibers in AD.\nIn the limbic system, the fMRI studies have suggested that hypometabolism or hypo-perfusion initially occur in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (Nestor et al., 2003a;Nestor et al., 2003b). We found the middle part or the middle component of the right cingulum cingulate showed FA reduction in both MCI and AD patients with AFQ analyses. Previous studies found hypo-metabolism of the middle cingulate gyrus in AD using 18F-FDG PET (Villain et al., 2008) and showed an Aβ load in the right posterior cingulate using 11 C-PIB EPT (Furst and Lal, 2011), which were partially consistent with our results. Among association fiber tracts, the uncinated fasciculus is associated with episodic memory, the formation and retrieval of memory and cognition (Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992). Previous studies have reported that FA values in the uncinated fasciculus are significantly lower and MD values are significantly higher in patients with AD than in healthy controls (Taoka et al., 2006;Yasmin et al., 2008). In this study, we noted supportive results with TBSS and AFQ, and the ADNI cohort showed same findings with AFQ. Multiple AD-risk studies have reported reduced white matter integrity in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (Persson et al., 2006;Gold et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2010). One study revealed that the Aβ42p-Tau181 ratio was positively correlated with FA in the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, suggesting this tract is involved in AD pathology (Molinuevo et al., 2014). An MD increase more than an FA reduction in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus indicates that the deterioration from the MCI to AD might be primarily caused by the myelin degradation progress. We also found that even in AD, FA reduction and MD elevate was not significant in terms of mean diffusion measures in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, whereas using AFQ we found the left part of splenium of corpus callosum and the right part of genu of corpus callosum showed significant FA reduction. The ADNI cohort also showed similar pointwise changes of FA reduction in the corpus callosum. A previous study showed that Aβ deposition was correlated with reduced FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum but not in the entire corpus callosum (Chao et al., 2013). Interestingly, we also found that there were no differences among AD, MCI or NC subjects in terms of the mean FA and MD, but there were some abnormal locations in the tract profiles using AFQ.\nThe above abnormality of white matter bundles indicated the pathological process of AD. The pathology of neurofibrillary tangles shows a significantly correlation with cognitive impairment in AD, which develops first in the trans entorhinal cortex and then may spread to the entorhinal cortex in stages I and II, adjacent to the hippocampus, which is part of the limbic system in stages III and IV, followed by the medial temporal isocortex (isocortical, stages VVI), and finally into the brain (Mufson et al., 2015). We found that in MCI, FA reduction occurs primarily in the right cingulum cingulate, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation and uncinated fasciculus, and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. At the AD stage, these pathological changes occur in additional fibers, including the bilateral corticospinal tract, left cingulum cingulate, and left cingulum hippocampus, which is consistent with previous reports of the Aβ progression pathway.\nAlthough we found more abnormalities of myelin orand fiber axons in the 20 examined fiber tracts by pointwise tract profiles among the groups than mean diffusion measures, and prove AFQ is an important supplement of VBA and TBSS, there are a few limitations in this study. First, given that the AD patients are at a late disease stage, it is possible that gray matter atrophy in these patients may have a technical influence on the tractographic results, and therefore such atrophy may contribute to the observed abnormality of the tract profile. Second, DTI measurement could be associated with the prominent white matter hyper-intense lesions found in these patients. The current data are limited in their ability to distinguish these two issues. Third, because of the threshold setting in the fiber tracking, some fibers like bilateral cingulum hippocampus tracts are adjacent to the gray matter and the FA in this part were low, this may lead to fail track some fibers. Forth, the AD diagnosis was not based on biomarkers but only on the neuropsychological scales, which was subjected by our research conditions and might cause imprecise diagnosis.\nIn conclusion, AFQ can automatically reconstruct white matter tracts in human brains and detect at equivalent locations along these fasciculi, which can be a complementary method for VBA and TBSS technique. We used this method in AD, MCI patients and NC subjects, and examined two diffusion parameters (FA and MD) at 100 locations along 20 white matter fiber tracts. Our results indicated that AFQ can detect changes in specific location along fibers, and the pattern of the disrupted location was different among the fibers, but in most, the disruption started from a certain region in MCI before, expanding to include entire fibers in AD, whose findings were validated by the ADNI cohort. These results may enrich the study on neurodevelopmental alterations and the progression of AD, which can provide new insights into the determination of white matter in the progression from MCI to AD with AFQ.\nFig. 8. The percentage of the significant FA reduction region of VBA, TBSS and AFQ, respectively, among AD, MCI, and NC groups. 0 means there were no differences of FA in the comparison between AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI with TBSS. The y-axis is the percentage of significant voxelspoints over the total number of evaluated voxelspoints in VBA, TBSS and AFQ.",

We tested the hypothesis that higher financial literacy is associated with higher diffusion anisotropy in white matter, adjusting for the effects of age, education, sex, and white matter hyperintense lesions.

      "text": "Financial literacy is the ability to understand, access, and utilize information regarding monetary concepts and institutions in ways that contribute to better financial outcomes (Braunstein and Welch, 2002;Hilgert et al., 2003). Financial literacy has been linked with enhanced mental health in young adults (Taylor et al., 2009) and with optimal retirement outcomes and better financial planning in older adults (Lusardi and Mitchel, 2007a;Lusardi and Mitchel, 2007b). Because of this, financial literacy could have a significant impact not only upon the independence and wellbeing of older adults, but also families, caregivers, and society, as older adults make many important decisions about retirement savings and intergenerational transfers of wealth. For these reasons, a greater understanding of financial literacy is of critical importance, and examination of the neural correlates of financial literacy could inform interventions that may result in the maintenance or improvement of decision making in old age.\nThe acquiring of financial literacy can hypothetically be viewed as involving the coordination of two subprocesses in the brain: (1) the development of learned contextual knowledge (in this case financial knowledge), mediated through a network of posterior cortical (temporal-parietal) brain regions implicated in the Default Network (Buckner et al., 2008); and (2) the utilization and manipulation of that knowledge, primarily mediated through a network of anterior cortical (frontal) brain regions (Decety and Michalska, 2010;Hurliman et al., 2005). Those who develop greater financial literacy may have greater integration within or between these networks and the brain regions in them. We previously demonstrated that financial literacy was associated with greater functional connectivity between brain grey matter regions in these networks after adjusting for important covariates including level of cognition (Han et al., 2014). Since functional connectivity measures can be dependent on the structural integrity of white matter connections that facilitate communication between functionally associated brain grey matter regions (Koch et al., 2002;Griecius et al., 2009), the acquiring of financial literacy might also have an impact upon indices of white matter integrity in the brain. Further supporting this notion, increases in acquired general literacy have been observed to result in increasing white matter density and anatomical connectivity between brain grey matter regions in adulthood (Carrieras et al., 2009;Thiebaut de Shotten et al., 2014).\nWe tested the hypothesis that financial literacy is associated with greater white matter integrity in regression models that adjusted for the effects of age, education, sex, and white matter hyperintensities. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated this in 346 non-demented older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinicopathologic study of aging. We additionally examined whether results remained significant after further adjusting for cognitive function. To our knowledge, this is the first study of financial literacy associations with white matter integrity in a large communitybased sample of non-demented older adults.",

      "text": "Participants of the current study were recruited from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging and dementia (Bennett et al., 2012b). The Rush Memory and Aging Project recruits participants from residential facilities and community organizations local to the Chicago metropolitan area, including senior housing facilities and retirement homes. Annual clinical evaluations are conducted with all participants. Standard criteria were used in the diagnoses of dementia (McKhann et al., 1984) and determined by a clinician with expertise in aging as previously reported (Bennett et al., 2012b).\nThe Rush Memory and Aging Project began in 1997, and enrollment is ongoing. A decision making sub-study which had the financial literacy assessment was added in 2008. Neuroimaging was introduced in 2009. At the time of these analyses, 1,684 participants had completed the baseline of the parent project and 893 of these participants were enrolled in the decision making sub-study. Of these 893 participants, 791 were enrolled in the MRI component of the parent study, 420 had MRI scans and 401 had DTI scans at the time of these analyses, but 3 failed quality control, leaving 398 with usable DTI data. Of these 398 participants, 5 had dementia and 47 had missing data, leaving a total of 346 subjects with complete data on financial literacy and DTI.",

      "text": "Financial literacy was measured with 23 questions based on numeracy, concepts, and information as described in previous work (James et al., 2012;Bennett et al., 2012a;Boyle et al., 2013;Han et al., 2014). Questions included items adapted from materials in the Health and Retirement Survey (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a;Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007b) and include inquiries of monetary calculations such as sales and interest rates, as well as knowledge of financial concepts such as bonds, stocks, and FDIC. An example of an item is Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account is 1 per year and inflation is 2 per year. After 1 year, will you be able to buy more than, exactly the same as, or less than today with the money in your account? Another example is True or false. Using money in a bank account to pay off credit card debt is usually wise. The percent correct was calculated for each participant and used in accordance with previous studies (Boyle et al., 2013;James et al., 2012;Bennett et al, 2012a;Han et al., 2014).",

    "Imaging Approach": {
      "text": "Brain MR imaging was conducted on all participants using a 1.5 Tesla General Electric MRI scanner (Waukesha, WI). On average, participants underwent neuroimaging within approximately two months of completing the clinical evaluation and financial literacy assessment (mean  60 days; standard deviation  51 days). High resolution T1-weighted anatomical data was obtained using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradientecho (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: echo-time (TE)  2.8 msec, repetition time (TR)  6.3 msec, preparation time  1000 msec, flip-angle  8, field-ofview (FOV)  24 cm  24 cm, 160 sagittal slices, slice thickness  1 mm, no gap, 224  192 acquisition matrix reconstructed to 256  256, and two repetitions, for a total imaging time of 22 minutes. T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) data was collected on all participants using a 2D fast spin-echo sequence with the following parameters: TE  120 msec, TR  8 sec, inversion time  2 sec, FOV  24 cm  24 cm, 42 axial slices, slice thickness  3 mm, no gap, 256  224 acquisition matrix reconstructed to 256  256, and a scan time of 4 minutes and 1 second. Finally, spin-echo echo-planar DTI data was collected on all participants using the following parameters: TE  84.6 msec, TR  5.4 sec, FOV  24 cm  24 cm, 36 axial slices, slice thickness  3 mm, no gap, 128  128 acquisition matrix reconstructed to 256  256, b  900 secmm 2 for 12 diffusion directions uniformly distributed in 3D space (Hassan et al., 2001), two b  0 secmm 2 volumes. The DTI data acquisition was repeated 6 times for a total of 72 diffusion-weighted and 12 b  0 smm 2 image volumes. The total DTI scan time was 7 minutes and 33 seconds.\nFor each participant, white matter lesions commonly present in the brain of older adults (often referred to as white matter hyperintensities, WMHs, due to their hyperintense appearance in T2-weighted images) were automatically segmented using a support vector machine classifier based on both MPRAGE and FLAIR information (WMLS, SBIA, University of Pennsylvania, PA) (Zacharacki et al., 2008), and a mask (0s and 1s) was generated (voxels with WMH were given values of 1 in the mask). The same projection parameters were used to project the WMH mask values from the same voxels as the local FA maxima. Thus, each voxel on the white matter skeleton had a corresponding WMH mask value of either 0 or 1. These values were used as covariates in our models. All DTI analyses controlled for WMHs since these may impact calculation of diffusion anisotropy. For the DTI data, corrections for bulk motion and distortions caused by eddy-currents and magnetic field non-uniformities, B-matrix reorientation, and diffusion tensor calculation were conducted using TORTOISE (www.tortoisedti.org) (Pierpaoli et al, 2010). Maps of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace of the diffusion tensor were produced (Le Bihan et al. 2001;Basser and Pierpaoli, 2001). The WMH mask of each participant was transformed to the space of the corresponding processed DTI data based on the transformation of the FLAIR image volume to the pre-processed b  0 secmm 2 volume. A detailed description of the image processing steps can be found in Arfanakis et al. 2013.",

    "Statistical Analyses": {
      "text": "The Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) approach was used to investigate the association of financial literacy with white matter diffusion measures (Smith et al., 2006). The FA volumes from all participants were non-linearly spatially transformed to the mean FA template of the IIT Human Brain Atlas (v.4.0) (www.iit.edumri) (Varentsova et al., 2014). The local FA maxima from each participants spatially transformed FA volume were then projected onto the white matter skeleton of the IIT Human Brain Atlas (v.3.2). The same projection parameters were used to project the trace and WMH mask values from the same voxels as the local FA maxima. Linear regression was then used to test the association of FA along the white matter skeleton (outcome) with financial literacy (predictor), controlling for age, sex, level of education, and presence of WMHs voxel-wise. Analyses were then repeated further adjusting for cognitive function. Separate linear regression models were used to test the association of the trace of the diffusion tensor along the white matter skeleton with financial literacy, controlling for the same factors mentioned above. The trace of the diffusion tensor refers to the sum of the diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor. This was also considered since it has been associated with pathological indicators of white matter, such as edema or stroke (Mukherjee et al., 2009). The null distribution was built using the randomise tool in FSL (FMRIB, University of Oxford, UK) and 5000 permutations of the data. Differences were considered significant at p0.05, Family Wise Error (FWE) corrected. The Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method was used to define clusters with significant effects (Smith and Nichols, 2009). The regionstat tool of the IIT Human Brain Atlas (v.4.0) was used to extract the list of most probable connections passing through clusters showing significant effects, according to the information contained in the 4-dimensional, connectivity-based white matter labels of the IIT Human Brain Atlas (v.4.0) (developed using high angular resolution diffusion imaging probabilistic tractography) (Varentsova et al., 2015).",

    "Association of Financial Literacy with White Matter Integrity": {
      "text": "TBSS analysis demonstrated significant positive correlations between the measure of financial literacy and FA values in a number of white matter regions and the thalamus, controlling for age, sex, level of education, and WMHs (p0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Association tracts were highly represented among results, in particular tracts connecting temporal and parietal brain regions (Figure 1, Table 2, Supplementary Materials 1a-c).\nNext, analyses for FA were repeated further adjusting for cognitive function in addition to age, education, sex, and WMHs. Results revealed many of the same white matter pathways remained significant (Figure 2, Table 3, Supplementary Materials 1d-g). However, significant results were observed only in the right hemisphere and implicated mostly pathways in superior temporal and parietal regions. Again, association tracts were highly represented among results. TBSS analyses did not show any significant association between financial literacy and the trace of the diffusion tensor, adjusting for the effects of age, education, sex, WMHs, and cognitive function. Since older adult females tend to show lower rates of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011;Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008), we conducted analyses to determine whether there was a sex by financial literacy interaction on DTI measures. Formal analyses revealed no notable sex interactions.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We investigated the association of financial literacy with white matter integrity in the present study. Financial literacy was associated with diffusion anisotropy, an indicator of white matter integrity, in a number of brain pathways in models that adjusted for demographic factors and white matter hyperintensities. The main pathways implicated were association tracts connecting temporal and parietal regions. Furthermore, the association of financial literacy with a number of white matter pathways remained significant in the right hemisphere after further adjusting for cognitive function. These results are congruent with the observation of greater functional connectivity between brain grey matter regions previously reported, as we observed greater financial literacy associated with greater functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and regions of the middle temporal, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus of the right hemisphere in prior work in participants from the same cohort (Han et al., 2014). Altogether, these results suggest a link between financial literacy and white matter integrity that is relatively independent of cognitive functioning.\nAtlas-based analyses (Varentsova et al., 2015) revealed that most of the white matter pathways implicated were association tracts connecting temporal and parietal regions, and adjusting for cognitive function mostly implicated temporal-parietal pathways in the right hemisphere. Although the significance of this is yet unclear, we previously demonstrated that better responses to a temporal discounting paradigm were associated with functional connectivity of right temporal lobe regions (Han et al., 2013), and susceptibility to scams was associated with lower grey matter density in right temporal lobe regions (Han et al., 2015) in older adults in participants from the same cohort. The present study further supports the potential importance of right temporal lobe regions and their connections to other brain areas in the processing of financial matters. We speculate that these temporal lobe regions serve an important role in retaining and accessing prior-learned contextual knowledge (Peters and Buchel, 2010;Peters and Buchel, 2012). The significance of rightsided laterality is consistent with the right hemi-aging hypothesis (see Dolcos et al., 2002), which posits age-related pathological declines affect functions attributed to the right hemisphere earlier or to a greater degree than the left hemisphere. However, more research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying these associations.\nIt is interesting to note that we observed significant associations between financial literacy and fractional anisotropy in cerebellar connections; however, these were not significant after accounting for cognitive functioning. The cerebellums role in cognitive functioning has garnered significant attention in the neuroimaging literature within recent years (Buckner, 2013;Stoodley, 2012;Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009a;Keren-Happuch et al., 2012). Significant portions of the cerebellum map onto higher order cortical association areas, basal ganglia, thalamic, and brainstem structures (Bostan et al., 2013;Buckner et al., 2011), and congruent with this understanding, functional neuroimaging literature has demonstrated activation in the cerebellum associated with complex cognitive functions such as working memory, executive functions, and language (Kim et al., 1994;Petersen et al., 1989;Koziel et al., 2013;Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009b). We have demonstrated cognitive functions are associated with financial literacy in old age (Bennett et al., 2012), therefore our findings of cerebellar circuitry associated with financial literacy in the present study are consistent with this and other literature implicating the cerebellums role in higher order functions.\nNo other study to our knowledge has investigated associations of financial literacy with white matter integrity in older adults. Our results suggest three possible interpretations of the relationship between financial literacy and white matter integrity. The first possibility is that financial literacy may help to maintain or improve white matter integrity in the brains of older adults, and this link is not fully explained or accounted for by cognitive function. Previous studies have demonstrated that an increase in literacy in adulthood is associated with greater white matter integrity; for example, one study followed Columbian former guerillas of adult age as they re-integrated into society and learned how to read. After their literacy improved, white matter tracts between brain regions were found to be stronger when compared to carefully matched adult illiterates (Carrieras et al., 2009). Another study that investigated illiterates, persons who acquired literacy in adulthood, and persons who acquired literacy as children, found that literacy was associated with multiple stronger white matter pathways even when only considering the first two groups (Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2014). These studies suggest that literacy enhancement may help refine the organization of white matter even in adulthood. A second possibility is that participants with greater white matter integrity throughout their lives may have been more predisposed to acquiring literacy in financial matters across the lifespan. A third possibility is that financial literacy and white matter integrity are both associated with another confounding factor that drives change in both, independent of cognitive functioning. While all three of these interpretations are plausible, more work is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying these three possible interpretations.\nThere are some limitations of the present study. One limitation is that we were not able to compare our results to a younger sample to determine whether our results reflect agespecific effects. Future studies are necessary to replicate these results in samples with more male and younger adult participants. Another limitation was that we conducted this diffusion tensor imaging study in the same cohort as our previous functional connectivity study. Since these techniques measure associated brain characteristics, conducting this study on a separate cohort may offer more complementary evidence of a link between white matter integrity and financial literacy. An important limitation to note is our inability to make direct causal inferences based on these cross-sectional observational data. A longitudinal model showing an increase in financial literacy resulting in a later increase in white matter integrity would be provide stronger evidence for a causal link. A potential limitation may be our approach to correcting for WMHs. Since we were interested in localization of white matter tissues implicated by financial literacy, we believe our voxel-level consideration of WMHs is more appropriate than an overall volume that yields no spatial specificity. However, posthoc analysis of the relationship between financial literacy and overall volume of WMHs was significant in our sample (r-0.2569, p0.001), and if volume of WMHs is used instead of voxel-level WMH information, the association between financial literacy and white matter integrity becomes non-significant in our models (after correction for multiple comparisons). The underlying mechanisms for this are unclear and more work is needed to demonstrate whether there is a possible link between financial literacy and volume of WMHs. Another potential limitation is our use of the TBSS approach to investigate white matter integrity. This approach has been recently suspected of having potential limitations and biases (Bach et al., 2014), and in particular, the skeleton projection step may reduce accuracy of results (Schwarz et al., 2014). If true, these limitations may affect generalizability of our results. A final limitation is that we do not know the exact underlying mechanisms for the associations that we observed. FA is dependent on microstructural tissue properties such as myelination, degree of axonal diameter, axonal density, interaxonal spacing, and intravoxel coherence of axonal orientation (Sen and Basser, 2005). Future histological studies of brain white matter as a function of financial literacy in humans may provide further mechanistic insights into these results.\nThe present study had multiple strengths, including participants from a community-based sample, a large sample size, and the control of multiple characteristics -such as age, education, sex, white matter hyperintensities, and global cognition -that may be associated with financial literacy and white matter integrity. Our results suggest financial literacy is associated with greater white matter integrity beyond the effects of cognitive functioning. Future work is necessary to establish the temporal direction of this relationship with longitudinal models, and if it is found that financial literacy results in greater white matter integrity in old age, then additional work is needed to determine whether targeted interventions may have an effect on this association. The development of interventions to improve financial literacy could have the effect of increasing white matter integrity in the brain, which may facilitate greater reserve against age-related brain pathology and poor financial decision making in old age. Supporting this view, our group has noted the beneficial effects of financial literacy on decision making is stronger in persons with lower cognitive functioning, suggesting that efforts to improve financial literacy may enhance decision making in these persons (James et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first neuroimaging study of white matter integrity associations with financial literacy in old age.

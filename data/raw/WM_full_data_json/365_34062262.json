    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) paradigms, using non-invasive approaches, can provide relevant findings about brain aging. The attention has been primarily focused on neurodegenerative diseases, while little or nothing has been done to differentiate physiology from pathology. The present study aimed to test diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) metrics to analyze physiological age-related changes in rats at myelin structure and activation level; findings were validated by ex vivo histology. The purpose is to find comparable biomarkers in rodents and humans to allow a reliable translation from pre-clinical to clinical settings. Data evidenced: i) a significantly higher cerebrospinal fluid volume in middle-aged and aged vs. young rats; ii) a progressive alteration of white matter; iii) a significant reduction of evoked activity in aged animals. These results partially mirror the age-related changes in humans and may represent a preliminary step to find reliable tools for a lifelong monitoring with a value for the clinical practice (e.g., to provide support to the early diagnosis of dementia in asymptomatic subjects).",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The worldwide increase of life expectancy commits to new efforts to improve the well-being of the elderly population (https:www.who. intnews-roomfact-sheetsdetailageing-and-health).\nTherefore, studies devoted to investigating and, accordingly, counteracting the mechanisms involved in the aging process per se as well as in age-related diseases are becoming increasingly urgent.\nBrain aging represents a key issue since it implies cognitive decline and behavioral changes that can range from benign senescence forgetfulness to mild cognitive impairment to dementia (Kelley and Minagar, 2009;Heinik, 2010); it can considerably worsen the life quality of the elderly individuals and decrease their daily independency, thus creating a significant burden to caregivers and Health Systems. Human-based studies on brain aging need non-invasive approaches, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are extremely useful allowing to correlate structural and functional changes in vivo (Damoiseaux, 2017;Rigters et al., 2017). Commonly used methods are based on volumetric evaluation through T 1 and T 2 weighted imaging at high resolution, but while these approaches focus on the visible level of tissue morphology, more sophisticated techniques are available to study cerebral aging, such as diffusion tensor and functional imaging (diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI)). DTI is highly sensitive to fibers integrity, organization and composition (Meoded and Huisman, 2019) so that cerebral water diffusion anisotropy may represent a marker of early tissue degeneration, regardless overall macroscopic brain structure. Notwithstanding DTI capability to investigate structural changes, its sensitivity does not directly highlight neuronal activity. On the contrary, fMRI detects the functional activation of brain areas due to specific stimuli by the acquisition of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) tissue signal variation (Koopmans and Yacoub, 2019).\nWhile multi-approach MRI analyses reached a wide consensus to support diagnosis, progression monitoring and therapies response of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Raman et al., 2016;Mak et al., 2017;Strafella et al., 2018;Chen and Kantarci, 2020;Young et al., 2020), less has been achieved to differentiate physiology and early, often asymptomatic, pathology (Li et al., 2013;Rohrer et al., 2015;Ye et al., 2017;Cheng et al., 2018;Jack et al., 2019) that, paradoxically, might represent the real breakthrough. Similar shortcomings involve animals, with attention primarily focused on age-related diseases (Sahara et al., 2014;Holland et al., 2015;Wayman et al., 2016;Kolosova et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2020), and few or nothing on physiological aging (Cowley et al., 2012;Koo et al., 2012;Zhao et al., 2016).\nThe present study investigated the physiological brain aging process applying structural (diffusion and volumetric) and functional MRI tools to a wild-type rat strain, validating the findings by ex vivo histology. The purpose is to compare animals and humans aging to find possible, common changes that could support the preclinical reliability of MRI techniques. Indeed, animal models allow easily collecting several data from the same individual, to apply dependable post-mortem analyses, and to control the interfering variables that often bias the human cohorts (e.g., genetic variability, lifestyle influence, non-perfect overlap between chronological and biological age, drugs use). Therefore, they can represent a valuable tool to test new approaches for the early diagnosis of neurodegeneration rather than preventive pharmacologicalnonpharmacological protocols.\nWe did choose i) to evaluate gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes because of the widely reported structural brain alterations during aging in humans, ii) to evaluate DTI metrics because of the numerous described age-related changes in white and gray matters in humans (Raz and Rodrigue, 2006;Galluzzi et al., 2008;Liu et al., 2017;Wilson et al., 2019;Chabriat and Jouvent, 2020;Rieck et al., 2020), and iii) fMRI because of nearly all the component of the neural-vascular coupling is affected in the elderly (Hillman, 2014;Abdelkarim et al., 2019).",

      "text": "In vivo acquisitions were performed on a Biospec Tomograph operating at 4.7 T, equipped with an electronic control system console (AVANCE II) and a self-shielded gradient insert with the capability of a maximum 40 Gcm gradient intensity (BGA9, Bruker, Germany). A double coil configuration was used, based on a 7.2 cm bird cage volume coil as radio frequencies (RF) transmitter and a four-channel phased array surface coil, optimized for rat head, as RF receiver. Animals were pre-anesthetized with 5 isoflurane (Isoflurane-Vet, Merial, France) in a mixture of 50 N 2 50 O 2 , with a flow of 1.5 lmin, less than 1 min into an acrylic induction chamber for scanner placing. After positioning in the scanner, gaseous anesthetic, administered via a facemask (Fluovac, Harvard Apparatus) connected to a coaxial circuit, was reduced and maintained at 2.5. The animals head was immobilized by a bite bar and ear sticks. Respiratory rate and body temperature were monitored using a PC-SAM Small Animal Monitor (SA Instruments, NY, USA); body temperature was maintained at 37-38  C through a heated animal bed with a warm water circuit embedded in the animal holder (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). After a scout image, acquired to ensure correct head positioning in the magnet isocenter, magnetic field inhomogeneity was corrected with the shimming Bruker protocol. Imaging protocols were set as follows: for the morphological T 2 weighted (T2w) scans (RARE sequence), TR (repetition time)  6712 ms, TE (echo time)  76 ms, FOV (field of view)  3.5  3.5 cm 2 , matrix size  128  128, 22 slices of 1 mm thickness; for DTI (EPI sequence), TR  3800 ms, TE  39.5 ms, 8 shots, FOV  40  30 mm 2 , matrix size  256  192, NEX (number of excitation)  2 and 30 non-collinear diffusion directions with b  1000 smm 2 , 15 slices of 1 mm thickness; echo navigators were selected in order to reduce motion artifacts.",

      "text": "In healthy older humans, activation becomes progressively weaker and more widespread (Minati et al., 2007). To clarify whether this trend has a correspondence in rats, fMRI experiments were performed in the middle-aged and aged groups. One week after T2w and DTI scans, animals were examined by fMRI in accordance with Tambalo and colleagues (Tambalo et al., 2015). Briefly, animals were pre-anesthetized as in Section 2.1. In order to minimize gaseous anesthesia interference in cerebral blood volume and increase BOLD signal during the acquisition, isoflurane at 2.5 in 70 N 2 30 O 2 mixture was slowly reduced until reached 0 before fMRI experiment. Sedation was maintained with a subcutaneous dose of medetomidine (Domitor, Orion Corporation, Finland) at 0.1 ml100 g of body weighth by an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Massachusetts, USA) until the end of the fMRI protocol. Respiratory rate and body temperature were monitored using a PC-SAM Small Animal Monitor (SA Instruments, NY, USA); body temperature was maintained at 37-38  C through a heated animal bed with a warm water circuit embedded in the animal holder (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), and breathing rate per min was kept at 50  10. Blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) was monitored using a TCM4 Transcutaneous Blood Gas Analyzer (Radiometer, Denmark); pCO 2 remained within the physiological range during the entire procedure (34-40 mmHg). To increase sensitivity (i.e., the contrastnoise ratio between activated and non-activated pixels), a superparamagnetic iron oxide blood pool contrast agent (Endorem, Guerbet) was administered through the tail vein at a dosage of 3.75 μlg of body weight.\nFunctional response was elicited by the right forepaw stimulation trough two subcutaneous electrodes inserted between digits 1-2 and 3-4 (S88 GRASS instruments, West Warwick, RI, USA). Forepaw stimulations in anesthetized animals is a robust method to investigate neurovascular activity (Devonshire et al., 2012) in an anesthetic independent way (Schroeter et al., 2014). A square pulse of 2 mA was applied at the frequency of 3 Hz and repeated 6 times. An ONOFF block scheme was adopted: the pulse was switched for 20 s ON and 60 s OFF, for a total of 8 min, then followed by a recovery time of 15 min. The overall protocol was applied 3 times for each animal during the fMRI acquisition, for a total scan time of 54 min. Functional imaging protocol consisted in a gradient echo planar multi shot sequence, which parameters were set as follows: TR  520 ms, TE  5.9 ms, FOV  55.4  40.0 mm 2 , matrix size  128  64, 5 slices of 2 mm thickness, with a spatial resolution of 0.433  0.625 mm 2 . TE was chosen equal to the value of T2 in rat brain after contrast agent injection (Van Camp et al., 2006). Physiological parameters (i.e., body temperature, respiration rate, and pCO 2 ) remained stable during the entire stimulation period. Images were acquired pointing the starting slice from the rhinal sulcus, thus allowing the complete Somatosensory Cortex coverage. At the end of fMRI experiments, medetomidine was antagonized by intraperitoneal injection of 5 mgml atipamezole (Antisedan, Pfizer) at a volume ratio to medetomidine of 4:1.",

Rats were deeply anesthetized with 3 mlmin of O 2 containing 5 isoflurane before reaching the anesthetic depth for surgery accordingly to Gage et al. (Gage et al., 2012). Animals were intracardially perfused by 4 paraformaldehyde in saline solution after blood washout by phosphate buffered (PB) saline. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in PB for 4 h and processed by embedding in paraffin using standard methods. Samples were cut in 6 μm thickness coronal sections using a rotative microtome (Leica Biosystem). Serial slices for overall brain coverage were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for anatomical evaluations and with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) counterstained with Cresyl Violet (CV) for evaluation of myelin fibers and Nissl bodies. Absence or presence of oedema was assessed from a morphological point of view in accordance to standard criteria (Yates et al., 1975;Garman, 2011). Ventricles expansion was measured on 12 serial slices stained with HE obtained from 3 rats per group (i.e., young, middle-aged, and aged) by means of ImageJ software (http:rsb.info.nih.govij).",

To compute gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, brain was segmented from the T2w images and registered to a rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2013) following the procedure described in Schwarz et al. (Schwarz et al., 2006). Aligned images were preprocessed through FMRIBs Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) as in Zhang and colleagues (Zhang et al., 2001); volumes were quantified for each tissue type and expressed in cm 3 . The cerebellar volume was also investigated by manual segmentation of the T2w images.\nIn vivo DTI images were reconstructed with ParaVision 5.1 (Bruker, Germany) and analyzed to evaluate fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Diffusion metrics were calculated in whole brain by a semiautomated method (Tambalo et al., 2015) and in Corpus Callosum and Somatosensory Cortex by manually drawing ROIs (regions of interests). Corpus Callosum and Somatosensory Cortex were chosen because of mainly composed by WM and GM, respectively.\nFunctional MR images were processed with FSL using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and dual regression tools (Smith et al., 2004). The raw time series were computed into MELODIC to identify the activation components (Beckmann and Smith, 2004). The stimulus paradigm, convolved with the hemodynamic response function, was considered as an explanatory variable in the general linear model pipeline. After the identification of the activated area as one of the components revealed with ICA, dual regression analysis was performed to detect group differences in shapeamplitude of the activated area (Nickerson et al., 2017).",

The statistical significance of the regression model was assessed by means of F-statistics and the R 2 value was calculated as well. FA and ADC parameters were measured by the ROIs method in Corpus Callosum and Somatosensory Cortex; values were reported as mean  SEM and compared among the groups by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. To assess alterations in the functional response, group-ICA differences were tested by means of non-parametric permutation test as implemented in FSL (Nickerson et al., 2017). To account for multiple comparisons and identify significant differences the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement method (Smith et al., 2009) was set in FSL randomise command. Multiple comparisons-corrected statistical maps were thresholded at p  0.05 to identify significant clusters.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Among the age-related changes that affect the human brain, the most consistent are certainly i) atrophy (i.e., several regions undergo volume loss due to neurons structural and functional deficits) and enlargement of ventricles-hydrocephalus ex vacuo-, ii) vascular alterations (e.g., vessel narrowing as well as stiffening and thickening of vessel walls), iii) thinning of WM associated with myelin sheaths breakdown and oligodendrocytes alterations, and iv) impairment of activation so that, to maintain certain performances, greater and more widespread activation is needed (Cohen et al., 2019).\nOur multi-level MRI approach demonstrated that aged, healthy rats go through similar changes than humans. Indeed, a significant gain of CSF volume was confirmed, while structural T2w MRI revealed no differences throughout aging of GM and whole brain volumes, that, however, does not exclude the presence of atrophy in specific areas. Indeed, Hamezah and colleagues found an age-related volumetric reduction in several regions (e.g., Hippocampus and Striatum) but not in the whole brain (Hamezah et al., 2017). Besides, the increased chromatolysis evidenced in the primary Somatosensory Cortex as well as the reduced cellular presence highlighted in the Corpus Callosum by HE and LFB-CV staining strengthened the presence of neural alterations. The loss of anisotropy and the increase of mean diffusivity in WM revealed fibers deficits, despite the histological analysis showed no evident differences comparing young, middle-aged, and aged rats. This inconsistency could be due to the multiple impairments assessable by DTI-from density to dimension to myelinization degree-that maybe coexist without reaching a level detectable by the LFB-CV staining; after all, most evidence stresses no myelin loss in rats, even if no absolute agreement exists in literature (Juraska and Lowry, 2011). The topic certainly needs further investigations, especially in view of the RD values that could indicate an early myelin impairment not visible with the traditional ex vivo approaches. The lower fMRI activity in the Somatosensory Cortex evoked by stimulation is in agreement with previously reported results (Tambalo et al., 2015), and mirrors the general decreased activity found in humans both in resting state and under stimulation, and due to the impairment of the coordinated neural-vascular coupling (Agbangla et al., 2017;Ishii et al., 2018;Abdelkarim et al., 2019). Interestingly the decreased fMRI response in old vs middle-aged group is paralleled by an alteration in DTI parameters (reduction in FA and increase in ADC values measured in the Somatosensory Cortex). Nonetheless, healthy elderly people have also areas of hyper-activation (Li et al., 2015) not found in aged rats. It is plausible to hypothesize that while humans have developed strategies to preserve as long as possible their daily efficiency exploiting alternative pathways to counteract the progressive agerelated changes, rats do not have this kind of resilience because of, in the wild, aged animals are rare and useless for the herd. Interestingly, in middle-aged and aged rats ADC, AD, and RD values had a significantly higher intra-group variability than in young animals. This finding is in line with the heterogeneity-both structural and functional (Raz and Rodrigue, 2006;AR et al., 2011;Eyler et al., 2011)-of the senescent brain and may be a key point to discriminate among individuals with different aging trajectories.\nIn healthy elderly, cognition is characterized by losses (e.g., working memory and process speed), but also by preservation or even gains (e.g., semantic memory and verbal fluency) (Mather and Carstensen, 2005;Swirsky and Spaniol, 2019). A completely different picture describes patients affected from age-related neurodegenerative pathologies (e.g., Alzheimers disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease), who experience severe decline in cognition and behavior (Iadecola et al., 2019;Fang et al., 2020;Verny and Duyckaerts, 2020). To date, no effective therapies exist for dementia, especially for AD that accounts for 50-56 of all dementia cases (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010). One of the issues is the tardive diagnosis: when the symptoms became evident, the cerebral alterations are serious and non-reversible. Thus, reliable, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnostic tools that allow to early identify the shift from physiology to pathology are crucial to develop effective therapeutic treatments. The validation of such tools in animals takes advantage of suitable ex vivo testing and of robust clinical homogeneity. Indeed, in humans, the enrolled cohorts could overlap patients at different stages of the same pathology-often excluding asymptomatic subjects-as a consequence of the influence of the cognitive reserve on the symptoms severity; moreover, incorrect type of dementia could be diagnosed and the elderly affected by MCI, who are the target group for an early diagnosis, are, by definition, such heterogeneous that new biomarkersimaging techniquesclinical scales are continuously under evaluation to ameliorate the subclassification. Thus, our findings represent a first step to define the physiological similarities between the rat and the human brain aging. This might prepare the bases for the detailed research of even minimum clues of pathology onset by noninvasive approaches that can be easily applied as screening campaign for at risk subjects (e.g., with familiarity or homozygosis for the ε4 allele of APOE).\nOur study has some limitations. As brain sexual dimorphisms exists regarding morphology, functionality, gene expression and behavioral traits (Cahill, 2006;Merz et al., 2017), our results need to be replicated in female animals. The same is true for the use of different strains, which can significantly differ in key characteristics that influence the cerebral aging (see for instance Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore, longitudinal protocols associated to cognitivebehavioral tasks would help to better clarify the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of the so-called age-associated memory impairment (Kaup et al., 2011) (i.e., why agematched subjects can exhibit a broad range of performances and aged unimpaired individuals can perform comparably to, or even better than younger ones (Dixon et al., 2014;Gallagher et al., 2006)).",

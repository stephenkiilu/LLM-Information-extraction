      "text": "Clinical and experimental studies support that vascular dysfunction not only worsens, but plays a mechanistic role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) 1234. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are highly prevalent in individuals 75 years of age or older 1,5. VCID is accompanied by impairment in cognitive and executive function of presumed cerebral microvascular origin, which comprises a spectrum of subcortical small vessel disease that contributes to progressive injury of the periventricular and frontal white matter (WM) 678910. In addition to the abnormalities in the cerebral cortex, such as neuron loss and decreased synaptic density, clinical observations also suggest that alterations in the cerebral WM contribute to the development of cognitive dysfunction and memory deficits in AD 5,11,12. Notably, a large proportion of AD patients exhibit co-morbid cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemias) that are known to impair cerebral microvascular function. Cerebral small vessel disease is a common manifestation of aging and other cardiovascular disorders that cause cerebral hemodynamic disturbances, leading to reduced cerebral WM perfusion and subsequent axonal damage 1234. Myelination deficits can manifest as WM lesions or WM hyperintensities, detected by neuroimaging 8,131415161718192021. Apparent differences in WM hyperintensities in elderly patients with AD coincide with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-measured fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities as an independent determinant of axonal loss 22. Furthermore, individuals with AD pathology may not develop dementia without underlying vascular dysfunction. Human autopsy findings suggest that over 50 of clinical AD patients have histopathology-or MRI-defined vascular brain injury 23,24. Presently unresolved is the extent to which cerebrovascular dysfunction is associated with changes in WM integrity that affect cognitive and memory functioning in AD patients.\nConsistent with the contribution of cerebral microvascular dysfunction to human WM injury, we previously described selective vasodilator dysfunction of WM penetrating arterioles, which appears to contribute to remyelination failure in chronic WM lesions in brain donors with no pathologically described macroscopic infarcts or hemorrhages and with low levels of AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) 24. Earlier, we also identified significant oxidative damage to myelin and axons in WM, which, independent of the burden of ADNC, coincided with DTI-defined WM lesions 25. While strong associations between oxidative stress and WM injury in chronic hypertension and diabetes support a microvascular etiology in both VCID and AD 1,26, the role of microvascular dysfunction in the development of WM injury from co-morbid pathologies of VCID and AD remains undefined. Here, we hypothesized that vasodilator dysfunction of WM-penetrating arterioles is closely linked with quantitative MRIDTI-defined WM integrity and astrogliosis, especially in patients exhibiting both microvascular brain injury (mVBI) and high ADNC. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed prefrontal WM of deceased older participants in a population-based cohort focused on understanding the epidemiology and biological underpinnings of brain aging and dementia. In contrast to pial arterioles, we found that a selectively impaired, bradykinin-induced vasodilation occurs in WM-penetrating arterioles from brain donors with comorbid ADNC and microvascular brain injury. Abnormal vasodilator responses of WM penetrating arterioles were associated with pathological confirmation of WM injury and MRIdefined WM microstructural integrity changes.",

      "text": "All tissues were derived from brains donated for research by participants in the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, an ongoing population-based study of aging and incident dementia among men and women in Seattle, WA. For vascular reactivity studies, between 2013 and 2016, we prospectively collected 28 human WM samples at the level of prefrontal cortex (PFC) from rapid research brain collections and protocols customized for this study in the University of Washington Bio Repository and Integrated Neuropathology Laboratory. Superior frontal gyrus and subcortical white matter from one randomly determined hemisphere from donors with short post-mortem interval were rapidly dissected, immersed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), and shipped to Augusta University for vascular reactivity studies and analyses, as previously described 24. Adjacent prefrontal subcortical and deep white matter were dissected rapidly, flash frozen in liquid N 2 or fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde (followed 48 h later by transfer to PBS), and shipped to Oregon Health Sciences University for molecular and stereological analyses. Post-mortem intervals were  8.3 h to tissue collection and preservation. After the rapid procedures, the intact hemibrain, and remaining non-sampled dissected hemisphere, were fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin (NBF), followed by systematic tissue sectioning, sampling, and extensive histological and immunohistochemical workup according to the NIA-AA (National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association) guidelines for the assessment of ADNC 27,28, which includes assessment of microvascular brain injury (mVBI), as defined by the number of cerebral microinfarcts in standard screening Sections 293031.\nWe excluded other commonly comorbid pathological changes in the aging brain, including Lewy body disease and gross infarcts or chronic hemorrhages. Inclusion criteria for vascular reactivity studies took into consideration the impact of vascular and parenchymal amyloid and employed the NIA-AA criteria and scoring for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) by evaluation of amyloid (A)β immunohistochemistry in leptomeningeal and parenchymal vessels. In addition to overall ADNC, we focused specifically on Braak stage of neurofibrillary degeneration as used in our past studies. For both cohorts, cases with cortical, WM, basal ganglia, or thalamic microinfarcts were assigned to the mVBI group (Table 1).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study was conducted in prospectively and consecutively collected samples from a communitybased cohort followed until death with brain aging and incident dementia. We report that a selectively impaired vasodilation to the endothelium-dependent agonist bradykinin occurs in WM-penetrating arterioles in cases with high ADNC and comorbid mVBI (cases with cerebral microinfarcts). The impaired vasodilator response of WM arterioles in AD and mVBI is associated with WM injury, as confirmed by astrogliosis and DTI-measured changes in WM We previously reported that mVBI is accompanied by oxidative stress and quantitative MRI-defined abnormalities in prefrontal WM that involve disrupted integrity of axons and myelin 25. In a subsequent study, we found that human mVBI involves an Fig. 4 WM arteriole dysfunction is accompanied by significant elevations in astrocyte density in AD  mVBI (D) vs. control (A), mVBI (B), and AD only (C) groups as illustrated with representative photomicrographs of GFAP-labeled astrocytes (A-D) and shown quantitatively in E (P  0.05; P  0.01; NS  nonsignificant). F Bradykininmediated vasodilation of WM arterioles plotted vs. astrocyte density, as a marker of the burden of WMI. Scale bar, 100 µm unexpected imbalance in vascular reactivity between pial and WM microvessels, and that impaired vasodilator function of WM-penetrating arterioles was associated with WM lesions in which oligodendrocyte progenitors failed to terminally differentiate to myelinating oligodendrocyte in astrocyte-enriched lesions 24.\nRecent evidence suggests that individuals with high ADNC (Aβ deposition and pathologic tau) may not develop dementia without underlying cerebrovascular dysfunction 37, which may not only worsen but also play a mechanistic role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia in patients with AD. While strong associations between cerebral small vessel disease and WM injury suggest such a mechanistic link, the contributions of cerebral vascular dysfunction and human AD remain poorly defined. It has been long recognized that many AD patients exhibit co-morbid cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus that are well-known contributors to cerebral microvascular endothelial dysfunction 1234. In these pathological conditions, disrupted cerebral perfusion may arise even before the development of substantial neuronal and axonal damage and cognitive dysfunction. On the other hand, studies also have shown a significantly reduced cerebral blood volume in young (4-month-old) transgenic mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice, indicating that very early disturbances in the microvasculature occur in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in this AD mouse model 38. Interestingly, aged mice overexpressing mutant or even non-mutant forms of tau also develop both morphological and functional pathological changes in cerebral cortex blood vessels 39. Collectively, emerging experimental evidence suggests that early changes in cerebral microvascular function occur and may be mechanistically linked to ADNC.\nIn this study, we determined the function of WMpenetrating arterioles in donors exhibiting both microvascular brain injury (mVBI) and low or high ADNC and defined the relationship between vascular dysfunction, astrogliosis, and quantitative MRI-measured WM microstructural integrity. Most human cerebrovascular functional reactivity studies examined only larger caliber vessels such as the middle cerebral 40,41 and pial arteries 42. In the present study, pial arterioles had no apparent defects in vascular reactivity, but WM arterioles displayed an impaired Fig. 5 Bradykinin-induced vasodilation of WM arterioles for the entire cohort of cases plotted vs. MRI-defined frontal white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; A) and fractional anisotropy (FA; B). C, D Bradykinin-mediated vasodilation of WM arterioles is plotted for the low AD vs. high AD cases, which illustrates the loss of vasomotor response in the high AD group in contrast to low AD, which is significantly associated with bradykinin response for both ADC (C) and FA (D) dilation to the endothelium-dependent agonist, bradykinin in cases with mVBI, and high ADNC. Since pial arterioles regulate downstream changes in local WM flow 1, our results suggest that additional compromise of arteriolar blood flow involves dysregulation of blood flow at the level of penetrating WM arterioles, especially with WM injury from both mVBI and high ADNC. Moreover, impaired endothelial function of WM arterioles may also limit the retrograde, upstream propagation of vasodilator signaling, thereby preventing both local and pial surface artery-dependent control of cerebral blood flow in ADNC, as previously suggested 43,44. Cerebrovascular endothelial cells are integral part of the neurovascular unit. Through a dynamic communication with cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, astrocytes, and neurons, endothelial cells critically contribute to the moment-to-moment regulation of cerebral blood flow 45. In addition, hemodynamic forces acting through vascular endothelial cells, such as wall shear stress, can also modify glial and neuronal functioning to maintain cerebral homeostasis 45. It has been long known that ischemic WM lesions often occur in watershed areas supplied by WM penetrating arteries 46. Under pathological conditions, subcortical WM is considered even more vulnerable to reduced perfusion and less capable of tolerating fluctuations of cerebral blood flow and cerebral venous pressure 47. It is therefore plausible that cerebrovascular endothelial cell dysfunction occurring selectively in WM-penetrating arterioles not only exaggerates but also contributes to the development of WM injury in AD patients.\nThe mechanisms of impaired vasodilation of WM penetrating arterioles that contribute WM injury remain poorly defined but appear to be exacerbated by the combination of ADNC and mVBI. Notably, transgenic mice overexpressing APP display pronounced disturbances in cerebral autoregulation 48. Endothelial synthesis of the vasodilator NO by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is central to dilation of cerebral arteries 49 and plays key roles in cerebrovascular regulation related to cognitive impairment 50. We previously found a significant elevation in WM oxidative stress in mVBI, independent of the burden of AD, but associated with WM lesions 25. APP transgenic mice with elevated soluble Aβ levels display markedly reduced cerebrovascular responses to vasodilatory stimuli 48,5152535455.\nIn endothelium-specific APP-deficient (eAPP - -) mice, NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation was reduced, which was accompanied by reduced eNOS expression and cGMP levels 56. Notable, endothelial dysfunction was found to be preserved in transgenic mice expressing both mutant pathogenic APP and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), supporting a role for excess production of reactive oxygen species in mutant APP transgene mice. In this context, it has been shown that in cerebral microvessels of transgenic mice expressing the Swedish double mutation of human APP (Tg2576 mice) leads to eNOS uncoupling, which is a potential source of superoxide anion production 57. NAD(P)H oxidases (Nox1-4) are another source of reactive oxygen species that can directly interfere with NO-mediated vasodilation, and thus contribute to the development of cerebrovascular dysfunction in transgenic mice that overexpress abnormal APP 58,59. Here, we report a trend for a reduced expression of eNOS in WM-penetrating arterioles, when compared to pial vessels and also in WM arterioles in human cases with ADNC and mVBI. Moreover, Nox1 expression showed a trend towards increased expression only in WM arterioles in ADNC and mVBI, when compared to other groups of cases. These findings suggest a role for augmented oxidative stress-related impairment of WM-penetrating arteriole function, which may be attributed to a synergistic interaction between mVBI and ADNC, but to demonstrate causation additional mechanistic studies with a larger cohort are required to further explore this possibility.\nWe also examined whether changes in WM microvascular vasomotor function correlate with neuroimaging parameters of cerebral WM microstructural integrity. Although MRI-defined WM hyperintensities are commonly detected in periventricular as well as frontal WM, the pathological features for these lesions remain poorly defined 60,61. Studies have begun to determine the spectrum of MRI-defined hyperintensities and other quantitative MRI indices of WM injury in AD patients. A prior study by Gouw et al. found considerable heterogeneity in WM hyperintensities in elderly patients with AD and observed that DTI-measured FA was the only independent determinant of axonal loss 22. We previously analyzed frontal WM lesions by diffusion-based ex vivo high-field quantitative MRI and found that cases with mVBI and low AD Vol.: (0123456789) pathology displayed no abnormalities, but a significant loss of FA was detected in cases with mVBI and high AD pathology 25. In the present study, we examined the associations between vasodilator function of WM-penetrating arterioles and quantitative DTI parameters (ADC and FA) in cases with mVBI and ADNC mixed pathology. In cases with low ADNC (with or without mVBI), the magnitude of WM arteriole dilation was significantly correlated with higher FA and lower ADC values, indicating that vasomotor dysfunction was closely associated with pathological microstructural changes in the WM in these cases. Interestingly, the association between penetrating arteriole dilation and FA and also ADC were lost in cases with high ADNC, which can be due to the markedly reduced vasodilator responses of WM arterioles in most of these cases. These observations suggests that ADNCrelated pathological changes in the WM may better correlate with microvascular vasodilator dysfunction when compared to MRI-detected WM microstructural changes in patients with high ADNC.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "One limitation of our study was the small sample size for studies of gene expression of pial surface and WM penetrating arterioles, which yielded acceptable RNA quality only in four subjects in each group. These studies were not sufficiently powered to provide plausible links for the impaired vasomotor reactivity observed in this study. It should be also noted that assessment of eNOS and NOX gene expression does not directly indicate the bioavailability of NO, which should be evaluated in future mechanistic studies. We also note that in the present study, bradykinin was used as a pharmacological agonist to assess the magnitude of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in isolated cerebral arteries. Interestingly, under pathological conditions, bradykinin plays multiple roles in the neurovascular unit, including regulation of blood brain barrier permeability and inflammatory cytokine release that may also contribute to astrocyte and microglial activation 62. The role of bradykinin in mixed vascular (mVBI) and ADNC in affecting WMpenetrating arteriole vasomotor response and other AD-related pathological changes in the neurovascular unit has yet to be elucidated. In addition, the small sample size for the four patient groups also limited the analysis of associations related to microvascular vasodilator dysfunction and MRI-detected abnormal WM microstructural changes.",

    "Perspectives": {
      "text": "Our study supports a role for independent and synergistic contributions of mVBI and AD to cerebral microvascular and AD neuropathological changes in aging human brain. Since there are no reliable tissue biomarkers for mVBI, our results suggest the utility of cerebral microvascular endothelial dysfunction to determine the extent of mVBI in autopsy cases, which can be used to stratify patients and also define correlations with neuropathological and noninvasive neuroimaging parameters. While the mixed effects of AD and mVBI appear to have a synergistic impact on cerebral microvascular dysfunction and WM injury, several outstanding questions remain. Both AD and cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure, are similarly detrimental to the cerebral microvasculature, which undergoes pronounced functional and structural changes. The nature of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which WM parenchymal arterioles are selectively affected and are more vulnerable and less capable of tolerating fluctuations of cerebral blood flow under the combination of these pathological conditions is an area of active investigation. Underlying mechanisms through which WM-penetrating arteriole dysfunction leads to WM microstructural changes in patients with low or high ADNC also remain poorly understood. Consistent with this notion, in this study, we found that WM-penetrating arteriole responses to bradykinin were more significantly associated with MRI-defined diffusion changes in patients with low ADNC, but were lost in cases where vasomotor responses were mostly diminished in high ADNC. In this context, we previously found that vasodilator dysfunction of WM-penetrating arterioles is accompanied by reactive gliosis that involves astrocytes and microglia 24. Dysfunction of WM-penetrating arterioles leads to hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative nitrosative stress that contribute to axon and myelin damage due to the failure in maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes 24. It is therefore possible that mixed mVBI and ADNC is accompanied by exaggerated damage selectively to the WM. Through Vol:. (1234567890) this process, it is also possible that vasomotor dysfunction of cerebral parenchymal arterioles as well as pathological hemodynamic changes, such as seen in hypertension, can lead to the direct, vascular celldependent activation of astrocytes 63,64. Cerebral WM microvascular-mediated phenotypic changes in astrocytes can also affect the upstream propagation of vasodilator signaling, thereby preventing both local (WM) and pial surface artery-dependent control of cerebral blood flow. This scenario however has yet to be demonstrated in human studies.\nTaken together, our findings support that WMpenetrating arteriole dysfunction commonly occurs in aging-associated WM injury and raises the potential for worse cognitive dysfunction and memory deficits in patients with comorbid mVBI and AD. However, future functional imaging studies that simultaneously assess cerebral WM perfusion and test for cognitive function are needed to provide direct mechanistic links and insights. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human cerebral microvascular dysfunction lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby offering novel avenues for targeted preventive strategies for VCID and AD.",

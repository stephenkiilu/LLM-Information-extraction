    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND) refers to cognitive deficits associated with underlying vascular causes that are insufficient to confirm a diagnosis of dementia. The default mode network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network of interacting brain regions involved in attention, working memory and executive function. The role of DMN white matter integrity in cognitive deficits of VCIND patients is unclear. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this study was carried out to investigate white matter microstructural changes in the DMN in VCIND patients and their contributions to cognitive deficits. Thirty-one patients with subcortical VCIND and twenty-two healthy elderly subjects were recruited. All patients underwent neuropsychological assessments and DTI examination. Voxel-based analyses were performed to extract fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures in the DMN. Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, patients diagnosed with subcortical VCIND presented with abnormal white matter integrity in several key hubs of the DMN. The severity of damage in the white matter microstructure in the DMN significantly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. Mediation analyses demonstrated that DTI values could account for attention, executive and language impairments, and partly mediated global cognitive dysfunction in the subcortical VCIND patients. DMN integrity is significantly impaired in subcortical VCIND patients. The disrupted DMN connectivity could explain the attention, language and executive dysfunction, which indicates that the white matter integrity of the DMN may be a neuroimaging marker for VCIND.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebrovascular disease remains a leading cause of death and disability in older people worldwide (Mansfield et al. 2018). In addition to causing physical disabilities, cerebrovascular disease could also contribute to cognitive impairment. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to all forms of cognitive dysfunction consisting of a complex interaction of cerebrovascular disease and risk factors that lead to changes in brain structures due to strokes and lesions (Skrobot et al. 2018). VCI ranges from subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (vascular cognitive impairment, no dem e n t i a ; V C I N D ) t o o v e r t d e m e n t i a ( v a s c u l a r dementia) (Sachdev et al. 2014). Vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia refers to cognitive deficits associated with underlying vascular causes that fall short of a diagnosis of dementia (Stephan et al. 2009). According to the China Cognition and Aging Study, VCIND is the most common subtype of mild cognitive dysfunction in China, accounting for 42.0 of the total cases (Jia et al. 2014). The Canadian Study of Health and Aging pointed out that 50  of VCIND patients progressed to dementia over 5 years of followup (Rockwood et al. 2000). Therefore, it is very important for us to investigate the brain alterations in VCIND subjects.\nSubcortical VCIND manifests as white matter hyperintensities or lacunes in subcortical white matter and the basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and these regions contribute to cognitive deficits(van de Pol et al. 2007). However, the role of white matter hyperintensity in cognitive deficits is still controversial. Previous studies suggested that the white matter hyperintensity severity rather than the distribution correlates with cognitive deficits (Fazekas et al. 1996), whereas other studies came to the opposite conclusion(de Vocht 2007; Debette et al. 2007;Mirsen et al. 1991). The inconsistency may arise from methodological differences in evaluating white matter hyperintensity. One potential factor is the variability in the pathologies that underlie white matter hyperintensity. These white matter hyperintensities could be composed of various lesions, ranging from multiple small cavitations, marked arteriosclerosis and mild perivascular alterations to loss of various tracts (Fazekas et al. 1993). Another potential factor that can explain these inconsistencies is the poor discrimination of absolute lesion volume and the visual rating scales of white matter hyperintensity displaying a ceiling effect (Kim et al. 2011;van Straaten et al. 2006). Therefore, precise measurements are needed to reveal the role of white matter hyperintensities in cognitive deficits in patients with subcortical VCIND.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based technique, is a noninvasive measurement used for delineating specific white matter structures in vivo (Nitkunan et al. 2006). A recent study demonstrated that abnormal DTI parameters significantly correlated with the level of metabolite contents of neurons, suggesting that DTI can identify axonal disruption in the white matter tracts (Robinson et al. 2016). DTI detects white matter microstructural alterations by measuring the directionality of molecular diffusion (fractional anisotropy, FA) and the average motion of water molecules (mean diffusivity, MD) (Xu et al. 2010). However, most DTI studies have used manual tracing of regions of interest (ROIs) and thus included only limited regions or assessing whole brain areas (OSullivan et al. 2004) rather than neural networks. Recent dementia studies have pointed out that neurodegenerative diseases are considered brain network diseases due to the failure to integrate certain brain regions into an efficient network and the disconnections within neural networks (Della Nave et al. 2007;Zhou et al. 2008). The default mode network (DMN) is one of the most important brain networks involved in executive and attention function (Buckner et al. 2008). It was first introduced by Raichle (Raichle et al. 2001) and colleagues and has gained increasing attention from the neurology and neuroscience communities ever since (Rosazza and Minati 2011). This network is composed of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the adjacent precuneus (pCu), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the medial temporal lobes (MTL), medial prefrontal areas (mPFC) and the inferior parietal cortex. This set of regions is intensely activated during the resting state and de-activated during the demanding tasks requiring focused attention such as visual-spatial tasks and working memory tasks (Corbetta and Shulman 2002). Activation of the DMN regions also correlates with other networks during executive tasks (Leech et al. 2011). Convergent evidence demonstrates DMN connectivity alterations in AD and MCI patients (Agosta et al. 2013;Chua et al. 2008;Filippi et al. 2013;Li et al. 2019;Weiler et al. 2014;Zhan et al. 2016), and these alterations have been found to be related to the severity and the progression of the disease (Hansen et al. 2014;Mintun et al. 2006). Additionally, in VaD, decreased DMN functional connectivity has been reported using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) (Kim et al. 2011). While fMRI provides an indirect evaluation of neural activity, DTI is a direct measurement of white matter structural integrity.\nTo date, little is known regarding white matter structural integrity in the DMN in VCIND patients and even less is known regarding its role in cognitive deficits. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to investigate the contributions of white matter microstructural abnormalities in the DMN to cognitive impairment in patients with subcortical VCIND. In pursuit of this, using the DTI method, we investigate white matter tract integrity in the DMN and the cognitive consequences of this hypothesized disconnection in subcortical VCIND.",

Participants who had disorders other than subcortical VCIND that would affect cognition or any conditions that would preclude completion of neuropsychological testing were excluded.\nAll patients meeting the clinical criteria underwent MRI screening including a hippocampal assessment. The MRIbased entry criteria details were as follows: (1) multiple (3) supratentorial subcortical small infarcts (3-20 mm in diameter) withwithout white matter lesions of any degree or moderate to severe white matter lesions (Fazekas rating scale score  2) (Fazekas et al. 1987); withwithout small infarcts;\n(2) absence of cortical or watershed infarcts, hemorrhages, hydrocephalus, or white matter lesions with specific causes (e.g., multiple sclerosis); and (3) no hippocampal or entorhinal cortex atrophy (score of 0 on the medial temporal lobe atrophy scale of Scheltens (Scheltens et al. 1992).\nTwenty-two healthy elderly subjects were recruited from the community and served as a normal control (NC) group.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The main aim of the present study was to detect the white matter microstructural changes in the default mode network As reported in previous studies, the conclusions about white matter microstructural changes in VCI patients have been controversial. On the one hand, researchers had found reduced FA and increased MD values only in a limited number of regions. For example, several studies found decreased FA in the anterior CC, frontal, and parietal white matter in VaD(H. J. Chen et al. 2018;Lin et al. 2015;Zarei et al. 2009). Other studies reported that FA decreased and ADC increased in the regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and centrum semiovale areas in VCI patients (Lopez-Oloriz et al. 2014;Sun et al. 2011). On the other hand, several groups have reported that VCIND patients had more widespread white matter changes. They found that FA values decreased and MD values increased in all supratentorial white matter, including the frontal lobes, parietal lobes, temporal lobes, occipital lobes, and corpus callosum (Chua et al. 2008;Zhou et al. 2011). As previously mentioned, neurodegenerative diseases could be considered as brain network diseases due to the disconnection within neural networks and the failure to integrate certain brain regions into an efficient network(S. Q. Chen et al. 2016;Della Nave et al. 2007;Zhou et al. 2008). The DMN is one of the most important brain networks involved in attention and executive function (Qiu et al. 2009). Hence, the present study confirmed the role of white matter microstructural changes in the DMN in cognitive deficits in patients with subcortical VCIND.\nPrevious studies have reported correlations between cognitive impairments and white matter microstructural changes as reflected by DTI metrics in VaD patients (Kim et al. 2011;Thong et al. 2014;Xu et al. 2010;Zhou et al. 2008Zhou et al. , 2011)). However, no conclusions had been drawn regarding VCIND patients yet. Our current findings demonstrate that damages in white matter tracts already contribute to cognitive impairment in the early stage of VCI. A noteworthy hypothesis to explain the cognitive impairment in VCIND patients is that nerve tract damage results in a disconnection syndrome due to the disruption of large tracts of white matter (Chua et al. 2008;Lin et al. 2015). Our results, in line with previous results, provided additional evidence that damage to white matter tracts might be an important mechanism of cognitive impairment in VCIND patients.\nIt is known that executive and attention dysfunction, but not memory loss, are characteristic impairments in patients with subcortical VCIND (Seo et al. 2010(Seo et al. , 2012)). Here, within the DMN, correlation analyses revealed that DTI values were (Hachinski et al. 2006). Previous researchers found that MoCA showed better sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of vascular cognitive dysfunction (Pinto et al. 2018). Our results further demonstrated that MoCA is highly correlated with white matter integrity compared to MMSE for general cognitive assessments in patients with subcortical VCIND. As the most commonly used screening tool for cognitive function, MoCA seems to be superior to MMSE in the identification and detection of of VCI, and more related to white matter integrity damage.\nA potential limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the current study. Longitudinal observations from early stage VCIND to dementia would help us to better understand the dynamic changes in the role of the DMN in the cognitive deficits of VCI. The present study was based in a single hospital and had a relatively small sample size. Studies combining population-based multicenter research and large sample sizes should be promoted in the future. Moreover, as demonstrated by post-mortem studies, the co-occurrence of VCI and other neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly is very frequent (Debette et al. 2007). When we selected patients, we have performed various physical and auxiliary examinations to exclude the possibility of co-existing neurodegenerative diseases. However, we could not completely exclude the possibility that the VCIND patients included in our study might also suffer from other confounding preclinical cognitive disorders. A further cross-validation study with properly controlled diagnostic biomarkers for AD, Lewy body diseases, etc. would be needed. Additionally, the associations between white matter integrity and other fibers might enhance our understanding about the brain connectivity and brain function in VCI subjects, therefore, some related analysis should be performed in the future. Finally, it should be noted that we cannot infer that the cognitive changes are specifically associated with white matter changes in the DMN and not driven by generalized white matter changes or changes in other networks. In fact, we have investigated the altered patterns among other regions area using a latest well-used Brainnetome Atlas (Fan et al. 2016), and around 0.1-0.5 connections showed impaired FA or MD properties in VCIND subjects. Hence, additional work to investigate the specific change of brain network in VCIND are needed in the future studies.\nIn conclusion, the current study revealed significant white matter integrity damage in the DMN in patients with subcortical VCIND. The damage in DMN white matter tracts mediated the characteristic cognitive deficits in VCIND patients, including executive function and attention. The microstructural white matter evaluation could provide insight into the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments in VCIND, as well as potential imaging biomarkers.",

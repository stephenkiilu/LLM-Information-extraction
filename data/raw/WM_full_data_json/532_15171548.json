    "abstract": "Objective: To determine the relationship between the extent of the damage and clinical data in Alzheimers disease (AD). Methods: Twenty-two patients with AD and twenty-two controls received MR-diffusion tensor scanning. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of white matter in AD patients were measured respectively in parietal lobe and the genu of corpus callosum. Independent-samples t-test for nonpaired data was used to test differences between AD and controls for FA values. Correlation analysis was applied to reveal the correlations between FA values in each region and the MMSE, FOM, RVR, BD and DS scores. Results: Positive correlations were found between FA values in left parietal lobe and FOMDS, and between FA values in genu of corpus callosum and MMSE scores. Conclusions: In AD, the MR-DTI can reflect the relationship between the degree of white matter abnormalities and the cognitive impairment.",

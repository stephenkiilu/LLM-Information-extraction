    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most prevalent form of dementia, but little is known about the early cognitive and neuroimaging markers. Spatial navigation deficits are an emerging marker for Alzheimers disease (AD), yet less is known about spatial orientation deficits sensitive to VCI. This case report follows up on the first VCI patient identified to have an egocentric orientation deficit. The study aimed to examine the patients spatial deficits three years on and gain insights from the addition of the patients MRI brain scan. A battery of spatial navigation tasks were administered following neuropsychological assessment. Results continue to show spatial orientation deficits. Critically, these changes appear stable and are sensitive to novel spatial tests. Whereas conventional screening tools demonstrate patient recovery. MRI DTI analysis indicates a non-significant trend towards loss of structural integrity to the posterior tracts of the longitudinal superior fasciculus (SLF), while the medial temporal lobe, typically implicated in spatial navigation, is unaffected. This finding potentially reflects reduced network connectivity in posterior to anterior white matter tracts co-existing with spatial orientation deficits. Findings have clinical utility and show spatial orientation as a potential sensitive cognitive marker for VCI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is thought to account for at least 20 of the clinical population affected by dementia 1, second in prevalence only to Alzheimers disease 2. Despite this, the cognitive features specific to VCI are still being explored. Multidomain impairments are apparent but executive dysfunction is most frequently associated with the condition 3. This cognitive heterogeneity is likely due to the diverse nature of VCI, ranging from microinfarcts to white matter hyperintensities (WMH) 456. Microinfarcts in particular can affect several cortical and subcortical regions 7, accounting for the cognitive heterogeneity in VCI patients. By contrast, WMH are more consistent in their location and show a propensity to the superior longitudinal fasciculus 8910.\nThe Superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is a major white matter pathway in the brain, connecting frontal and parietal brain regions. We have previously hypothesised that disruption of the SLF should not only result in subtle frontally-mediated executive change but also medial parietal-mediated, egocentric spatial orientation changes 11. Changes to the way we navigate can be a key marker for neurodegeneration 12,13. Fronto-parietal mediated egocentric orientation is concerned with the spatial relation between objects or landmarks and the self. It is focused on processing spatial information from a person-centred perspective. While our allocentric frame of reference involves the spatial relation between the position of objects and landmarks relative to each other and is focused on map-based representations. Both frames are informed by spatial information from multi-faceted person-to-object centred and environmental cues 14. Both are required for everyday navigation with egocentric and allocentric processes shifting in response to navigational demands 15. Indeed, a previous publication of ours shows that egocentric spatial navigation tests are highly sensitive to VCI and distinguish it reliably not only from healthy people but also Alzheimers disease 16, though see 17. These egocentric spatial orientation measures might provide a promising cognitive diagnostic and treatment outcome measure for WMH in VCI, specifically. However, at this stage it is not clear how those WMH changes co-exist with egocentric spatial orientation changes over time. This current study tries to address this outstanding question by testing a single VCI case over a three-year period. RK, the 67-year-old VCI patient first presented to our memory service in 2017. At that time RK presented with egocentric and heading direction deficits 18.\nHere, we now present the follow-up assessment of RK, along with SLF neuroimaging, to determine if egocentric spatial orientation deficits exist in RK after a three-year period and how they relate to WMH to the SLF. This will inform how consistent spatial orientation changes are in VCI and explore how they relate to the underlying brain integrity. The study aims to inform future cognitive diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for VCI.",

RK received a diagnosis of vascular dementia (aka VCI) in March 2017 at our dementia research clinic. Diagnosis was classified by a consultant at the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust by interviewing the patient, patients medical history, examining neuropsychological assessment scores and clinical CT scan which met the diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia (VCI) 19. His medical history included hypercholesterolaemia, stage 2 hypertension, an elevated BMI, life-long cigarette smoking, as well as a strong family history of hypercholesterolaemia and heart disease. RK and his care-giver report advancing memory problems and an increased need for daily-living assistance from time 1 (t1) to time 2 (t2), although he remains independent in leaving the house to walk to the local shop daily (see, Table 1 for changes in physical characteristics from time 1 to time 2). We have compared new case control participants as time 2 follow up data was unavailable from the original cohort. The new case controls (N  14) were recruited from the local community and had a mean age of 67.79 (SD  3.17), nine males and five females. Their cardiovascular health indicative of VCI pathology, was assessed using QRisk3-2018 20 to calculate their cardiovascular disease risk (heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years), all controls had a score of 10. The controls underwent a battery of cognitive tests (see, Table 2) and demonstrated healthy cognitive function.

The spatial orientation measures consisted of the Virtual Supermarket Test and the Clock Orientation Test, both of which were sensitive to RKs egocentric impairments at t1, and the addition of Sea Hero Quest was introduced at t2 as a further assessment of egocentric and allocentric spatial ability. The iPad tasks were completed with participants sitting approximately 30 cms from the screen which was situated flat on a desk in front of them. MRI scanning took place by radiologists at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Tests were administered in the same order for each participant and breaks were given as requested.

The VR task is an ecological test of spatial navigation abilities designed to simulate navigating through a real-world supermarket. While at t1, a paper version of the supermarket map (allocentric measure) was used, an alternative form of this measure was employed 3 years later at re-test (t2), to facilitate electronic and automatic recording of participant responses.

It requires participants to imagine they are standing in the centre of a large clock, facing a particular number, e.g., the number 3. Participants are then asked, which number is directly behind you? (Answer: number 9). Next participants are asked to point, in real-life, to the positions of different numbers on the clock face in relation to the number that they are currently facing. For example, You are facing number 12, can you point to the number 3? (Answer: pointing right). The questions increase in complexity across the test and require medial parietal mediated mental imagery, rotation and egocentric processes, with no episodic memory demand. The test consists of 12 trials and takes 5-10 min to complete.",

SHQ is an app-based cognitive task that enables the collection of spatial navigation data and is used in large scale population based studies 32 and has been shown to differentiate egocentric and allocentric frames of reference, exhibiting selective wayfinding allocentric deficits in prodromal Alzheimers disease 33. SHQ goal-orientated wayfinding (allocentric) levels 6, 8 and 11 were selected due to their previous sensitivity to identifying pre-clinical AD 34. Players initially see a map featuring a start location and several checkpoints to find in a set order. Participants study a map of the level for a recorded number of seconds. When participants exit the map view, they are asked to immediately find the checkpoints in the order indicated on the map under timed conditions. As participants navigate the boat, they must keep track of their location using self-motion and environmental landscape cues such as water-land separation. If the participant takes more than a set time, an arrow appears pointing in the direction along the Euclidean line to the goal to aid navigation. In flare accuracy (egocentric) levels (here, levels 14, 19, 24, 34 and 44), participants are not provided with an allocentric map. Instead, they immediately navigated along a river to find a flare gun. Once they find the flare gun at the end of the river, the boat rotates by 180  , and participants are asked to choose one of three possible directions (right, front, and left) that they believe points to the starting point. This level requires participants to (i) form an accurate representation of the starting point relative to their position and (ii) integrate this representation with a representation of the direction they are facing after the rotation. Depending on their performance, players receive one, two, or three stars (Fig. 2).",

Subsequently the data was processed in order to account for geometric distortions, this was performed on the mean b0 image via the T1-w scan. In order to achieve distortion correction, the T1-w scan was rigidly aligned with the mean b0 image 36 and the mean b0 image was nonlinearly registered to this T1-w scan in diffusion space using Advanced Normalization Tools (http:stnava. github.ioANTs). The resulting nonlinear registration information was used to unwarp subsequent diffusion-weighted images in native diffusion space.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The current case report replicates our previous findings in showing egocentric spatial orientation deficits in VCI. More importantly, we demonstrate that spatial orientation deficits persist while other cognitive scores show no changes or even improvement over time. At the same time, spatial orientation deficits appear to co-exist with changes to the posterior SLF, making them highly specific to the WMH in VCI in that region. In particular, fractional anisotropy suggests potential reduced white matter integrity to the left and right SLF parietal sections may appear linked to spatial orientation deficits in VCI.\nResults suggest RKs general cognition improved from t1 to t2 in measures of the ACE-III, VOSP, INECO and TMT. The FCSRT remained stable from t1 to t2 for RK. Interestingly, RKs scores would only indicate a clinical cut-off for dementia on the INECO, ROCF-recall and FCSRT (see, Appendix. B). Although, the uplift in scores may be due to test retest effects which are a common problem in neuropsychological Table 3 Total scores, standard deviations (SD), Z-case control (Zcc) scores, confidence intervals from a modified paired samples t-test for patient and control group on the Spatial Battery at Time 2. assessment 39. It is important to consider changes in RKs medical management. Since t1, RKs hypothyroidism is being medically managed which may explain an uplift in his cognitive abilities as hypothyroidism has been associated with deficits to memory and executive function which is reversible with effective treatment 40. Despite some uplift in results, spatial tests suggest RK remains to have an egocentric deficit when assessed by the Virtual Supermarket Test, the Clock Orientation Test and Sea Hero Quest compared to healthy controls. However, RK now shows an allocentric deficit at follow-up testing compared to controls in the Virtual Supermarket Test, despite showing improvements from t1. This stands in contrast to RKs general cognition which remained stable or improved at follow-up when assessed by standard clinical neuropsychological assessment in domains of attention, fluency, language, and visuospatial processing (see Table 2). Perhaps suggesting RK has consistently had both egocentric and allocentric deficits with instead inconsistencies occurring between the control groups. There are large standard variations in performance for the control groups at both t1 to t2 for allocentric ability on the VST, with the controls at t2 scoring worse on the spatial tasks than the controls at t1 (see, Appendix. A). This confound is difficult to explain, although we know as age increases spatial abilities become poorer 41,42. The mean age at t1 was 63 years old (SD  4.8), compared to the mean age of 67.79 years old (SD  3.17) at t2. Suggesting the controls at t2 were better matched to RKs age and therefore may show greater integrity for comparison of RKs performance than scores at time one. In sum, it appears RKs spatial impairments are apparent in both egocentric and allocentric spatial frames. This finding is consistent with recent evidence suggesting reduced spatial orientation performance in the in prodromal individuals predicts dementia onset in multiple dementia sub-types (VCI, AD, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia) 13. Critically, in this study egocentric and allocentric changes were detected using novel spatial testing and were undetected when using standard neuropsychological assessments specifically targeting spatial processing when comparing RKs scores from t1 to t2 (see, Table 2). Perhaps due to the greater sensitivity than pen and paper testing, as well as strong test-retest reliability 43.\nIt is commonly recognised that egocentric and allocentric reference frames use separate neurocognitive pathways mediated by different neural structures 44454647, but these frames can work in parallel with one another 48. Egocentric frames can be used alone but there is evidence to suggest allocentric representations require the translation of sensory and imagery input from transient egocentric representations 49. Rodent models of spatial processing suggest egocentric sensory information travels through parietal cortex in order to elicit place cell firing in the hippocampus, which is key to the translation of map based allocentric representations 50, it is also suggested human allocentric map based hippocampal representations are driven from inputs from dorsal and ventral visual pathways overlapping posterior parietal regions 51. As such, our results could be viewed in the context of this integrated model of allocentric representations, which may explain reduced allocentric performance due to egocentric posterior parietal damage in patient RK. In support of this, the demands of allocentric metric of the Virtual Supermarket Test require the participant to view a map of the supermarket and indicate their current position. As well as medial temporal map-based processing, this may also call on visual imagery and short-term spatial memory mediated by medial parietal structures 52,53 to reconstruct their steps taken to arrive at the end location. Although, allocentric deficits were not observed when tested using SHQ, RK took considerably longer to complete the Wayfinding (allocentric) levels compared to controls. As such, the egocentric mechanisms affected in RK could be interfering with the formation of allocentric representations. Future studies in a larger sample of mild to moderate VCI patients are required to explore this potential explanation further.\nMRI analysis using FLAIR imaging indicates RK has white matter hyperintensities to the right hemisphere frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter, as well as periventricular white matter lesions near the lateral ventricles, close to the colossal body and the superior division of the lateral occipital cortex. Although WMH are also common in healthy ageing 55, the MRI profile is consistent with typical subcortical ischaemic presentation of VCI 4. However, further DTI analysis was used to assess white matter integrity in SLF and results suggest FA was reduced in all four SLF tracts for RK compared to controls. Although differences did not reach statistical significance, a trend towards significance was strongest for the left and right SLF parietal sections. This findings is not conclusive, but supports the notion that reduced integrity to the posterior tracts of the SLF may be a potential hallmark of VCI 11, and could manifest as this apparent egocentric orientation deficit.\nNeuroimaging studies emphasise the role of medial and posterior parietal regions in computing egocentric spatial representations 49,56 and research examining the application of virtual reality assessing early neurodegeneration suggest reduced right hemisphere precuneus volumes are associated with poorer egocentric performance 57. These findings are paralleled by our present results and may suggest posterior regions of the SLF connecting the parietal-to-frontal structures may be implicated in this apparent egocentric decline in spatial orientation observed in RK and our previous VCI patient group study 16.\nThis case report comes as further evidence to support the use of spatial navigation testing in clinical settings and serves as a sensitive diagnostic tool in the assessment of VCI. The continued sensitivity of The Virtual Supermarket test and the Clock Orientation Test to RKs condition, in light of improved scores on conventional cognitive assessments (ACE-III, VOSP, INECO, TMT), suggest these simple and quick to administer spatial tasks would also be a favourable sensitive cognitive measure for use in VCI intervention studies.\nDespite these exciting findings, our study has limitations, RKs MRI scan took place three years after his initial diagnosis. Therefore RKs brain imaging should be interpreted with caution when associating findings with his initial (t1) test scores. Although, reduced integrity to the posterior SLF is of interest concerning his egocentric spatial deficits, FLAIR MRI indicates multiple sites of white matter hyperintensities to suggest axonal loss more typical of a subcortical ischaemic VCI 4. Type one errors are also identified when using small control groups and Crawford and Howells (1998) modified paired sample t-test 58. In addition, pre-existing healthy WMH load has also been shown to exhibit as reduced FA in the SLF 59. As such, we cannot be clear on the order of the pathogenesis of these injuries, thus, a link between egocentric deficits in VCI and posterior SLF integrity is not conclusive.\nFinally, although the utility of app-based spatial navigation tools such as the Virtual Supermarket Test and Sea Hero Quest to detect VCI pathology is clear, the task demands are multidimensional requiring a host of cognitive abilities (visuomotor, executive, working memory, language comprehension) that may be challenging in more advanced disease stages. RKs results should also be discussed in the context of dysexecutive syndrome 54, whereby fronto-parietal function is impaired but medial temporal function remains intact. Results from INECO and FCSRT free recall tests suggest frontal executive problems and fronto-parietal functions including visual imagery, planning and spatial working memory are critical to spatial navigation. Therefore, future studies should consider the syndrome in the context of VCI.\nCritically, these injuries observed in RKs MRI could be sensitive to novel spatial tests but go undetected on visuospatial measures of neuropsychological assessment. Future studies are needed to explore potential parietal-to-frontal network disruption in the early stages of VCI to inform the pathogenesis of spatial disruptions.",

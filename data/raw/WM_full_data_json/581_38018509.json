    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "With a globally aging population, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are steadily increasing, with estimates of dementia prevalence reaching 1 in 85 persons by 2050. 1 Given these progressive trends, studies have sought to identify modifiable risk factors as targets for early intervention and disease mitigation. While hearing loss among older patients has historically been considered an inevitable sequala of aging, recent research identifies hearing loss as potentially the largest modifiable risk factor for development of dementia. 2,3 These recommendations derive from data that demonstrated an increased likelihood of developing dementia among patients with increasingly poor audiometric performance. 456 Several underlying mechanisms have been hypothesized to account for the association between hearing loss and cognitive impairment. It has been hypothesized that hearing loss may directly lead to cortical atrophy through the increased cognitive demands for processing auditory information. 7 However, as social isolation, depression, and loneliness have all been associated with cognitive decline, several groups have suggested an indirect link between hearing loss and declining cognitive performance over time. 8,9 High-resolution neuroimaging is increasingly used to examine the functional and anatomic connectivity changes accompanying hearing loss in cognitively impaired individuals. 101112 Several imaging modalities have been employed for neuroanatomical characterization, including structural MRI (sMRI), fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI (FLAIR-MRI), diffusion tensor imaging MRI (DTI-MRI), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). In addition to structural characterization, WMH has been found to be a marker for late cerebrovascular disease (CVD). 13,14 DTI-MRI is employed to measure fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of axonal diameter, myelin structure, or fiber density in a given area, that has been associated with early CVD. 15 FDG-PET is employed to measure glucose utilization, and while neurometabolism decreases globally with age, specific hypometabolic patterns associate with dementia. 16 The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) is a prospective, population-based study initiated in 2004 to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiology and risk factors of MCI and dementia in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Using the MCSA, the primary aim of the current work was to investigate the association between standard pure tone and speech audiometry with neuroimaging characteristics reflective of aging and dementia in older adults.",

    "Participant Selection": {
      "text": "Following approval from Institutional Review Board (IRB: 20-004354) a review was undertaken. Participants who enrolled in the MCSA from November 2004 to December 2019 with a status of cognitively unimpaired or MCI were eligible for study. Characteristics from 4 imaging modalities were of interest: 1 and 2) sMRI and FLAIR-MRI using a 3T GE scanner, in use in the MCSA from August 2005 to December 2017; 3) the DTI-MRI sequence, in use from November 2009 to December 2017; and 4) FDG-PET, in use from January 2009 to the end of the current study. Imaging studies of interest were performed as a part of the MCSA for research purposes to examine neuroanatomic changes associated with MCI and dementia on prospectively enrolled MCSA participants. The first available imaging date of each modality was selected to represent the baseline imaging for each participant. Because the most significant brain changes with aging occur after 60 years of age, we restricted to participants 60 years old or older at the baseline imaging date. An audiogram within 5 years of the baseline imaging date was identified to represent the degree of hearing loss associated with baseline imaging. For participants with multiple audiograms, the audiogram closest to the baseline imaging date was selected.",

Hearing rehabilitation was ascertained by electronic retrieval of patient-provided information from surveys completed during Mayo Clinic visits and searches of diagnosis and procedure codes for hearing aids and cochlear implants, as previously described. 17",

Subjective hearing difficulties that interfere with daily activities were assessed during the interview with the participants study partners (informants, selected by the participant) during the visit associated with the imaging date.

We defined abnormal WMH as 1.62 after mapping the cutoff from a previously published method to our current values. 18",

      "text": "Cross-sectional associations of PTA, WRS, and hearing difficulties interfering with daily activities with baseline neuroimaging outcomes were evaluated using linear regression models for the continuous outcomes and logistic regression models for the dichotomous outcome. Associations with longitudinal changes in neuroimaging outcomes over time were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models with random participant-specific intercepts and slopes using an unstructured covariance structure. All regression models were adjusted for the baseline covariates of age, sex, years of education, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, APOE ε4 carriership, and hearing rehabilitation. 17 Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). All tests were two-sided and p-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Participants could be included in multiple cohorts; for example, 303 participants were included in the sMRI, FLAIR-MRI, DTI-MRI, and FDG-PET cohorts, although the baseline imaging dates were not necessarily the same across all 4 modalities. Median duration (in absolute value) from the audiogram to the baseline neuroimaging date was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7-2.6) for sMRI and FLAIR-MRI, 1.5 years (IQR 0.7-2.7) for DTI-MRI, and 1.7 years (IQR 0.7-3.0) for FDG-PET.",

    "Cross-sectional Analysis": {
      "text": "Cross-sectional associations of hearing loss with baseline neuroimaging outcomes indicated that none of the hearing loss exposures studied were significantly associated with cortical thickness measures from sMRI. However, each 10-dB HL increase in PTA was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of abnormal WMH (odds ratio 1.26; p0.02) from FLAIR-MRI. PTA 25 dB HL, representing any degree of hearing loss, was also significantly associated with abnormal WMH (odds ratio 1.88; p0.03) (Table 2; Figure 1). Although WMH as a percentage of total intracranial volume was primarily analyzed as abnormal versus normal, associations of hearing loss with this outcome analyzed as continuous (after transforming to the natural log scale to satisfy the underlying assumption of normality) were also explored; the results were comparable to those summarized in Table 2. From DTI-MRI, participants with 100 WRSs had significantly lower FA in the corpus callosum as a whole (parameter estimate -0.008; p0.04) and specifically within the body (parameter estimate -0.010; p0.03) and genu (parameter estimate -0.012; p0.008) of the corpus callosum when compared with participants with perfect WRSs (Table 3; Figure 2). From FDG-PET, each 10 decrease in WRSs was associated with a significantly decreased uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex (parameter estimate -0.013; p0.001) (Table 4; Figure 3).",

    "Longitudinal Analysis": {
      "text": "A summary of the participant cohorts available for associations of hearing loss with longitudinal changes in neuroimaging outcomes over time is shown in Supplemental Table 1. Associations of PTA, WRS, and hearing difficulties interfering with daily activities with longitudinal changes in sMRI and FLAIR-MRI, DTI-MRI, and FDG-PET neuroimaging outcomes over time are summarized in Supplemental Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The parameter estimates in these tables represent the rates of change in neuroimaging outcomes per year for each level of exposure studied. For example, the parameter estimates for changes in frontal lobe thickness from sMRI were -0.004 and -0.005 for participants with normal hearing (PTA 25 dB HL) and participants with hearing loss (PTA25 dB HL), respectively (Supplemental Table 2). Put another way, frontal lobe thickness decreased by 0.004 mm per year, on average, for those with normal hearing compared with 0.005 mm per year for those with hearing loss. These estimates are expected to be negative, representing declines in frontal lobe thickness over time, and indeed the 95 CIs around both estimates indicate statistically significant declines. However, the p-value of 0.4 for the interaction term between hearing loss and time indicates that the rate of decline was not significantly steeper for participants with hearing loss compared with those with normal hearing. There were no statistically significant differences between participants with better or poorer audiometric performance when looking at rates of deterioration over time in the sMRI, FLAIR-MRI, DTI-MRI, and FDG-PET neuroimaging outcomes under study.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this prospective, population-based cohort study, worsening audiometric performance was associated with specific neuroimaging findings on cross-sectional assessment. Worsening PTA was not significantly associated with cortical thinning but was significantly associated with abnormal WMH, and worsening WRS was significantly associated with decreased FA in the body and genu of the corpus callosum as well as decreased FDG-PET uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex. When assessing associations of hearing loss with declines in neuroimaging outcomes over time, we did not identify any statistically significant differences in the rate of deterioration of brain area thickness, WMH, FA of the corpus callosum, or FDG-PET uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex across a range of audiometric measures.\nIn the present cohort, we used sMRI to measure thickness of each lobe of the brain. Due to the anatomic localization of the auditory cortex within the temporal lobe, previous authors have specifically examined this area for imaging associations with hearing loss. Two recent studies based on the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging reported significant temporal lobe volume differences when comparing participants with hearing loss to normal hearing participants, and steeper rates of volume loss in participants with greater degrees of hearing loss in midlife. 12,19 In our data, we did not find any significant differences in temporal lobe thickness when comparing a range of audiometric performance characteristics, although we did not specifically look at the volume of the temporal lobe.\nUsing FLAIR-MRI, we identified a significant association between audiometric performance and WMH. Interestingly, while WMH has been implicated in a wide range of cognitive deficits ranging from MCI to dementia, there are limited data on the associations of hearing loss with this outcome. In patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, worse hearing outcomes were found in patients who had periventricular WMH, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. 20,21 Eckert et al. reported a significant association between low-frequency hearing loss and periventricular WMH among aging women with a history of hypertension. 22 Our finding of an association of worsening PTA with abnormal WMH suggests an underlying pathophysiologic connection between PTA and CVD, although causality cannot be inferred from these findings.\nWith DTI-MRI sequences, we identified a significant association between worsening audiometric performance and decreased FA in the genu and body of the corpus callosum. Broadly, the corpus callosum is the primary connection of white matter projections between the right and left cerebral hemispheres, with a topographical organization where auditory, visual, and somatosensory information are conducted posteriorly and higher cognitive functions communicate anteriorly. 23 Armstrong et al. compared mean diffusivity and FA of the corpus callosum between hearing impaired and normal hearing patients, and while they found decreased mean diffusivity in the body of the corpus callosum, they did not find statistically significant changes in FA between these patient groups. 24 FA of the corpus callosum has been implicated in CVD, with hypothesized differences in white matter microstructural injury associating with severity of neurologic dysfunction in the post-mortem state. 15 Taken in combination with the WMH findings, the changes in primarily FA of the genu of the corpus callosum observed in participants with WRS 100 further suggest a connection between hearing loss and CVD.\nWe found decreasing metabolic function within the anterior cingulate cortex with decreasing WRS. While the understanding of anterior cingulate cortex function continues to evolve, this area is primarily thought to be involved with emotional and cognitive processing 25 and is a region that is relevant to cognitive resilience. 26 Hypometabolism within the anterior cingulate cortex can be seen with advancing age, although larger decreases within this area are also seen with CVD and vascular dementia and are more specific to this etiology in comparison to Alzheimers disease. 27,28 Again, here we see the overlap between anatomic areas of hearing loss and markers of vascular dementia.\nWe did not observe significant differences between participants with better and poorer audiometric performance at baseline in rates of change over time within the neuroanatomic areas of interest in this study. Specifically, there were no statistically significant associations of hearing loss with increases in WMH, decreases in FA of the corpus callosum, or decreases in FDG-PET uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex over time, in contrast to the significant associations observed on cross-sectional analysis. The lack of statistically significant differences in rates of change by the degree of audiometric performance is consistent across the selected neuroimaging outcomes of interest within this study. The median duration of follow-up between the initial scan and the last follow-up scan ranged from 3 to 4 years across imaging modalities, which may not be sufficient time to distinguish slowly progressive neurologic changes between groups. This is especially true with CVD where the rate of brain changes is slower compared to neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, further longitudinal neuroimaging follow-up, as well as longitudinal hearing changes over time, could better delineate the neuroimaging associations that we observed to be significant on cross-sectional analysis.\nThere are several limitations to our study. Firstly, MCSA participants are drawn from the population of Olmsted County, which has an improved access to healthcare, elevated life span, and higher socioeconomic status than the general U.S. population, limiting the generalizability of our results. Secondly, there is a selection bias in the current study cohort who underwent standard audiometry as a result of concerns for hearing dysfunction as compared with the MCSA cohort as a whole. 17 Finally, as these data were collected over a large time period in a standardized fashion within the MCSA, we were limited in our ability to adjust for potential confounding variables that were not collected as a part of the participant intake process.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "In conclusion, this prospective, population-based study demonstrates associations between poorer audiometric performance and neuroimaging findings that overlap substantially with neuroimaging markers of CVD. These results therefore suggest a pathophysiologic link between hearing loss and CVD, potentially involving injury to white matter microstructure indicated in abnormal WMH and decreased FA of the corpus callosum, as well as decreased executive processing with depressed metabolic function in the anterior cingulate cortex. These changes exist within the complex network of neuroanatomic connectivity, and further study is required to delineate the underlying mechanism of hearing loss and its relationship with cognitive deterioration.",

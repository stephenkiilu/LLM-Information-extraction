    "abstract": "Background: Executive dysfunction is an early feature in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and may progress to a subcortical dementia. The mechanism of cognitive impairment is incompletely understood, and correlations with T2 lesion volumes are not strong. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may provide a better index of white matter tract damage. Previous DTI studies in CADASIL demonstrated abnormalities in normal-appearing white matter, thalamus, and putamen and correlations with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Objectives: To determine whether DTI abnormalities could be identified in nondemented patients with CADASIL and whether these correlated particularly strongly with executive function. Methods: Eighteen CADASIL subjects underwent DTI and cognitive assessment, including tests of several aspects of executive function. DTI was also performed on 12 age-matched control subjects. Results: Mean diffusivity was increased in white matter lesions, normalappearing white matter, and normal-appearing gray matter (thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus). A composite score of executive function correlated with diffusivity in both normal-appearing gray matter (r ϭ Ϫ0.73, p ϭ 0.002) and white matter (r ϭ Ϫ0.68, p ϭ 0.004). The strongest correlation for gray matter was for the thalamus (r ϭ Ϫ0.66, p ϭ 0.004); this remained after controlling for age, gender, and T2 lesion volumes. Correlations with MMSE were much weaker, and there was no correlation between T2 lesion volume and the executive function score (r ϭ Ϫ0.29, p ϭ 0.27). Conclusions: Abnormalities of normal-appearing white and deep gray matter are present in nondemented CADASIL patients, and these DTI measurements correlate particularly strongly with executive function.",

      "text": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal dominant arteriopathy characterized by recurrent lacunar stroke, migraine, and depression, 1,2 caused by mutations in the notch 3 gene. 3 A subcortical dementia develops in the majority of patients by the sixth or seventh decades. 1,2 Subtle cognitive abnormalities, particularly executive dysfunction, 5 arise earlier in the disease. 4 The mechanism of cognitive dysfunction is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is secondary to white matter tract damage and disconnection of cortical-cortical and cortical-subcortical connections; damage to striatocortical circuits linking the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas 6 may be responsible for the executive dysfunction. This could occur from leukoaraiosis and lacunar infarction seen on MRI. Studies in leukoaraiosis due to sporadic smallvessel disease have not shown strong correlations between T2 lesion load on MRI and cognitive function 7 ; similar studies in CADASIL have found modest correlations. 8 The weak correlation occurs because T2 high signal can be caused by varying degrees of damage from severe neuronal loss with disconnection or more subtle damage to glial or vascular tissues that leaves neural fibers intact. 9 An ideal technique would allow imaging of white matter tracts directly and provide quantitative measures of damage to tract structure.\nDiffusion tensor MRI (DTI) allows white matter tracts to be imaged in vivo 10 and provides measures of both diffusivity (a measure of the apparent diffusion coefficient averaged in all spatial directions) and fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of the directionality of diffusion. 11 Degeneration of white matter tracts would be expected to result in a reduction in FA owing to loss of directionality of diffusion, and an increase in mean diffusivity as the loss of myelin and axonal membranes would result in diffusion being less restricted in all directions.\nTwo previous studies have confirmed DTI is sensitive to white matter damage in CADASIL. 12,13 Diffusivity, both in regions of T2 hyperintensity 12 and in normal-appearing thalamus and putamen, correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. 14 The MMSE is a crude measure of cognitive functioning that is insensitive to executive dysfunction. DTI markers of damage in CADASIL might correlate more strongly with specific tests of executive function. If DTI is to be used clinically, it is important to demonstrate a correlation with cognition early in the disease, prior to the onset of dementia. Therefore, we determined the correlation between DTI measures and cognition, and in particular executive dysfunction, in nondemented subjects with CADASIL. MRI protocol. MRI was performed on a 1.5 T GE Signa MR scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI).\nConventional imaging. Axial fluid-attenuating inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1-weighted sequences were performed. Slice locations were identical for both sequences: Multiple contiguous 3-mm slices were prescribed in a true axial plane to provide complete brain coverage. In-plane resolution was 0.86 ϫ 0.86 mm; FLAIR: echo time (TE) 135 milliseconds, repetition time (TR) 9,500 milliseconds; T1 spin echo: TE 20 milliseconds, TR 450 milliseconds, no. of excitations 2. T1-weighted images were not obtained for two of the CADASIL subjects.\nDTI. A peripherally gated echo planar imaging sequence optimized for white matter was employed 15 with TE of 121.1 milliseconds, TR of 9, RR intervals on EKG, and maximum strength of diffusion gradients of 22 mT m Ϫ1 . In-plane resolution was 1.875 ϫ 1.875 mm. Fifteen to 18 near-axial 5-mm slices with 1-mm gap provided coverage of supratentorial structures in all subjects.\nMR image analysis.\nConventional MRI. Conventional images were displayed using Analyze (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). A semiautomated intensity-thresholding technique was used to measure lesion volume load on the FLAIR images.\nDTI. In addition to FA and mean diffusivity images, the DTI sequence produces T2-weighted images with identical slice characteristics. To ensure that the observer was not influenced by values of mean diffusivity or FA, regions of interest (ROI) were placed on the T2-weighted images. ROI were square and 3 ϫ 3 pixels in size (5.625 ϫ 5.625 mm) for the thalamus and white matter. In the putamen and globus pallidus, smaller ROI were used (2 ϫ 2 pixels, 3.75 ϫ 3.75 mm). To minimize partial volume effects, ROI were placed at least 2 mm (corresponding to at least 1 pixel width) from both the edge of the ventricles and the tissue boundaries demarcating abnormal from normal-appearing white matter. ROI were then superimposed in identical positions on mean diffusivity and FA maps, and mean values within them recorded.\nFor normal-appearing gray matter, a single slice was used at the upper border of the third ventricle. In the thalamus, up to three ROI were placed in each hemisphere; in the putamen, up to three ROI were positioned on each side; in the globus pallidus, up to two ROI on each side.\nTwo slices including the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles and two slices including the posterior horns were chosen for assessment of periventricular white matter. ROI were situated in three standard positions around each horn. ROI were included in subsequent analysis only if they were situated entirely within either normal-or abnormal-appearing white matter, at least 2 mm from a tissue boundary and within an imaginary line halfway between ventricle and cortical surface to prevent contamination with cortical gray matter. Two slices through the centrum semiovale were also chosen. For each slice, up to five ROI were placed in lesion white matter in each hemisphere, and similarly up to five ROI were placed widely through normal-appearing white matter in each hemisphere.\nFor each subject, a mean measurement was calculated for each anatomic area: anterior periventricular, posterior periventricular, and centrum semiovale. Separate mean measurements were generated for lesion and normal-appearing white matter. The number of ROI contributing to each measurement therefore varied depending on the severity and pattern of T2-weighted lesions. DTI metrics may vary in the normal brain at different anatomic sites.\nTo avoid any bias introduced by variations in the number of ROI from each anatomic site, the whole normal-appearing white matter measurements were generated by averaging the three mean measurements (anterior periventricular, posterior periventricular, centrum semiovale) rather than pooling all ROI. Reproducibility of measurements. The reproducibility of measurements made was assessed in a separate dataset of 10 subjects with leukoaraiosis. Measurements were made by a single rater using the techniques described above. The individual scans were then randomized and recoded, and the analysis was repeated by the same rater. The coefficients of variation for these measurements were as follows: T2-weighted lesion volume, 2.9; mean diffusivity of normal-appearing white matter, 1.0; anisotropy of normal-appearing white matter, 5.4; mean diffusivity within lesions, 8.1; anisotropy within lesions, 9.7.\nCognitive assessment. In all subjects, a cognitive battery was performed that included a number of tests sensitive to components of executive function: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Span Backwards is a test of working memory performance, 16 and Part B-A of the Trail Making Test assesses cognitive set shifting. 17 WAIS-R Digit Symbol also involves set shifting. 16 Memory performance was assessed with the Wechsler Memory Scale Paired Associate Learning Subtest. 18 For examining executive function tests, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons is inappropriate as measurements from different tests are not independent of each other. 19 When different measures are correlated in this way, a better approach is to perform a limited number of comparisons using composite measures. Therefore, a composite score (the first principal component) for executive dysfunction, the executive function score, was generated with principal components analysis. Scores for Digit Span Backwards, Trail Making B-A, and WAIS-R Digit Symbol were incorporated into this composite measure.\nResults. Imaging findings. Lesion volume on T2weighted imaging in the CADASIL group ranged from 2.1 to 139.5 cm 3 with a mean Ϯ SD of 48.4 Ϯ 45.6 cm 3 . White matter lesions in CADASIL patients showed both increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy compared with normal-appearing white matter (figure). In normalappearing white matter, similar, but less marked, abnormalities were found compared with white matter in the normal control subjects, with increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy (table 1). In all gray matter nuclei (table 2), diffusivity was increased in normal-appearing tissue and significant reductions in anisotropy were found in the right and left thalamus, but not in the putamen or globus pallidus. In these two structures, diffusion was relatively isotropic even in normal subjects.\nCorrelation between imaging and neuropsychological testing. There was no correlation between the executive function score and T2 lesion volume (r ϭ Ϫ0.29, p ϭ 0.27). In contrast, there were strong and significant correlations between the executive function score and DTI measures (table 3). Executive function correlated with diffusivity in both normal-appearing gray (r ϭ Ϫ0.73, p ϭ 0.002) and white (r ϭ Ϫ0.68, p ϭ 0.004) matter. The executive function score correlated with fractional anisotropy of normalappearing white matter (r ϭ 0.52, p ϭ 0.038), but not with that of normal-appearing gray matter (r ϭ 0.31, p ϭ 0.255). The strength of the correlation between the executive function score and diffusivity was similar for both the anterior and the posterior periventricular white matter (r ϭ Ϫ0.38, p ϭ 0.179 and r ϭ Ϫ0.48, p ϭ 0.062). There was no significant correlation between the executive function score and diffusivity or anisotropy within lesions (see table 3). Correlations were found between the executive function score and diffusivity of the thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus (r ϭ Ϫ0.71, Ϫ0.63, and Ϫ0.62; table 4). For anisotropy, significant correlations with the executive function score were present only for the thalamus (see table 4).\nIn contrast to the correlations found between DTI measures and executive function, no correlations were found between either diffusivity in the gray or white matter and memory performance (Verbal Paired Associate Learning), estimated Full-Scale IQ (mean diffusivity of normalappearing gray matter r ϭ Ϫ0.14, p ϭ 0.62; mean diffusivity of normal-appearing white matter r ϭ 0.17, p ϭ 0.52), or MMSE (mean diffusivity of normal-appearing gray matter r ϭ Ϫ0.11, p ϭ 0.58; mean diffusivity of normalappearing white matter r ϭ Ϫ0.15, p ϭ 0.58). A similar pattern was found with gray and white matter anisotropy, which did not correlate with memory performance, IQ, or MMSE.\nCorrelations between individual neuropsychological tests and DTI measures are shown in table 4. Individual tests of executive function correlated with diffusivity for most of the comparisons and were strongest for the thalamus. Correlations were also present between diffusivity of normal-appearing white matter in both the centrum semiovale and the periventricular regions and most individual tests of executive function. Correlations with anisotropy were generally weaker, and for the gray matter nuclei, there were significant correlations only for the thalamus.\nTo determine whether these correlations were independent of other MRI parameters, the relationship between the composite score of executive function and diffusivity of the thalamus was explored in more detail. Multiple linear regression was performed with age, gender, and lesion volume as covariates. The correlation with diffusivity of the thalamus remained significant (table 5).",

Mean diffusivity (left) and fractional anisotropy (right) images at the level of the thalamus in a control subject (top) and patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (bottom). In areas of abnormal white matter, increased mean diffusivity and reduced fractional anisotropy are clearly visible (arrows). Region-ofinterest analysis revealed more subtle abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter and the normal-appearing gray matter of the thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus.

      "text": "Discussion. This study demonstrates that DTI is sensitive to structural abnormalities in both the visibly damaged white matter and the normalappearing subcortical structures in patients with CADASIL. Abnormalities of normal-appearing tissue were found to involve all of the subcortical gray matter regions examined, including the thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus. Abnormalities were also found in the normal-appearing white matter. Importantly, these abnormalities correlated with cognitive function and, in particular, with executive dysfunction, which is a prominent feature of the disease. The strongest correlation with DTI measures was found for the thalamus, and mean diffusivity of the thalamus correlated with executive dysfunction independent of age and lesion load on T2-weighted images. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between T2 lesion load and cognition. Therefore, these findings are consistent with DTI being a better indi-cator of subcortical damage in CADASIL and potentially a more useful measure in monitoring disease progression. These findings support the conclusions of two previous DTI studies in CADASIL that have shown abnormalities in the thalamus, putamen, and normalappearing white matter and found some evidence for a correlation with cognitive performance. 12,13 This study extends the findings of previous studies in two ways. First, the results demonstrate that abnormalities of the normal-appearing white matter and deep gray matter nuclei are present in nondemented patients and may therefore emerge early in the disease course. Second, in these nondemented patients, DTI measures correlated with executive dysfunction, which characterizes the subtle, early phase of cognitive decline in CADASIL. These results suggest that DTI may be useful in monitoring disease progression early in the disease course, where therapeutic interventions are perhaps more likely to limit cognitive decline.\nChanges in the mean diffusivity of the thalamus could reflect either direct pathologic damage or secondary degeneration due to disruption of white matter tracts linking the thalamus to other structures. It has been argued that secondary degeneration was likely to be an important factor, as the rightleft ratio of mean diffusivity of the thalamus correlated with the corresponding ratio in the hemispheric white matter. 13 If secondary degeneration is an important factor, then mean diffusivity of the thalamus could be viewed as a marker of damage within a number of widely distributed neural circuits that relay in the thalamus. Thus, measurement of mean diffusivity within the thalamus may be a practical and reliable method of obtaining an index of damage within neural circuits that are crucial to executive processes. This technique could be implemented relatively simply without the need for sophisticated image analysis software.\nIn contrast to the associations between DTI mea- 12,13 have used the MMSE as a measure of cognitive performance. In the early stages of cognitive decline, the neuropsychological profile is likely to be narrow and selective, so that the MMSE is probably least useful at this stage. This makes the results of previous DTI studies difficult to extrapolate to a wider population of patients with CADASIL, as at least 30 of subjects in these studies had established dementia. The mechanism of executive dysfunction in CADASIL remains obscure. One possibility is that the striatocortical circuits that link the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas 6 are damaged by the disease process in CADASIL. These circuits are implicated in executive deficits in diseases such as Parkinson and Huntington diseases. 20 In contrast to these neurodegenerative diseases, where the pathology is confined to the gray matter of the basal ganglia, the striatocortical circuits could be damaged in CADASIL either within the deep gray matter nuclei or through disruption of the reciprocal white matter projections to the frontal cortex. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of this study as the striatocortical circuits relay in the thalamus, where the strongest correlations with executive function were found. Disruption of the striatocortical circuitry may also account for executive dysfunction in other white matter diseases. In many respects, CADASIL provides an ideal model to examine this hypothesis. A firm diagnosis can be made by genetic testing without the need for neuropathologic examination, and the disease is well established in early adulthood so that comorbidities are less likely to complicate interpretation of the results. Although CADASIL is a relatively rare condition, studies of the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction may provide valuable insights into similar mechanisms in common diseases like sporadic cerebral small-vessel disease.\nRelationships with cognitive function were weaker for anisotropy than mean diffusivity. This may be due to the relatively simple analysis techniques used. Diffusivity is relatively constant in white matter, whereas anisotropy values vary widely, depending upon whether the region is placed over the center of a white matter tract. The position of ROI relative to white matter tracts cannot be determined from the T2-weighted image on which the regions were placed. Therefore, small variations in the placement of ROI would lead to larger variations in FA than mean diffusivity, as reflected by the reproducibility analysis. With the implementation of more advanced analysis techniques and particularly techniques for highlighting specific tracts (tractography), 21 correlations with anisotropy are likely to be much stronger.\nProspective cohort studies are now required to determine whether similar correlations are present between changes in DTI parameters over time and decline on neuropsychological testing. A first study 22 has shown that changes in a median diffusivity measure derived from a diffusion histogram do correlate with changes in MMSE. Our data suggest that one might expect these correlations to be even stronger with tests of executive function, particularly if the method of analysis includes assessment of diffusivity and anisotropy in specific brain regions including the thalamus.",

    "abstract": "The formalin-fixed brain of a patient with clinically diagnosed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was examined post-mortem using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 3.0 T. Frontotemporal atrophy as well as bilateral frontal white matter abnormalities were seen. The white matter changes were slightly more extensive on DTI than on conventional MRI. Correlation with histopathology of the corresponding regions revealed typical frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type, with mild frontotemporal degeneration in the outer cortical layers and a moderate frontal white matter gliosis with demyelination. Postmortem MRIDTI with histopathologic correlation will enhance our understanding of the basis of white matter changes observed in dementia patients and may improve the in vivo MRIDTI diagnostic assessment in FTD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral grey as well as white matter pathology is recognized in histopathologically confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 123. The histopathological white matter pathology has been shown to appear in at least two different forms, each of which associating differently with the microscopical grey matter changes 3,4. The interpretation of white matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes may thus be difficult, and this may partly be due to additional pathologic alterations appearing in the interval between MRI and post-mortem histopathology.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a new MR technique for in vivo detection of white matter abnormalities, including subtle changes not visualized on conventional MRI 5. Comparison with histopathology is, however, necessary in order to validate the DTI findings. DTI performed post-mortem in FTD with subsequent histopathological correlation has, to our knowledge, not been reported previously.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate cerebral white matter changes in FTD using post-mortem MRI and DTI and to correlate the findings with histopathology. One purpose of the post-mortem strategy was to elimi-nate the time discrepancy between MRI and microscopical analysis and hence to enable precise matching between imaging and microscopy.",

      "text": "The brain of a 78-year-old patient with clinically diagnosed FTD was examined. After completed fixation in 6 formaldehyde solution, the entire brain was placed in a water container for MR examination. Special care was taken to eliminate air cavities and bubbles within the ventricles and on the surface of the brain. A 3.0-tesla MR scanner (Siemens Magnetom Allegra) was used to obtain conventional MRI T 1 -weighted spin echo, T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo, T 2weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T 1 -weighted 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared gradient echo in the coronal plane as well as diffusion images. Whole brain coverage was obtained for all sequences by acquiring 19 slices with a slice thickness of 5 mm. All scanning was performed at room temperature (approximately 22 C). A DTI protocol based on an echo planar imaging technique with diffusion sensitisation in six directions 6,7 and four different values of the diffusion sensitivity was used. An inversion pulse was added prior to the imaging sequence in order to reduce the signal from the surrounding water using a delay time of 2,500 ms. The diffusion sensitivity range was 0-800 smm 2 . In order to achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio for the diffusion-weighted images, scans were acquired using five averages, and this was repeated 13 times, giving a total number of repeated scans equal to 65 for each of the four diffusion sensitivity values and the six directions. The total scan time for the complete protocol was approximately 4 h. Maps displaying the trace of the diffusion tensor, i.e. the average apparent diffusion coefficient, the fractional anisotropy index 6 and a directional dependent map displaying the favoured direction of water diffusion were calculated. All calculations were made using an in-housedeveloped toolkit for diffusion analysis based on interactive data language (IDL  Research Systems Incorporated). Linear interpolation, using the four diffusion sensitivity values, was used for determination of the separate diffusion coefficients.\nAfter DTI, the brain was re-immersed in formaldehyde solution. It was later cut in centimeter-thick whole brain coronal slices, then sectioned and stained according to the diagnostic procedures in the laboratory. Whole brain sections were stained with haematoxylineosin for general morphology and with myelin staining Luxol Fast Blue. Sampled sections were stained with silver stainings and immunohistochemically with anti-tau and anti-glial stainings, for typing of the degenerative processes. Mapping of cortical and subcortical changes followed in the subsequent histopathologic analysis.",

In the frontal white matter, bilateral areas of diffusely delineated increased signal intensity were seen on T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo and FLAIR MR images (fig. 1).

The white matter pathology was confined to the frontal and temporal lobes and accentuated in the immediate subcortical zone (i.e. U-fibres), though extending through the deep white matter and reaching the periventricular zone. Anti-tau staining was negative.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In frontal lobe degeneration, histopathology shows frontotemporal cortical degeneration as well as white matter changes with demyelination and gliosis in areas subjacent to the most severely affected cortical regions 8. Diffuse increase in white matter signal intensity in the frontal andor temporal lobes on MRI has been reported in patients with the clinical diagnosis of FTD 2. In a previous study of 28 FTD patients compared with 76 normal controls, we found an MRI pattern with frontotemporal atrophy and predominantly frontal white matter changes in FTD, correlating with the histopathological findings at neuropathological examination, which was performed in 6 of these FTD patients 4.\nPost-mortem MRI of formalin-fixed brain specimens with correlation with histopathology has been reported by several authors and the findings on post-mortem MRI were comparable with those obtained on pre-mortem MRI in most of the studies 9,10. However, the formalin fixation affects the MR relaxation times of the brain tissue and thereby the grey-white matter contrast in the images 11. In a post-mortem study of 6 patients with Alzheimers disease, histopathology showed significantly more extensive changes than did MRI 12. The new MR technique DTI may provide more information on tissue integrity by mapping the diffusion of tissue water in different directions 5. DTI is therefore a promising tool for non-invasive investigation of the extent and nature of white matter damage of dementia patients in vivo 13.\nIn the present study, we have shown that post-mortem DTI at 3.0 T of a formalin-fixed whole human brain is feasible, and that the white matter changes seen on MRI and DTI in this FTD brain corresponded to gliosis with LarssonEnglundSjöbeckLättBrockstedt demyelination on histopathologic analysis. In a recent report, comparing DTI at 4.7 T of mouse brain in vivo and ex vivo after fixation, the directional diffusion was reduced proportionally for all directions 14. This suggests that the tissue architecture may be preserved after fixation in formaldehyde solution and thereby can be evaluated by DTI. In another study, DTI at 1.5 T of fresh and formalin-fixed human brain slices was performed post-mortem in 10 patients with multiple sclerosis and 1 patient with a clinical history of dementia 15. The mean diffusivity was found to be reduced in the fresh brain slices compared with values generally measured in vivo and it was further reduced after formalin fixation. However, the fractional anisotropy, which is a measure of the directional diffusion, seemed to be preserved after fixation.\nThe higher magnetic field strength of 3.0 T used in our study has advantages for post-mortem DTI compared with the clinically more used field strength 1.5 T. The slower diffusion at room temperature compared with that of body temperature yields a lower signal drop for the diffusion sensitized images, which is why the inherent increase in the signal-to-noise ratio with increased field strength is beneficial for detection of small differences in MR signal. In addition, the combination of the high signal-to-noise ratio at 3.0 T with the strong gradients of our MR scanner allows optimization of the DTI scanning protocol. In this case study, DTI seemed to be more sensitive than MRI for the detection of white matter abnormalities, also post-mortem. Correlation with histopathology in corresponding regions of the brain with this approach eliminates the risk of artefactual pathology due to intercurrent events. It may enable a diagnostic subtyping of white matter pathology in FTD and other dementing conditions and may thus potentially improve the in vivo MRIDTI diagnostic assessment in FTD.",

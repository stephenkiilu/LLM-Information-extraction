    "abstract": "Aging is associated with decline in white matter (WM) microstructure, decreased cognitive functioning, and increased risk of Alzheimers disease and related dementias. Recent research has identified aerobic physical exercise as a promising intervention for increasing white matter microstructure in aging, with the aim of increasing cognitive abilities, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes. However, the degree to which white matter microstructure can be protected or improved with exercise remains incompletely understood. Here, a sub-group of 25 healthy, sedentary participants (aged 57 to 86 years; M  67.1; SD  7.9; 11 female, 14 male) from the larger Brain in Motion Study (Tyndall et al., 2013) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and after a six-month aerobic exercise intervention. DTI data were analysed with FSLs Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to determine whether WM microstructure improved, as defined by increased fractional anisotropy (FA) andor decreased mean diffusivity (MD), after the aerobic exercise intervention. Neither FA nor MD of the cerebral WM were significantly correlated with either age or cardiovascular fitness at baseline. Whole-brain WM mean FA decreased over the intervention while mean MD showed no significant change. Longitudinal TBSS analyses revealed decreased FA in the left uncinate fasciculus, left anterior corona radiata, left inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation. MD increased in the left forceps major, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Results indicate that six months of aerobic exercise in healthy, sedentary older adults was not associated with improvements in FA or MD measures of cerebral WM microstructure.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Normal aging is associated with macro-and microstructural brain changes affecting both grey (GM) and white matter (WM; 2). While GM has long been thought to play the dominant role in human cognitive functioning, this corticocentric myopia 3 has been challenged in recent years by findings that strongly implicate WM as an equally critical determinant of neurobehavioral effects. This is perhaps not surprising given the essential role that WM plays in mediating connectivity between GM regions, working with information processing areas to organize and allow for the extraordinary range of all possible human behaviours 4.\nAge-related declines in WM microstructure have been found to disrupt neural communication and are associated with deterioration in cognitive functioning and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and related dementias 2. Older adults have been found to be particularly vulnerable to microstructural degradation in anterior WM tracts, which appear to impact cognitive functions subserved by frontal regions (e.g. executive functioning, processing speed, memory) 4,5. Filley and Fields 2 discuss the myelin model of AD where the amyloid and tau protein deposition traditionally thought to precipitate the cognitive and behavioural symptoms of AD are considered neurologically adaptive downstream effects of initial WM damage 6,7. Vascular risk factors due to the https:doi.org10.1016j.bbr.2019.112042 Received 29 January 2019; Received in revised form 6 June 2019; Accepted 14 June 2019 selective atherosclerotic vulnerability of the small penetrating arterioles, which irrigate cerebral WM, is thought to, at least partially, lead to the initial damage to WM architecture 8. This underscores the potential of preventative interventions for the maintenance of healthy WM and cognitive functioning in normally aging older adults (see 9).\nRecent research has identified physical exercise, and particularly aerobic exercise, as a promising method of preventing or even reversing changes in neural structure or function in the aging brain 4. Randomized controlled trials using 6-12 month aerobic exercise interventions were found to improve GM structure and function in older adulthood and even improve some aspects of cognition ( 10,11; Erickson et al., 2011). Substantially less is known about the impact of aerobic exercise on WM structure and function in the aging brain. The extant literature has linked aerobic physical activity to the preservation of WM into old age via cross-sectional and longitudinal studies 12,13. However, many previous studies of aerobic exercise, WM microstructure, and cognitive functioning have been methodologically limited by small sample sizes, self-reported metrics of physical activity that are prone to desirability biases, or failure to link changes in WM structure to consequent cognitive outcomes 4. A recent systematic review 14 cites only one study that investigated the longitudinal impact of aerobic fitness training on WM microstructure and cognition ( 15; but see 16). Results indicated improvements in WM microstructure, though there was no main effect of group (aerobic exercise versus non-aerobic exercise control) or consequent improvements on psychometric measures of cognition post-intervention. However, as the authors note, these findings were equivocal with previous literature and subsequent reviews have called for replication studies due to the small sample size, and reliance on subjective (i.e. questionnaire) measures of physical fitness and activity ( 4; Filley  Field, 2016;17).\nThe present study investigated WM microstructure in a subset of healthy, sedentary participants from the larger Brain in Motion Study, which is a six-month aerobic exercise intervention in a group of 264 healthy community-dwelling middle aged to older adults 1. Specifically, we sought to determine whether cardiovascular fitness is associated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of WM microstructure (i.e. fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) before exercise intervention in this subset. A secondary objective was to examine the extent to which the six-month aerobic exercise intervention was associated with improvement in these DTI metrics of WM microstructure. We hypothesized that greater aerobic fitness would be associated with greater white matter microstructure at baseline, and the sixmonth aerobic exercise intervention would positively influence measures of WM microstructure, defined as increases in FA and decreases in MD.",

      "text": "A total of 25 healthy, sedentary adults between the ages of 57 and 86 (M  67.1; SD  7.9; 11 female, 14 male) from the larger Brain in Motion Study (protocol was approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board; 1) consented to participate in this MRI sub-study. Table 1 lists demographic characteristics, as well as cognitive screening scores, and physiological variablesboth before and after the intervention. Data for all participants with complete data from the larger Brain in Motion sample are also included in Table 1 for comparison.\nParticipants underwent a six-month aerobic exercise intervention consisting of three weekly exercise sessions at pre-specified intensities and durations. Participants were also encouraged to complete one additional weekly exercise session on their own. Exercise intensity was tracked with Polar heart rate monitors and increased in intensity from 30 to 45 heart rate reserve (HRR; the difference between resting and maximum heart rates achieved during a maximal oxygen consumption (EQ O(V,sup9(.))O 2max ) test) at the start of the intervention to 60-70 by the end. Target exercise duration was increased from 20 min to 45 min over the course of the 6-month intervention.\nAll participants were assessed before and after exercise with a variety of physiological, psychological, and cognitive tests, including: blood work, genetics, maximal aerobic capacity (i.e. EQ O(V,s up9(.))O 2max test), cerebrovascular functioning, and neuropsychological functioning. Participants also responded to surveys regarding mood, sleep behaviour, physical activity history, dietary history, and social support as previously detailed 1. Regarding the EQ O(V,s up9(.))O 2max test specifically, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was determined using a metabolic cart (Parvo Medics TruOne 2400). Ventilatory volumes and expiratory gases were measured during a ramp exercise test on a programmable motorized treadmill (Quinton TM55). Baseline measures were obtained during a three-minute period of quiet standing on the treadmill. Warm-up measures were obtained during a four-minute slow walk speed of 1.7 mph and grade at 0. Following the warm up period, a combination of small increases in velocity and grade every 30 s were used to elicit a ramp-like test according to previously described methods 18. Participants exercised to volitional fatigue or until the presence of symptoms consistent with the American College of Sports Medicines (ACSM) Indications for Terminating a Symptom-Limited Maximal Exercise Test 19. Participants were verbally encouraged throughout the test. Recovery measures were obtained for five minutes following the test at a speed of 1.7 mph and grade at 0. Heart rate was measured manually at rest at the wrist and during exercise using a heart rate monitor and chest strap (Polar Electro Oy). A 12-lead electrocardiogram system (Q-stress) monitored heart rhythms at rest (5 min) prior to, during, and post exercise (3 min). Exercising heart rate, blood pressure (manual brachial measurement), and the participants rating of perceived exertion (RPE) value were measured every two minutes during exercise. Peak heart rate and blood pressure values were recorded at maximal effort. VO2peak was determined from as the highest 30-second average value during the exercise test. Ventilatory thresholds were determined and verified by two independent investigators according to the V-slope method 20. Participants in the current study were a subset that agreed to participate in MRI scanning sessions both before and after the exercise intervention with no contraindications to MRI.\nMRI scans were completed on a 3 T General Electric Discovery 750 system, with a 12-channel receive-only head coil. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired to assess WM microstructure using the following parameters: TRTE  800060 ms, 110  110 matrix, 80 axial slices, 2.2mm 3 voxel size, three b-value  0 images, and 30 diffusionweighted images with b-value  1000, SENSE (ASSET) factor 2 acceleration in the phase encoding direction. Analyses of DTI images were performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS; 21), Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) version 3.0, and other utilities from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL 22;) version 5.0.10 for macOS.\nImages were first visually inspected for quality using OsiriX Lite version 8.5.2. No scans were excluded on the basis of poor scan quality upon initial inspection. Following this, data were preprocessed using a standard procedure including: 1) motion and eddy current correction via FSLs EDDYa tool designed to remediate eddy current-induced distortions and participant movement 23; 2) fitting of diffusion tensors with FSLs DTIFIT tool.\nFollowing data preprocessing, we used FSLs TBSS to produce an average WM skeleton (i.e. representation of major WM tracts) for all participants before and after exercise intervention by a standard procedure including: 1) automated removal of brain-edge artefacts in participants FA data 2) nonlinear registration of each participants FA data to the FMRIB58_FA template with FMRIBs non-linear registration tool (FNIRT); 3) application of these registrations to take each participants FA data into MNI152 1  1x1 standard space; 4) binarizing the identified mean FA skeleton at a threshold of 0.3 (a cut-off of 0.2 was also trialed, with no impact on contrasts of interest); 5) projecting each participants FA data on to the skeleton; and 6) conducting withinsubject (i.e. pre-exercise vs. post-exercise) voxelwise statistics using FSLs randomise tool ( 24; a permutation based-method well-suited for applications where the null distribution is unknown) with 5000 permutations per contrast. Our model specifically tested two contrasts of interest: where pre-exercise FA is greater than post-exercise FA, and conversely, where post-exercise FA is greater than pre-exercise FA. Salient covariates such as age, sex, education, physical fitness, and general intellectual ability were not included in our model, as each participant acts as their own control for each of these variables in the current within-subject longitudinal design. The result of this procedure is a statistical map in the shape of the mean FA skeleton representing the voxel-by-voxel probability that group mean FA values differ between pre-and post-exercise. These resulting maps were then thresholded at 0.05 to evaluate statistical significance. The procedure from step five onward was repeated with MD values, which yielded separate statistical maps of areas of significant change in MD values across the whole brain WM skeleton. Mean FA and MD values in the WM skeleton pre-and post-exercise were exported to SPSS for correlational comparisons with VO 2 max, participant age, as well as longitudinal analysis via paired samples t-tests.",

      "text": "Our analyses revealed no correlation between whole brain (i.e. throughout the entire WM skeleton) DTI metrics of WM microstructure and EQ O(V,sup9(.))O 2max prior to the start of the exercise intervention (FA: r  -0.11, p  .61; MD: r  -0.07, p  .74). We also found no significant correlation between these DTI metrics and participant age (FA: r  -0.03, p  .87; MD: r  0.31, p  .14). Participant age and VO 2 max were correlated: (r  -0.66, p  .001), and participants improved on an objective measure of fitness from pre-to post-exercise testing; that is, group average EQ O(V,sup9(.))O 2max measurements improved from 26.59 to 28.66 mlkgmin (t (24)  -5.16, p  .001, d  3.24).\nComparison of pre-and post-exercise whole-brain FA and MD revealed that FA decreased (t (24)  2.08, p  .049, d  -.42) following exercise training while there was no change in MD (t (24)  -1.55, p  .13, d  .32). The decreases in FA observed in our sample represent a change of approximately -0.45 (pre-intervention mean FA  0.439; post-intervention mean FA  0.437). This is roughly in line with results from Storsve et al. 25 who noted non-uniform percentage decreases in white matter integrity across the lifespan ranging from 0.2 in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, to 0.65 in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, in their sample ranging in age from 23 to 87 years. Furthermore, the percent change in FA and MD across the intervention period in our sample was not correlated with the percent change in EQ O(V,s up9(.))O 2max (FA: r  0.03, p  .87; MD: r  -0.14, p  .52). Scatterplots depicting these correlations are presented in Figs. 3 and4.\nConsistent with the above findings, our longitudinal TBSS analysis revealed no significant clusters within the WM skeleton with greater FA after exercise compared to before. Several areas were identified as having decreased FA following the exercise intervention, including areas of the left uncinate fasciculus, left anterior corona radiata, left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation (Fig. 1). TBSS analyses revealed no region-specific decreases in MD across the intervention period. Increases in MD specific to areas of the left forceps major, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus were found (Fig. 2). Details of significant clusters for FA are presented in Table 2, and details of significant clusters for MD are presented in Table 3. Additional data pertaining to measures of radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity are reported in the supplementary materials.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Contrary to our hypotheses, the exercise intervention was not associated with measurable improvement of either FA or MD. Rather, we observed declines in whole-brain WM mean FA across the intervention period, and no change in whole-brain WM mean MD. TBSS analyses revealed decreases from pre-to post-exercise in FA within several brain regions (left uncinate fasciculus, left anterior corona radiata, left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation) and increases in MD within other ones (left forceps major, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus).\nThese findings are consistent with those from the limited number of published studies that have investigated WM microstructure in relation to cardiovascular fitness cross-sectionally. Sexton and colleagues (2016) summarized this literature and noted that only three of seven studies found significant associations between FA and measures of cardiovascular fitness 262728. Two of the three positive studies relied on questionnaires to assess physical activity level versus objective testing measures of aerobic fitness 27,28. Of three cross-sectional studies that have reported on the link between MD and physical activity only one reported results consistent with a reliable association between WM, MD and physical activity, as assessed via questionnaire 28.\nOur findings are also consistent with the few longitudinal studies that have investigated WM microstructure (via DTI metrics including FA and MD) before and after an aerobic exercise intervention. Voss and colleagues (2013) found no significant differences in FA between an aerobic exercise (i.e. walking) group versus a flexibility, toning, and balance control condition following a 12-month intervention period. Note: voxels indicates number of voxels in the cluster; Max. indicates maximum z-statistic in the cluster; Max. XYZ indicates coordinates (in mm) of the maximum z-statistic; COG XYZ indicates the coordinates (in mm) of the center of gravity (i.e. weighted average of coordinates and intensities) of the cluster.",

      "text": "Clusters showing significantly less mean diffusivity pre-vs. post-intervention. Voss and colleagues reported a significant positive correlation between percent change in fitness and percent change in FA in prefrontal and temporal regions in the walking group but not the flexibilitytoning balance control group. In contrast, we found no association between fitness gains and improvements in FA or MD, over the course of our sixmonth aerobic exercise intervention. Rather, our results appear to reflect the minor age-related decrements in WM microstructure that occur normatively with age 2. Consistent with this, Burzynska and colleagues (2017) reported significant declines in WM integrity across the majority of brain regions in a six-month randomized trial, regardless of intervention group (dance; walking; walking and nutrition; stretching and toning active control) in a large sample (N  174) of healthy but low-active older adults. However, our present results add meaningfully to the literature by first confirming the effect of aerobic exercise intervention by objective fitness measurement (i.e. VO 2 max), before seeking to assess its hypothesized impact on supposed downstream consequents, like WM microstructure. Though we saw no improvements in WM microstructure following the exercise intervention, our findings do not conclusively prove that aerobic exercise is ineffective in maintaining or improving WM microstructure. As our sample size was small, our study was arguably underpowered to show a modest benefit. For example, we did not show the expected significant correlations between participant age and FA MD, which is a robust finding from the literature. The absence of this association in our sample points to the need for a larger study population, a larger age range, andor a stronger DTI scanning protocol (e.g. two phase encoding directions, or longer total scan duration). It is also possible that any benefits that may occur from six-months of aerobic exercise training are not reliably measurable by DTI metrics or our present methodology, may take more than six months of training to become evident 29, or may only accrue over any timeframe in participants of lesser cardiovascular fitness than those in the present sample. In terms of the imaging methods used, DTI is a sensitive, but not specific marker of microstructural changes 30. For example, degeneration of one white matter tract in areas of crossing fibres has been shown to be associated with paradoxical FA increases 31. Finally, the absence of a control group in the current study design impedes our ability to comment on whether or not the exercise intervention had a beneficial effect on cerebral WM, regardless of the counteracting negative effects of normal aging.\nFuture research in this area should seek to overcome these limitations in order to disentangle the associations between physical fitness, aerobic exercise intervention, and DTI measures of WM microstructure in aging. Knowing if, and to what degree, physical fitness and aerobic exercise might be protective against WM degeneration in the normal aging brain holds considerable import in the continued search for ways to prevent or ameliorate AD and related dementias.",

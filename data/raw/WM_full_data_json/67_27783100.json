    "abstract": "Introduction Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have usually been found cognitive impairment associated with brain white matter (WM) abnormalities. However, findings have varied across studies, and any potential relationship with Alzheimers disease (AD) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the whole-brain WM integrity of T2DM patients and to compare our findings with those of published AD cases. Methods In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) combined with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate whole-brain WM abnormalities in 48 T2DM patients and 48 healthy controls. The effects of age and gender were also evaluated. Results In our study, significantly decreasing FA and increasing MD and DA values (P0.05) were found in some WM regions closely related to the default mode network (DMN), including cingulum, the right frontal lobe involving the right uncinate fasciculus (UF), bilateral parietal lobes involving the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) involving the UF and the ILF. We also found abnormalities in the thalamus involving the fornix (FX), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), and posterior thalamic radiation (PTR). The damaged regions above are similar to those found in patients with AD, as reported in previous studies. Conclusion The present study not only provides useful information about the WM regions and tracts affected by T2DM but also offers insight into the underlying neuropathological process in T2DM patients and the relationship between T2DM and AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia, which has been shown to be associated with neurological disorder, including impaired visual construction, planning, visual memory, and cognitive speed 1. Incomplete understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism hampers the development of preventive treatments. Previous neuroimaging findings revealed that early changes in the brains of T2DM patients often have an increased risk of dementia 2. However, the abnormal brain regions revealed in the previous results were not all the same and varied across studies. Additionally, the potential relationship between T2DM and Alzheimers disease (AD) remains largely unclear.\nSubtle abnormalities could not be detected by conventional structural MRI due to the insufficient sensitivity, but could be investigated by DTI 3. DTI is a non-invasive MRI tool that can investigate WM integrity in vivo and measure macroscopic axonal organization in the central nervous system 4. Several DTI parameters appear to correlate with microstructural characteristics. These parameters include fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (RD), which can quantify the degree of constrained water diffusion along the axons and myelin. Decreased FA and increased MD values indicate a loss of WM integrity 5. Increased DA values are more closely related to axonal injury, and RD may be modulated more directly by myelin alterations 6. Therefore, DA and RD values provide more detailed information about the underlying microstructural tissue organization.\nPrevious DTI studies have revealed abnormal brain regions in T2DM patients, but the results have varied across studies. Falvey CM et al. 5 reported that type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced FA for total WM and greater MD values for the limbic system regions, such as the hippocampus and left posterior cingulated cortex, and other regions such as the prefrontal cortex and right putamen on micro-structural measures. Jung-Lung Hsu et al. 7 showed that a significantly decreased FA in the bilateral frontal WM compared to controls was mainly caused by an increased RD and not a decreased DA values within these regions. To assess the WM integrity of T2DM patients, TBSS, a whole-brain voxelwise analysis method that does not use spatial smoothing 8 is used. It can automatically analyze whole-brain WM integrity and can provide more reliable alignment imaging of WM tracts 9,10. We believe that DTI combined with TBSS can provide more credible results.\nT2DM has been reported to be a risk factor for AD and may increase its morbidity by 50-100  11,12, but few studies have compared WM properties or impairments in these two diseases. Previous studies showed changes in DTI parameters in some brain regions. Phillips OR et al. 13 found an overall increase in DA and RD values across most of the superficial WM integrity, especially the bilateral parahippocampal regions and the temporal and frontal lobes. Tang X et al. 14 showed that the whole-brain structural integrity displayed a significantly decreased FA value and an increased MD value in AD. Zhu Q et al. 15 reported that significant differences for all indices in the FX and significantly decreased FA and increased MD and RD in the bilateral UF. The potential relationship between T2DM and AD is still controversial.\nIn this work, we used DTI combing with TBSS to investigate whole-brain WM changes in each T2DM patient in this study. We also evaluated the WM abnormalities in the brains of T2DM patients and to compare our findings with those of published AD cases, in order to learn more about the mechanism of mental disorders in T2DM patients and the potential relationship between T2DM and AD.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "We enrolled 96 participants (48 T2DM patients and 48 healthy control subjects) for total. Informed consent was also obtained from each participant. The diagnosis of T2DM is based on the standard criteria: HbA 1c  6.5  (48 mmolmol), fasting blood glucose (FDG)  7.0 mmolL (126 mgdL), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h postprandial blood glucos  1.1 mmolL (200 mgdL), and symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crises and random blood glucose  11.1 mmolL (200 mgdL); without symptoms of hyperglycemia, the standard of 1 to 3 items should be reviewed. The neurologists performed physical and neurological examinations (such as checking the cranial nerves, the motor system, and any cerebellar signs) for all participants. Control participants were matched with T2DM patients with respect to age and sex. Exclusion criteria for all participants included an indication of dementia (evaluated by the psychologists); a history of psychic diseases; physical signs of impairment of cognitive function; a history of stroke, epilepsy, head trauma, or brain surgery; a history of organic lesions in the brain, cerebrovascular accidents; severe liver, kidney, or heart disease; TIA attack in the past 2 years; alcohol or tobacco abuse; hypertension and hyperlipemia; and contraindications to MRI. There should be no specific abnormalities of conventional MR scans. Moreover, T2DM patients should not have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, acute metabolic complications of diabetes and severe hypoglycemia, or a history of ketoacidosis. Control participants were excluded if they had a FDG level  7.0 mmolL; OGTT 2 h postprandial blood glucos 7.8 mmolL.",

      "text": "Images were first converted from DICOM format into ANALYZE. DTI-TBSS data were analyzed using FSL tools (FMRIB Software Library, www.firirib.ox.ac.ukfsl, version 4. 19). The main procedure of DTI was conducted as follows: first, head movement and eddy current distortion were corrected using affine registration in Eddy Current Correction (FSL tool) ( Oxford University). Second, a mask image was created from each subjects B0 image. After completing these preprocesses, DTI parameters, including FA, MD, DA, and RD values, were calculated on a voxelby-voxel basis by using DTIFit (FMRIB Software Librarys Diffusion Toolbox) (Oxford University).\nTBSS processes performed a multi-subject analysis of FA, MD, DA, and RD values. First, a target image was determined by aligning the images from all subjects to determine an FA standard template. Second, this target image was normalized to the MNI152 standard space using an affine transformation. All other subjects were then aligned first to the target image and then to a 1  1  1 mm MNI152 space with nonlinear registration implemented with FNIRT (FSL tool). A mean FA skeleton was then created and represented the centers of all tracts common to the group. Fourth, all individual participants aligned FA maps were projected onto the FA skeleton. The resultant skeletonized FA maps were then fed into a voxelwise group-level analysis. Last, differences in DTI parameters between groups were analyzed with the FSL function Brandomize,using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). This method does not require a minimum cluster size to be defined a priori. Family wise error (FWE) would occurred in multiple comparisons, and we used non-parametric permutation testing (5000 permutations) for correction. In addition to FA, diffusivity maps based on MD, DA, and RD were generated by using the same steps outlined above.",

This present study found significant decreased FA, increased MD and DA values in several WM regions and tracts between T2DM patients and healthy controls, indicated a loss of WM integrity and axonal injury. These regions are closely related to those within the DMN. WM abnormalities were also found in the thalamus. This region is mainly associated with cognitive impairment. The range of abnormalities indicates that though the conventional MRI showed no specific lesions, the regional damage could affect one or more other brain regions and tracts. Furthermore, some of the abnormal regions and tracts found were similar to those observed in AD patients, raising the possibility of a potential relationship between the disease and the brain abnormalities found in this study.",

    "White matter regions closely related to DMN": {
      "text": "DMN is a functional network. Previous functional studies showed that the DMN was abnormal in T2DM patients 17.\nThe DMN is the brain system involved in constructing selfrelevant mental simulation, such as remembering the past, thinking about the future, and understanding the current viewpoint of others 18,19. It mainly encompasses the cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, angular gyrus, and inferior parietal lobe. DMN changes could predict treatment response in patients with mental disorders. Additionally, the MTG is a critical node within the DMN. It plays a vital role in verbal functions such as verbal fluency, language processing, and speech production 20.\nIn our structural study, we found micro-structural abnormalities in the MTG involving the UF and the ILF, and other brain regions similar to those within the DMN, including the cingulum, the right frontal lobe involving the right UF, and the bilateral parietal lobes involving the SLF and the ILF. The cingulum involves limbic WM bundles that contain afferent and efferent connections to and from the hippocampus. The UF is considered part of the limbic system 21 and plays an important role in the formation and retrieval of episodic memories 22. The ILF is involved in the visual memory 23. Therefore, we believe that both functional and structural abnormalities exist in brain regions related to the DMN. abnormalities may lead to impairment of various cognitive and social processing domains in T2DM patients, such as memory, information processing speed, attention, and executive function 17. Therefore, these regions, especially the MTG, may provide prognostic information for T2DM-associated cognitive decline.",

    "White matter abnormalities in the thalamus": {
      "text": "The thalamus is the location where neural fibers assemble and link to various brain regions. Accordingly, the thalamus has been referred to as the gateway for nearly all sensory inputs to their corresponding cortical areas. The thalamus plays an important role in the Papez circuit through its structural connectivity with the medial temporal lobe and is considered to be associated with memory, learning, information processing and integration across neural circuits for successful cognition 24. Therefore, patients may present with various forms of cognitive impairment when changes occur in the thalamus. In fact, some previous studies found alteration of thalamic sub-regions projecting to the temporal lobes in patients with dementia. Damoiseaux et al. 25 observed an impaired connection between the thalamus and the medial temporal cortex in AD patients using DTI. Zarei et al. 26 showed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the thalamus in AD patients and demonstrated that the thalamus was mainly connected with the hippocampus, temporal, and prefrontal cortex. Delli Pizzi et al. 27,28 reported that AD patients showed bilateral alteration within thalamic region projecting to temporal cortex. Yu-Chen Chen et al. 29 revealed that T2DM patients develop disrupted thalamocortical functional connectivity, which is associated with cognitive impairment.\nAnd in our current structural study, we also found WM abnormalities in the thalamus involving the FX, ATR, and PTR. The FX carries signals from the anterior thalamus to the temporal cortex and plays a key role in memory and cognitive function. The ATR has connections to the frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortices and were associated with executive processes and memory. Furthermore, the PTR structurally connects the parietal and occipital lobes and has importance in overall cognitive control and interference suppression. Therefore, we suggest that the structure of the thalamus (especially the FX) may be important as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for identifying cognitive decrement in T2DM patients and recommend further study of the mechanism of mental disorders in T2DM patients.\nRelationship with Alzheimers disease AD is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions. Several epidemiological studies have shown that T2DM is a risk factor for AD 30,31, which initially manifests as deficits in abstraction, problem solving, memory, and the completion of tasks involving speed and complex perceptual-motor responses 32. Biessels GJ et al. 33 conducted a systematic review of 14 longitudinal studies and reported that diabetes mellitus increased the risks for both AD and vascular dementia. The relationship between T2DM and AD is still under debate.\nIn the study, the damaged regions mentioned in the result were similar to those found in patients with AD, as reported in previous brain structural studies. These regions mainly included those related to the DMN (especially MTG and the cingulum) and the thalamus. ODwyer L et al. 34 proposed that neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease might begin in the temporal lobe, cingulum, and prefrontal regions. Yan WZ et al. 35 found a gray matter volume decrease in the left MTG, reporting that the MTG presents Alzheimers disease pathology significantly earlier than other brain regions, according to the previous study 36. de Oliveira et al. 37 found a stepwise decline in thalamic status going from controls to Alzheimers disease cases. de Jong et al. 38 reported reduced thalamic volume in Alzheimers disease patients. Zhu QY et al. 39 used DTI analyses and indicated that thalamic connectivity was progressively disrupted in patients with AD, and the FX might be important as a potential marker for the early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring disease progression. Therefore, we believe the potential relationship between T2DM and AD may exist. We suggest that brain regions related DMN and the thalamus may be important regions for further study to better understand the distinction and potential relationship between T2DM and AD.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "The current study has several limitations. First, there was a lack of a deep neuropsychological evaluation. However, we had a series of exclusion criteria to exclude participants who had an indication of physical and mental disorders. Neurocognitive assessment should be studied further to better understand the mechanism of mental disorders in T2DM patients. To that end, we will also cooperate with an organization that conducts psychological evaluations. Another limitation was the relatively small sample size in the current study may have reduced our ability to detect WM changes. Therefore, future studies with larger samples sizes may be needed. As the T2DM patients in our study had received medications that may affect brain microstructures, which may affect the reliability of our study results, further studies should include medication-naive subjects to rule out this possible bias.",

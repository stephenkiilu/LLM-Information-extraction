    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We investigated the associations of leptin markers with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and vascular injury in healthy middle-aged adults. METHODS: We included 2262 cognitively healthy participants from the Framingham Heart Study with neuropsychological evaluation; of these, 2028 also had available brain MRI. Concentrations of leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and their ratio (free leptin index FLI), indicating leptin bioavailability, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cognitive and MRI measures were derived using standardized protocols. RESULTS: Higher sOB-R was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA, β  -0.114  0.02, p  0.001), and higher free water (FW, β  0.091  0.022, p  0.001) and peak-width skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD, β  0.078  0.021, p  0.001). Correspondingly, higher FLI was associated with higher FA (β  0.115  0.027, p  0.001) and lower FW (β  -0.096  0.029, p  0.001) and PSMD (β  -0.085  0.028, p  0.002).",

    "BACKGROUND": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide. 1 Accruing epidemiological evidence suggests that midlife obesity is an important contributor to the risk of developing AD. 2 This has created a growing interest in disentangling the mechanisms linking obesity to AD, which potentially extend through vascular, 3 genetic, 4 and metabolic pathways. 5 The study of adipose tissue has led to significant insights. Once viewed as a passive reservoir for energy storage, adipose tissue is now considered a part of the endocrine system, secreting a group of bioactive peptides, known as adipokines, that exert pleiotropic autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects in the periphery as well as the central nervous system. 6 Leptin, a cardinal adipokine responsible for central control of food intake and energy homeostasis, has been implicated in a variety of neurophysiological functions, including brain development, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. 7 Due to these effects, it has been considered a plausible mechanistic intermediary in the pathway leading from obesity to AD. This hypothesis has been substantiated by findings relating higher leptin levels to lower risk for incident AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 8,9 as well as better structural brain indices in older adults. 8 However, studies conducted in younger individuals have not detected associations between leptin and late-life dementia risk or AD endophenotypes, such as neuropsychological test scores or brain volume measures. 10,11 Given the long latency period between the onset of pathological changes in the brain and the manifestation of clinical symptoms that characterize AD, 12 these incongruent findings could indicate that decreased leptin levels might actually represent a consequence rather than a cause of AD-related pathobiological processes.\nThis highlights the importance of studying the associations of lep-tin markers with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes in younger individuals, who are less likely to have accumulated AD pathology.\nImportant to consider is also the fact that in certain individuals, particularly those who are obese, high levels of circulating leptin might be linked to the development of central leptin resistance, ultimately reflecting a state of relative leptin deficiency from a brain-signaling standpoint. 13 Measuring the free leptin index (FLI) has been proposed as a way to account for leptin resistance and reflect leptin bioavailability 141516 ; therefore, FLI might be more sensitive than circulating leptin levels to capture potential relationships between leptin signaling states and health-related outcomes.\nIn the present study, we aimed to gain further insights into the potential relationships of leptin with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden. To this end, we investigated the associations of leptin, its soluble receptor, and leptin bioavailability with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in cognitively healthy, community-dwelling middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We further sought replication in a diverse cohort of the MarkVCID study.",

Total brain, cortical gray matter, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were derived using standard protocols. 19 Total cranial volume (TCV) was determined using a convolutional neural network method. 20 Volumetric measures were divided by TCV to correct for head size.\nWhite matter (WM) microstructural integrity measures of free water (FW), free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA), and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) were derived from DTI sequences using previously described algorithms. 212223 Briefly, FW and FA were derived from the WM mask, which was defined by thresholding the FSL FA template at a value of 0.3 to reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume contamination. 23,24 PSMD was calculated using a publicly available script (PSMD Marker, 25 version 0.95), as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles of the voxelbased mean diffusivity (MD) values within the subjects MD skeleton, after application of FA threshold and custom-made masks to avoid contamination of the skeleton by CSF partial volume effects. 22,23 The rationale for selecting the above-mentioned DTI measures was twofold. First, their inter-rater reliability, test-retest repeatability, and inter-scanner reproducibility have been previously explored and ascertained. 23 Second, the used algorithms for FA and PSMD calculation account for CSF contamination of the diffusion signal, to provide tissue-specific DTI indices and consequently allow for more accurate inferences about the underlying WM tissue structure. 21,22,26",

In stratified analyses, higher leptin bioavailability was associated with better visuospatial skills and executive function in men. These associations were not observed in the total sample but became evident in subgroup analyses despite the lower power, indicating that sex might act as an effect modifier in the relationships between leptin and cognition. In line with this hypothesis, excessive leptin per unit fat was positively associated with cognitive performance in white men but not women in the Dallas Heart Study. 35",

      "text": "Higher plasma leptin concentrations were associated with larger total cerebral brain volume but not with temporal horn volume in a subsample of 198 cognitively healthy participants with a mean age of 79 years from the Original cohort of the FHS. 8 Furthermore, in 527 Dutch participants 70-82 years of age from the Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk for vascular disease (PROSPER) study, higher serum leptin was associated with higher volume of the amygdala but not with other brain volumes. 36 Conversely, higher plasma leptin was associated with regional brain volume deficits in a set of 517 participants (mean age 75 years) from the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) study. 37 The variability surrounding these prior findings might be due to residual confounding introduced by the accumulation of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies in older individuals, 383940 which might in turn alter leptin signaling pathways. 414243 To overcome this issue, along with potential power limitations of prior approaches, we studied the associations of leptin markers with volumetric brain indices in a relatively large sample of cognitively healthy middle-aged adults with  1 prevalence of CVD. Additionally, taking into account that the development of central leptin resistance might lead to a state of relative leptin deficiency despite apparently high concentrations of circulating leptin, 13 we included leptin bioavailability in our analysis, considering it might better reflect underlying leptin signaling states.\nNevertheless, no associations of leptin markers with total brain, cortical gray matter, or hippocampal volumes were observed in the younger FHS sample. This might be related to the relatively young age (brain volume changes usually appear later in life 44 ) and overall good cognitive and cardiovascular health of study participants, leading to an overall preserved brain morphology.",

    "Leptin markers and white matter microstructural integrity": {
      "text": "The disconnected brain hypothesis posits that aging-accompanying cognitive changes are the consequence of disrupted communication between different (mainly distant) cortical regions since higher-order cognitive functions rely on the speed and efficiency of communication among large-scale neural networks. 45,46 WM integrity seems to mediate this relationship between age and cognition through cortical disconnection 46 ; therefore, WM integrity alterations might explain potential deviations from the normal aging pattern that lead to the development of dementia. This is evidenced by the loss of WM integrity in AD, starting in the prodromal stages, 47 and in individuals with VCID, during both the symptomatic 48 and pre-symptomatic 49 period.\nConsequently, alterations in WM integrity likely represent an early subclinical process in those at risk for cognitive impairment due to AD andor vascular pathology, entities collectively accounting for the vast majority of dementia cases worldwide. 50 WM integrity can be evaluated using DTI-derived measures, with FA (expressing the degree to which a single diffusion orientation is dominant) and MD (expressing the average amount of apparent diffusion along each of the three diffusion axes) being among the most commonly used ones; higher FA and lower MD indicate higher tissue integrity. 51 A more recent diffusion metric is the FW index, which measures the fraction of the diffusion signal explained by isotropically unrestricted water. 21 FW has been proposed as a sensitive biomarker of cognitive function and of subtle brain injury related to vascular risk factors. 51,52 It might also aid in the differentiation between healthy individuals and those with AD or MCI. 53 Although the precise biological mechanisms linking increases in WM FW signal to AD or vascular pathology remain unclear, these could, for example, involve WM inflammation in the setting of AD, 54 or vasogenic edema and intramyelinic vacuolization in the setting of small vessel disease. 55 Herein, we report associations of leptin bioavailability with all markers of WM integrity considered in the present analysis. These findings support the putative neuroprotective role of leptin, 13,56,57 and might account for its previously reported associations with lower dementia risk. 8 Specifically, the link of higher leptin bioavailability during midlife with better preservation of WM microstructure suggests a potential for better maintenance of cognitive functions and, consequently, lower dementia risk later in life by virtue of more efficient connectivity. Of note, the effect sizes of the associations between leptin bioavailability and PSMD were larger in participants with excess WHR, indicating that potential benefits might be even higher for individuals with visceral obesity.\nImportantly, we replicated the association of increased leptin receptor concentrations with higher PSMD in an independent sample of dementia-free Mexican American older adults, expanding the generalizability and external validity of our findings. Associations with other DTI measures were not significant in our replication sample, likely due to the considerably smaller size (n  89), limiting the power to detect associations compared to FHS. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the sensitivity of PSMD to capture associations between measures of interest and WM microstructural changes, even in small samples. This might be related to a variety of reasons. First, MD is one of the most robust metrics with respect to underlying WM tissue characteristics. 58 In contrast, FA has been criticized for its dependency on fiber geometry. Specifically, higher FA values might not necessarily reflect better tissue integrity (e.g., higher fiber density, lower membrane permeability, greater myelination, etc.), due to the presence of crossing fibers throughout the majority of cerebral WM. 58 Notably, PSMD performs even better than traditional MD by leveraging skeletonization to focus the analysis of MD on the main fiber tracts, eliminating CSF contamination. 22 Perhaps even more importantly for replication purposes, the peak width is calculated as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles of the voxel-based MD values within the skeleton and does not depend on absolute MD values, rendering PSMD less prone to inter-scanner and inter-study differences than other DTI parameters. 22",

We also replicated the association of higher leptin receptor concentration with worse WM microstructural integrity, as assessed with PSMD, in an older sample of different ethnicity with synchronous exposure and outcome assessments. Nevertheless, the cross-sectional design of the present analysis does not allow for causal or temporal inferences. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine associations of leptin bioavailability in middle age with the risk for dementia or cognitive decline later in life.

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Pioneering anatomical and clinical-anatomical correlational studies in the 1800s and 1900s fueled interest in human higher cortical functions (Reil and Autenrieth 1809;Broca 1865;Meynert 1865;Wernicke 1874;Dejerine 1895;Flechsig 1901;Brodmann 1905;Economo 1929;Ludwig and Klingler 1956;Geschwind 1965;Luria 1980). In the experimental domain, anatomical investigations in rhesus monkeys expanded to a great extent our knowledge of primate cortical architectonic connections in the second half of the twentieth century (Pandya and Yeterian 1985;Schmahmann and Pandya 2006). In recent years, the advent of diffusion imaging (DTI) (Le Bihan et al. 1986;Basser et al. 1994) enabled the study of connections in humans, both ex-vivo and, most importantly, in-vivo in a noninvasive fashion. Thus it was not surprising that the possibility of using diffusion imaging rekindled the study of in-vivo association cortico-cortical connectivity and higher brain functions such as language in humans (Makris et al. 1997).\nAware of the methodological limitations of both the DTIHARDI technique (Basser et al. 1994;Tuch et al. 2002) and experimental animal tracing techniques (Cowan et al. 1972;Mesulam 1978), especially of the former in delineating the origins and terminations of fiber pathways (Makris et al. 1999;Makris et al. 2002a;Makris et al. 1997;Schmahmann and Pandya 2006), pioneers of DTI-based long association cortico-cortical connectivity investigations used the classical descriptions of fiber tracts by Dejerine (1895) to validate DTI results regarding human fiber tract anatomy (Makris 1999;Makris et al. 1997) as well as to extrapolate from known monkey fiber tract anatomy (Makris 1999;Makris et al. 2005;Makris et al. 2002a;Rilling et al. 2008). Although monkey anatomical connectivity served initially as a solid and useful testbed for DTI studies of human anatomical connectivity, given the cortical architectonic differences and cognitive dissimilarities between the two species, it was also expected that long cortico-cortical association fiber pathways would show significant differences in humans compared to monkeys (Makris et al. 2005) as clearly demonstrated by Rilling and colleagues (2008) using diffusion imaging-based tractographic studies (Lori et al. 2002;Mori et al. 1999).\nOne discovery in human cortico-cortical long association connectivity that originated by extrapolation from monkey experimental material is that of the middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) (Seltzer and Pandya 1984). In monkeys, this fiber tract originates from inferior parietal area PG-Opt (equivalent to human angular gyrus) and terminates in areas TPO, PGA and IPa along the upper bank and depth of the superior temporal sulcus (Seltzer and Pandya 1984). In humans, this long association fiber tract was missed by pioneers of human neuroanatomy of the 19 th and 20 th centuries (Reil and Autenrieth 1809;Burdach 1822;Meynert 1865;Dejerine 1895;Flechsig 1901;Ludwig and Klingler 1956) and was first demonstrated in the human brain only recently. Whereas a histological pilot study using a single brain suggested the presence of MdLF in humans (Makris 1999), a preliminary DTI study in four living subjects demonstrated its existence in the human brain (Makris et al. 2009). MdLF was originally described as a long association fiber pathway within the white matter of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) connecting the STG and temporal pole (TP) with the ipsilateral angular gyrus in the inferior parietal lobule (Makris et al. 2009). A number of subsequent studies using diffusion MRI tractography (Makris et al. 2013a;Makris et al. 2013b;Men jot de Champfleur et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2013) and fiber microdissection (Maldonado et al. 2013;Martino et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2013) expanded our knowledge of the connections of MdLF in humans, showing additional connections of the STG with several parietal and occipital cortical regions.\nIn the present study, drawing on the existing literature and our own experience we tested the hypothesis that MdLF in humans interconnects the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and dorsal temporal pole (dorsal TP) with the associative cortical regions of the parietal (namely, the angular, AG and supramarginal, SMG gyri, superior parietal lobule, SPL and precuneus, PCN) and occipital (namely, the cuneus, CN and lateral occipital region, LOCC) lobes. To this end we used a tractographic algorithm that selectively connected only cortical areas (cortex-to-cortex connections) and not the white matter underneath them as currently practiced in routine diffusion imaging-based tractographic studies. Furthermore, this study investigated the complete cortico-cortical connectivity of MdLF as currently documented. The results revealed four temporo-parietal and two temporo-occipital cortico-cortical components of this fiber tract in 70 subjects (140 cerebral hemispheres). To our knowledge this is the first study to achieve this goal.",

    "Methods": {
      "text": "We used magnetic HARDI-based tractography in 70 human subjects to accomplish three goals: a) to delineate the principal cortical regions of origin andor termination of MdLF within the temporo-parietal and temporo-occipital cortices, specifically the STG, TP, AG, SMG, SPL, PCN (temporo-parietal) and CN, LOCC (temporo-occipital); b) to map these six subcomponents of the MdLF, i.e., the superior temporal-angular or STG(MdLF)AG connection, the superior temporal-supramarginal or STG(MdLF)SMG connection, the superior temporal-superior parietal lobule or STG(MdLF)SPL connection, the superior temporal-precuneus or STG(MdLF)PCN connection, the superior temporal-cuneus or STG(MdLF)CN connection and the superior temporal-lateral occipital or STG(MdLF)LOCC connection and determine their relative topography within the MdLF; and c) to generate a database of biophysical parameters, such as FA, AD, RD and volume for STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN and STG(MdLF)LOCC. Terminology As in a previous publication (Makris et al. 2013b) we used the following naming convention to identify the six connections of the MdLF. The fiber pathway (MdLF) appears in parentheses with the gray matter structures it connects to on either side. For instance STG(MdLF)AG denotes that the MdLF fiber tract connects the STG and AG gray matter regions; in other words the gray matter regions STG and AG are connected via the MdLF fiber pathway. For simplicity, in the term STG(MdLF)AG, STG includes the dorsal part of temporal pole as well as the superior temporal gyrus. This usage is consistent throughout the text, table and figures.",

Of these subjects, 68 were right-handed, one was lefthanded and one was ambidextrous. None of the subjects presented with a diagnosed neurological disorder or history of alcohol or other drug dependency. Subjects were recruited through newspaper advertisements as part of a larger study, and were ascertained to have no Axis I disorder according to the SCID INP the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (First et al. 1996). This study was approved by the IRBs of both the VA Boston Healthcare System, Brockton Division, and Brigham and Womens Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to study participation. Thirty-seven of these 70 subjects participated in the primary study published by our group (Makris et al. 2013a), and all 70 participated in another study of ours (Makris et al. 2013b) using different anatomical hypotheses, experimental design and methods of diffusion imaging tractographic analysis.",

      "text": "All subjects were scanned on a 3T GE Echospeed system (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using T1-weighted, T2-weighted and echo planar imaging (EPI) HARDI pulse sequences. The T1-weighted sequence consisted of the following parameters: TR  7.4 ms, TE  3 ms, TI  600, 10 flip angle, 25.6 cm 2 field of view, matrix  256  256. The voxel dimensions were 1  1  1 mm 3 . The T2-weighted acquisition (namely, eXtended Echo Train Acquisition) produced a series of contiguous images with TR  2500 ms, TE  80 ms, 25.6 cm 2 field of view, and voxel dimensions of 1  1  1 mm 3 . The HARDI acquisition used a double echo sequence (Alexander et al. 1997;Heid 2000) with an 8-channel coil and ASSET (Array Spatial Sensitivity Encoding Techniques, GE); a SENSEfactor (speed-up) of 2 was used to reduce eddy-current and EPI spatial related distortions. A product GE sequence was modified to accommodate for higher spatial resolution, i.e., a spatial-spectral pulse was replaced by Fat-Sat suppression pulse, and echo spacing was decreased by 15 to accommodate for more slices per TR. Fifty-one (51) noncollinear diffusion directions with b  900 and eight baseline scans with b  0 were acquired. Eightyfive (85) axial slices parallel to the AC-PC (anterior commissure-posterior commissure) line spanning the entire brain (no gap) were collected for each subject. Scan parameters were as follows: TR  17000 ms, TE  78 ms, FOV  24 cm, 144  144 encoding steps with slice thickness  1.7 mm, producing isotropic 1.71.71.7 mm 3 voxels. Total scanning time for the HARDI sequence was 17 minutes. Diffusion data were prepared by removing motion and eddy current artifacts from the raw data using software based on FSL (http: www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). Noise filtering was done using a one-step recursive LMMSE estimator for signal estimation and noise removal assuming a Rician noise model (Aja-Fernandez et al. 2008). After reconstruction, diffusion-weighted images were transferred to a LINUX workstation, on which diffusion tensors were estimated in 3-D Slicer software, and then FA, AD and RD were computed from the primary tensor oriented along the fiber tract at each voxel.",

The T1-weighted images from each subject were motion-corrected, averaged, and normalized for intensity; subsequently, automated computational reconstruction of brain surface and segmentation of the cortical and subcortical structures was done. Finally, segmentation and automatic labeling of cortical (i.e., cortical parcellation) and subcortical regions (Desikan et al. 2006;Fischl et al. 2002) were done by implementing algorithms as described by Fischl and colleagues (Dale et al. 1999;Fischl and Dale 2000;Fischl et al. 1999). All ROIs identified in our hypotheses, i.e., STG, TP, AG, SMG, SPL, PCN, CN and LOCC, were characterized using these methods.",

    "Tractographic delineation of MdLF": {
      "text": "HARDI tractography was performed in 3D-Slicer (v2.7, www.slicer.org), using a multitensor tractography algorithm (Malcolm et al. 2010). This algorithm uses tractography to drive the local fiber model estimation, i.e., model estimation (in this case, the multiple tensors) is done while tracing a fiber from seed to termination. It must be pointed out that fiber is a computational term used throughout this study to denote virtual fibers. Because existing techniques independently estimate the model parameters at each voxel (throughout the brain) prior to tractography, there is no running knowledge of confidence in the estimated model fit. Furthermore, noise can significantly affect the estimated model parameters particularly in the case of multi-tensor models, which others including Malcolm and colleagues (2010) and Baumgartner and colleagues (Baumgartner et al. 2012) have compared with existing methods. Malcolm and colleagues (Malcolm et al. 2010) describe an algorithm that formulates fiber tracking as a recursive estimation process, wherein the estimate at each step of tracing the fiber is guided by those previous estimates. In this model, tractography is performed within a filter framework that uses a discrete mixture of Gaussian tensors to model the signal. Starting from a seed point, each fiber is traced to its termination using an unscented Kalman filter to simultaneously fit the local model to the signal and propagate it in the most consistent direction. Despite the presence of noise and uncertainty, this method provides a causal estimate of the local structure at each point along the fiber. Furthermore, because each iteration begins with a near-optimal solution based on the previous estimation, the convergence of model fitting is improved and local minima are naturally avoided. Another important aspect of this algorithm is that it provides a measure of confidence (a covariance matrix) in the estimation of the parameters at each step, which can remove false positives in tractography. This approach reduces signal reconstruction error and significantly improves the angular resolution at crossings and branchings. Because it enables detection of two eigenvalues in a voxel, this method resolves the problem of crossing fibers, allowing fiber tracing in areas known to contain such crossing and branching (Rathi et al. 2010). White matter voxels in the brain (FA  0.15) were used as seed points for (wholebrain) tractography. We then obtained six different fiber tracts for each hemisphere by selecting only the fibers that passed through specific regions for each MdLF connection. All six fiber tracts included the following regions: cortex of the superior temporal gyrus (STG), temporal pole (TP), and a white matter ROI within STG. To generate each individual fiber tract we used the above ROIs with the addition of one of the six cortical ROIs, in the parietal or the occipital lobe. For example, for the generation of STG(MdLF)AG the cortex of the angular gyrus (AG) was included in the analysis with STG, TP and the STG white matter ROI. Thus all six fiber tracts -STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN, and STG(MdLF)LOCC -were delineated using this approach (Figures 1 and2).\nWhereas the cortical ROIs in the STG, TP, AG, SMG, SPL, PCN, CN and LOCC were determined automatically using FreeSurfer, as noted previously, the STG white matter ROI was defined manually. Specifically, this ROI was set by sampling all voxels within the white matter of the STG in a single coronal section in the rostral one-third of the STG, precisely 17 mm caudal to the frontotemporal junction (FTJ), as shown in Figure 1. It is important to note that FTJ corresponds to Y  4 mm in the rostrocaudal dimension of the Talairach coordinate space system. Given that the STG spans 4 mm to -55 mm in the Talairach Y rostrocaudal dimension, the white matter STG ROI is located approximately at Y  -13 mm and thus within the rostral one-third of STG in Talairach space. This is important for assuring that fibers of the MdLF course through the anterior part of the STG. Therefore, the tractographic approach used in this study had two necessary conditions, i.e., specification of the cortical ROIs and the white matter ROI. The first condition for selection of the cortical ROIs ensured that only fibers originating and terminating within these temporal, parietal and occipital cortical regions could be sampled and any fibers passing through their underlying white matter compartment but not entering or exiting these cortices were excluded. Positioning the white matter ROI only within the STG, which also ensured the sampling of all STG white matter voxels in that coronal section, guaranteed that only fibers coursing within the STG were sampled, hence excluding fibers coursing in adjacent regions such as the extreme capsule (EmC) or the middle temporal gyrus. To ensure the anatomical accuracy of MdLF reconstructions, all cases were inspected and all neighboring long association fiber tracts were delineated in five brains by one of the authors (NM) using procedures previously described by our group (Makris et al. 2005;Makris and Pandya 2009;Makris et al. 2002b;Makris et al. 2009;Makris et al. 2007b;Makris et al. 2013a). Differentiating the MdLF from other fiber tracts such as the EmC, the inferior frontooccipital fascicle (IFOF) and, especially, the arcuate fascicle (AF) is critical (Makris et al. 2013a;Makris et al. 2013b). The distinct trajectories and topographic relationships of MdLF, AF, EmC, IFOF and other long association fiber pathways are shown in detail in Figure 3A. The two necessary conditions set in this method help to ensure the exclusion of EmC, IFOF and AF fibers.",

The FA map of each subject was registered linearly using FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith 2001), and then nonlinearly using ANTS (Avants et al. 2008). We then applied the same deformation to the fiber tracts to set them in MNI152 space and calculated a fiber tract mask on the MNI152 template for each subject. In this mask a voxel has a value only if a tract traverses it. Finally, to obtain the probabilistic maps, we averaged the masks of all subjects. Furthermore, we computed probabilistic maps of average (across individuals) tract representations overlaid onto the MNI template brain. The tract terminations of each MdLF branch were projected on the inflated brain surface (generated using FreeSurfer) of the MNI brain.",

We further differentiated MdLF from ILF, given their close topographical relationship as shown in Figure 3B. Furthermore, the delineation of the STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN and STG(MdLF)LOCC connections within the MdLF were determined tractographically (Figure 4A,B). With a sample of 70 normal subjects, this is the largest study for all six subcomponents of MdLF according to our previous data (Makris et al. 2013a). STG(MdLF)AG connections were acquired on the left in 41(59) subjects and on right in 39(56) subjects. STG(MdLF)SMG connections were acquired on the left in 37(53) subjects and on the right in 32(46), STG(MdLF)SPL connections were acquired on the left in 36(51) subjects and on the right in 35(49.3) subjects.

This reconstruction represents the MdLF tracts of the entire subject population. The 3-D Slicer software environment was used to create these images.\nThree-dimensional reconstructions elucidated the relative topography of STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN, and STG(MdLF)LOCC within the MdLF. Within the STG white matter core, STG(MdLF)AG was located ventrally and laterally with respect to STG(MdLF)SPL, which was positioned dorsally and medially, whereas the fibers of the other less prominent fiber tracts remained intertwined within this space. Caudally at the temporo-parietal and temporo-occipital transition of STG the six fiber tracts split and course as separate entities within the parietal and occipital lobes (Figures 3 and7). STG(MdLF)AG follows a lateral course penetrating the cortex of AG, whereas STG(MdLF)SMG follows a distinct trajectory remaining rostroventral to STG(MdLF)AG. STG(MdLF)SPL courses dorsally and medially with respect to STG(MdLF)AG to enter the cortex of SPL, whereas STG(MdLF)PCN courses medially to STG(MdLF)SPL and enters the cortex of PCN. The two temporo-occipital connections of STG, i.e., STG(MdLF)LOCC and STG(MdLF)CN follow more ventral trajectories with respect to temporo-parietal fiber pathways. Consistent with the mesial location of the cuneus and the position of the lateral occipital cortex in the lateral aspect of the occipital lobe, the STG(MdLF)CN remains medial to the STG(MdLF)LOCC (Figure 7). In addition, we reconstructed these fiber tracts using Talairach coordinates in the MNI standard space (Figure 7).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study we delineated six distinct connections within the MdLF in seventy subjects using multi-tensor tractography. Importantly, these connections were cortex-to-cortex connections, specifically between the cortex of the superior temporal gyrus (including the dorsal part of the temporal pole) and the cortices of the angular gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, the superior parietal lobule and the precuneus in the parietal lobe, and the cortices of the cuneus and the lateral occipital region in the occipital lobe. We then mapped them in MNI and Talairach standard spaces. Furthermore, we generated a database of volume and length and of biophysical parameters, such as FA, AD and RD, for STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN and STG(MdLF)LOCC.\nThe scant available literature on MdLF makes the present study the first systematic, quantitative analysis of six specific subcomponents of the human MdLF, of which four are temporo-parietal and two temporo-occipital. This pathway was originally proposed in humans as a long cortico-cortical connection between STG (including the TP) and AG by Makris and colleagues (2009) using DTI tractography in four subjects (eight hemispheres) (Makris et al. 2009), following a hypothesis based on rhesus monkey autoradiographic (Seltzer and Pandya 1984) and preliminary human histological (Makris 1999) data. Since the appearance of MdLF in the mainstream of human neuroanatomical literature in 2009, our understanding of this long association fiber tract has been evolving. The original MdLF connection between the STG and AG in humans has been confirmed by a few neuroimaging studies (Kamali et al. 2014a;Kamali et al. 2014b;Men jot de Champfleur et al. 2013;Turken and Dronkers 2011). Furthermore, the connectivity of MdLF has been expanded to additional postrolandic regions in the superior and medial parietal as well as the lateral and medial occipital lobes using diffusion imaging tractography (Kamali et al. 2014a;Kamali et al. 2014b;Makris et al. 2013a;Men jot de Champfleur et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2013) and fiber microdissection (Maldonado et al. 2013;Martino et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2013). A unifying aspect of these different MdLF connections is that all are long cortico-cortical association fiber tracts that course within the core white matter of the superior temporal gyrus. Given MdLFs morphological and connectional complexity as well as the diversity of methodologies used for its delineation, the definition of this fiber tract has created some confusion (De Witt Hamer et al. 2011;Maldonado et al. 2013;Wang et al. 2013). To help clarify the nature of MdLF in this growing conundrum, a detailed delineation and precise description of each of its connections in terms of origin and termination as well as of its trajectory could be highly relevant. Therefore, the combination of tractography along with a) precise cortical information, as provided by cortical parcellation techniques (Caviness et al. 1996;Desikan et al. 2006;Fischl et al. 2002) and b) unequivocal topographic information by mapping the fiber tracts onto a standard stereotactic space (Evans et al. 1993;Talairach and Tournoux 1988) as implemented in this study and other studies by our group (Makris et al. 2009;Makris et al. 2013a;Makris et al. 2013b), seem two logical requirements of this process. It should be noted that portions of adjacent fiber tracts may occupy some common space along their trajectories, i.e., there can be evident, partial commingling of fibers within a common space or cloud as elaborated upon in a recent study by our group (Makris et al. 2015). This is of interest in this study given the apparent communalities that STG(MdLF)LOCC and ILF present even though they are two distinct fiber tracts (Figures 3B, 7D and8).",

    "Functional roles of subcomponents of MdLF": {
      "text": "The cortical areas of origin and termination in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes of MdLF are associated with a variety of functions and its six subcomponents are a structural part of the networks that carry out these functions. Based on this principle of functional neuroanatomy and in the light of our present results some general comments with respect to the possible functions of MdLF can be made with respect to language, attention and higher level visual and auditory processing. More specifically, MdLFs possible function in language stems from the connection of STG with the inferior parietal lobule (AG and SMG), lateralized on the left (Makris et al. 2009;Makris et al. 2013a;Makris et al. 2013b). Interestingly, our results showed a small leftward lateralization for both STG(MdLF)AG (left 59 vs. right 56 of the subjects) and STG(MdLF)SMG (left 53 vs. right 46 of the subjects) connections. More specifically, the STG(MdLF)AG connection could be part of the stream involved in coding of sublexical representations (such as phonemes and syllables) into articulatory forms and in acoustic-phonetic processing of words and word production as suggested in Hickok and Poeppels model of speech processing (Hickok 2001;Hickok andPoeppel 2000, 2007). By contrast, the STG(MdLF)SMG connection may be involved in phonetic processing as suggested recently by Gow et al. (Gow et al. 2009;Gow et al. 2008) using magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography and MRI. In this model, a feedback association between SMG and posterior STG would account for normalizing posterior STG phonetic representations (Gow et al. 2009). Moreover, a recent study by Mesulam and colleagues (Mesulam et al. 2015) indicated that the left anterior temporal lobe (including the temporal pole) is involved in word and sentence comprehension, which supports MdLFs role in the language network, a notion supported also by functional connectivity work by Kellmeyer et al. (2013). It is of interest to note that the human anterior temporal region is homologous to a similar region of the monkey brain known to be connected with parietooccipital areas by MdLF (e.g., Seltzer and Pandya 1984;Schmahmann and Pandya 2006). This anterior temporal region in the monkey plays a key role in conspecific auditory communication and is considered part of the what (vs. where) cortical auditory pathway (e.g., Petkov et al. 2008;Rauschecker and Tian 2000;Tian et al. 2001). Another possible functional role of MdLF may be in visuospatial and attention functions. This would be ascribed principally to its connection with the right inferior parietal lobule and with the superior parietal lobule bilaterally and the STG(MdLF)SPL connection. SPL is known to code body part location information in a body-centered coordinate system and to establish the relative location of objects with respect to the body (e.g., Duffy and Burchfiel 1971;Lacquaniti et al. 1995;Mountcastle et al. 1975;Sakata et al. 1973) indicating STG(MdLF)SPLs role in visuospatial attention (Suchan et al. 2014;Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2011). Moreover, SPL along with the AG would play an important role in attention processing, which is a dominant function of the right hemisphere (e.g., Cabeza and Nyberg 2000;Corbetta and Shulman 2002;Critchley 1966;Duncan and Owen 2000;Goldman-Rakic 1988;Heilman et al. 1970;Heilman and Valenstein 1985;Heilman and Van Den Abell 1980;Heilman et al. 1983;Mesulam 1990Mesulam , 1998;;Posner and Petersen 1990). Our current analysis did not reveal a significant lateralization for STG(MdLF)SPL (i.e., left 50.7 vs. right 49.3 of the subjects). Our results indicating a non-significant asymmetry with respect to the STG to IPL connection also suggested the greater relevance of the STG(MdLF)AG and STG(MdLF)SMG connections in the right hemisphere, consistent with the role of the superior temporal cortex in both monkeys (Watson et al. 1994) and humans (Karnath et al. 2001) in attention processing, which may be as prominent as language in the left hemisphere.",

    "Possible functional role of MdLF in high order auditory and visual association functions": {
      "text": "The fibers of MdLF connect with the dorsal part of TP (BA 38), which corresponds roughly to areas TAr and TAp and is rostral to von Economos area TA (Ding et al. 2009). Area TAr has been shown to be associated with higher order auditory association processing in monkeys (Poremba et al. 2003), whereas area TAp is polysensory association cortex (Bruce et al. 1981;Seltzer andPandya 1978, 1991) showing responses to both auditory and visual stimuli in monkeys (Poremba et al. 2003). Importantly, it has been shown that SPL is involved in integrative processing of audio-visual multisensory information in humans (Molholm et al. 2006). Thus MdLF connections between the TP and AG, SPL, CN and LOCC could play a role in integrating auditory with visual information.",

    "Clinical implications": {
      "text": "Given the extensive connectivity provided by MdLF between the superior temporal gyrus and temporal pole and the entire parietal lobe and the associative cortices of the medial and lateral occipital lobe, this fiber tract may be involved in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. These could include primary progressive aphasia (Mesulam et al. 2015;Sapolsky et al. 2010) and other aphasic syndromes, some forms of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (Rascovsky et al. 2011), atypical forms of Alzheimers disease in which temporoparietal degeneration is relatively focal (Crutch et al. 2013), corticobasal degeneration (Armstrong et al. 2013), schizophrenia (Armstrong et al. 2013;Asami et al. 2013) as well as attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neglect disorders (Heilman and Valenstein 1985;Makris et al. 2007a). Primary progressive aphasia and aphasic syndromes The MdLFs strong connections between the superior temporal gyrus (including the dorsal temporal pole) and the inferior parietal lobule (angular and supramarginal gyri) seem to be critical components of the language system in the dominant hemisphere (Dejerine 1895;Geschwind and Galaburda 1987), especially for word and sentence comprehension (Mesulam et al. 2015) the breakdown of which is a hallmark of classical Wernickes aphasia or in semantic logopenic forms of Primary progressive aphasia (Gorno-Tempini et al. 2011). In these aphasia syndromes the involvement of the MdLF may be one of the core neuroanatomical features of the clinical phenotype. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia Although not usually associated with tracts such as the MdLF, some forms of bvFTD affect primarily the right temporal pole and adjacent structures within the temporal cortex, leading to socioaffective impairments, prosopagnosia, and other person specific multimodal semantic memory impairment (Chan et al. 2009). FTD patients with genetic mutations in granulin (GRN) often have lateralized neurodegeneration with much more notable involvement of the posterior temporal and parietal cortex than is typically seen in FTD (Whitwell et al. 2012); these patients likely have substantial involvement of the MdLF and may have substantial topographic disorientation or limb apraxia. Alzheimers disease (AD) is usually conceptualized as initially affecting medial temporal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, and related circuitry; however, many atypical variants of AD are associated with focal degeneration of the temporoparietal cortex (Wolk et al. 2010).\nPosterior cortical atrophy is one such variant (Crutch et al. 2013) as is young-onset AD (Barnes et al. 2015); these patients tend to have less prominent memory loss and more prominent visuospatial symptoms (including Balints syndrome) or transcortical aphasia syndromes with or without Gerstmanns syndrome (Benson et al. 1988). Corticobasal degeneration is associated with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, alien limb syndrome, myoclonus, and varying degrees of language or visuospatial impairment depending on lateralization; localization tends to feature asymmetric perirolandic neurodegeneration with involvement of inferior parietal lobule (Armstrong et al. 2013). Schizophrenia Positive symptoms such as thought disorder and auditory hallucinations have been associated with abnormalities of the left superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenia and it seems that MdLF may be a critical fiber tract in this disorder (Barta et al. 1990;Kasai et al. 2003;Asami et al. 2013;Makris et al. 2010;Rajarethinam et al. 2004). attention-deficithyperactivity disorder and neglect disorders. The MdLFs strong connections between the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior and superior parietal lobules in the non-dominant hemisphere are important parts of the visuospatial attention system (Heilman and Van Den Abell 1980;Thiebaut de Schotten et al. 2011). Therefore any damage to these connections could result in ADHD (Makris et al. 2007a;Makris et al. 2008) or certain forms of neglect disorders such as hemiinattention and hemispatial neglect (Heilman and Valenstein 1985).",

    "Quantitative analyses": {
      "text": "The volumes, length, mean FA, mean AD, and mean RD of the left and right STG(MdLF)AG, STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN, STG(MdLF)CN, and STG(MdLF)LOCC in 70 healthy human subjects are shown in Table 1 andFigure 5. The overall mean volume of MdLF was 5.475 cm 3 (5.23 cm 3 on the left, and 5.72 cm 3 on the right). These values are slightly higher than yet similar to previous observations by our group performed in a smaller number of subjects, in which the overall volume of the MdLF was found to be 4.55 cm 3 (Makris et al. 2009) or 4.125 cm 3 (Makris et al. 2013a). Thus, the present observations corroborate those of our earlier investigation. MdLF occupies approximately 1.27 of total cerebral white matter, which has been estimated to be 432.47 cm 3 (Makris et al. 1999). Compared with other long association fiber tracts, MdLF is a medium size long association fiber bundle. It is roughly the same size as SLF III, smaller than the cingulum bundle and SLF II, and larger than the superior occipitofrontal fascicle (Makris et al. 2007b). The MdLF mean FA was .324 on the left and .340 on the right, similar to the FA reported in a previous study of MdLF (Makris et al. 2009) and in other studies of different fiber tracts in the normal human brain (Klingberg et al. 2000;Pierpaoli and Basser 1996). Analysis of symmetry The MdLF showed minor leftward volumetric asymmetry for the STG(MdLF)AG and STG(MdLF)SMG connections, which are language function related on the left. These asymmetries were not statistically significant as was the case for other biophysical parameters such as FA, AD and RD. Given that the MdLF may be functionally involved in language in the left hemisphere but may also play a prominent role in visuospatial attention function in the right hemisphere, it may be that both the left and the right MdLFs are comparably robust, resulting in no significant asymmetry of their biophysical characteristics. In this analysis, we did not observe any significant asymmetry in length.",

    "Limitations and future studies": {
      "text": "When interpreting results of this study, a number of limitations should be considered. This sample of 70 normal subjects is the largest so far for MdLF analyses. However, with much larger samples and with higher spatial resolution, we may acquire a more complete understanding of the different connections of MdLF and of their quantitative profiles. Furthermore, given that our results are based on a group containing predominantly males, they should not be considered representative of female MdLF fiber connections. Moreover, although our diffusion data are of high quality and high resolution, the majority of limitations of the methodology still apply, i.e., DTI can lead to topological interpretations that are biased by the anatomical contents of the tissue (i.e., multiple intersecting axons within one voxel) and can misrepresent actual tract anatomy. Besides the limitations inherent to diffusion imaging tractography, another limitation is the lack of an anatomical gold standard in the human brain with respect to the origins and terminations of the long association fiber tracts, a critical fact that has been raised since the beginning of diffusion tensor imaging of human association fiber tracts (Makris et al. 1997). Thus there is currently an abundance of conflicting information regarding the precise anatomy of human cerebral connectivity. Future functional studies using language and attention paradigms and implementing multimodal neuroimaging procedures of functional and structural MRI may elucidate further the role of the different subcomponents of the MdLF in human cognition.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "Based on multi-tensor DTI tractographic analysis we delineated and quantified six connections of the superior temporal gyrus (including the dorsal temporal pole) with the parietal and occipital lobes within MdLF in 70 healthy adult volunteers (68 right-handed), the largest population in which this recently discovered human fiber tract has been studied to date. Moving beyond previous studies, we were able to quantify these six subcomponents of MdLF, namely four temporo-parietal and two temporo-occipital. The strongest connections of the MdLF were principally with temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule and precuneus. Based on the functional roles of the cortical areas that are interconnected, we suggest that the STG(MdLF)AG, and STG(MdLF)SMG, STG(MdLF)SPL, STG(MdLF)PCN connections of the STG with the parietal lobes may be related to language and attention processing. By contrast, the STG(MdLF)CN and STG(MdLF)LOCC connections may play a role in higher order visual processing. Finally, MdLF connections of the anterior temporal region, including TP, with AG, SPL, CN and LOCC, may play a role in integrating auditory with visual information. The cortical ROIs have been segmented using FreeSurfer and the tracing done using the white matter query language (WMQL) software as elaborated upon in Methods. Temporoparietal connections (upper diagrams) comprise the superior temporal-angular gyrus, STG(MdLF)AG; superior temporal-supramarginal gyrus, STG(MdLF)SMG; superior temporal-superior parietal lobule, STG(MdLF)SPL; and superior temporal-precuneus, STG(MdLF)PCN, fiber tracts, whereas temporo-occipital connections (lower diagrams) include the superior temporal-cuneus, STG(MdLF)CN, and superior temporal-lateral occipital, STG(MdLF)LOCC, fiber tracts. tract representations overlaid onto the MNI template brain. The tract terminations of each MdLF branch were projected on the inflated brain surface (generated using FreeSurfer) of the MNI brain. In 8G-J, the ILF (in dark and light blue) is similarly shown for the purpose of comparison with the MdLF (in red) branches. It should be noted that the only branch of MdLF sharing common space with ILF is STG(MdLF)LOCC.",

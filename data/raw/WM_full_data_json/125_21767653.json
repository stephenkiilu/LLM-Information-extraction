    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize the transgenic Huntington rat model with in vivo imaging and identify sensitive and reliable biomarkers associated with early and progressive disease status. In order to do so, we performed a multimodality (DTI and PET) longitudinal imaging study, during which the same TgHD and wildtype (Wt) rats were repetitively scanned. Surprisingly, the relative ventricle volume was smaller but increased faster in TgHD compared to Wt animals. DTI (mean, axial, radial diffusivity) revealed subtle genotype-specific aging effects in the striatum and its surrounding white matter, already in the presymptomatic stage. Using 18 F-FDG and 18 F-Fallypride PET imaging, we were not able to demonstrate genotype-specific aging effects within the striatum. The outcome of this longitudinal study was somewhat surprising as it demonstrated a significant differential aging pattern in TgHD versus Wt animals. Although it seems that the TgHD rat model does not have a sufficient expression of disease yet at the age of 12 months, further validation of this model is highly beneficial since there is still an incomplete understanding of the early disease mechanisms of Huntingtons disease.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited human neurodegenerative disorder, caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion ( 39 repeats) within the HD gene. As with other polyglutamine diseases, HD is marked by the expression of neuronal intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, containing aggregated expanded huntingtin (htt) and other proteins (Gil and Rego, 2008;Heng et al., 2008). The median age at which HD occurs, is around the age of 40 and the disease progresses over time and is invariably fatal 15-20 years after the onset of the first symptoms (Gil and Rego, 2008). Traditionally, the clinical diagnosis of HD relies upon the presence of abnormal motor signs in a person at risk for HD by virtue of having an affected parent (Aylward, 2007). Currently, the formal diagnosis of HD is confirmed by gene testing (Tabrizi et al., 2009). However, to date, it remains challenging to define early biomarkers that predict the onset of the disease.\nSince the discovery of the HD gene in 1993, a variety of genetic models, such as transgenic mice (Ferrante, 2009;Heng et al., 2008), a lentiviral rat model (de Almeida et al., 2002) and recently a lentiviral non-human primate model (Lundberg et al., 2008) have been generated (Heng et al., 2008;Ramaswamy et al., 2007). While no animal model replicates all features of HD, they provide an alternative approach to study the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, they provide valuable tools in the development of existing and novel therapeutic strategies. Consequently, the choice of the animal model depends on the scientific questions being asked. However, the small size of the mouse brain, limits its use for noninvasive imaging studies, such as MRI and PET. Both techniques are translational imaging tools, and exquisitely suited to study neuronal substrate changes preceding and underlying the behavioral and pathological phenotype in a non-invasive manner.\nRecently, a transgenic rat model of HD has been developed, carrying 51 CAG repeats (von Horsten et al., 2003). This model exhibits an adult-onset neuropathological phenotype, characterized by motor deterioration and emotional, cognitive decline, starting at the age of 7 and 9 months respectively (Kantor et al., 2006;Nguyen et al., 2006;von Horsten et al., 2003). Interestingly, transgenic HD (TgHD) rats show a significant better motor performance at the age of 1 month, followed by a slow decline of motor function with increasing age (Nguyen et al., 2006). Histopathological alterations include htt aggregation foci in nuclei, cytoplasm, dendrites and spines, axons, synaptic terminals, and mitochondria at the earliest age of 6 months (Bode et al., 2008;Cao et al., 2006;Kantor et al., 2006;Nguyen et al., 2006;Petrasch-Parwez et al., 2007) (Fig. 1).\nDiffusion-based MRI techniques are the only non-invasive techniques that can be applied for studying the pathways and connections of not only the human brain, but also of the rodent brain (Bohanna et al., 2008;Douaud et al., 2009;Rosas et al., 2006;Van Camp et al., 2009, 2010). As it is known that many developmental, aging, and pathological (Nguyen et al., 2006). Onsets of behavioral and cognitive abnormalities are shown. At 1 month of age, a reduced anxiety in TgHD rats was found, as well as an improved motor performance. At 7 months of age, a reduced motor performance was found in TgHD rats, compared to Wt animals. Cognitive impairment was seen in 9month-old TgHD rats. A reduction in striatal D 1 -receptor density was found at the age of 14 months (Bode et al., 2008). A decrease in glucose metabolism as well as decreased D 1 and D 2 receptor binding was reported at the age of 24 months (Bauer et al., 2005;von Horsten et al., 2003). processes of the central nervous system influence the microstructural composition and architecture of the affected tissues, the diffusion of water within these tissues will be altered. Consequently, diffusion weighted MRI and in particular DTI became a powerful probe for characterizing the effects of disease and aging (Alexander et al., 2007;Basser and Jones, 2002;Beaulieu, 2002;Beaulieu and Allen, 1994), and has gained wide acceptance as a tool for studying structural changes in tissue microstructure and connectivity.\nThe reference radiotracer to study D 2 receptor binding is 11 Craclopride and has been used in several PET studies on preclinical HD carriers and HD patients to relate decreased binding potential and the disease severity and onset (Andrews et al., 1999;Feigin et al., 2001;Pavese et al., 2003;Politis et al., 2008;van Oostrom et al., 2005). However, the short half-life of the 11 C isotope limits significantly the number of image acquisitions per radiosynthesis. 18 F-Fallypride is the best characterized fluorinated D 2 D 3 antagonist radioligand, and although often used in clinical studies of psychiatric disorders, to our knowledge, no clinical PET study using 18 F-Fallypride on HD patients has been reported so far. Similarly, the few PET studies on animal models of HD studying D 2 receptor binding, generally used 11 C-raclopride (Ishiwata et al., 2002;Wang et al., 2005), and only a few rodent studies used 18 F-Fallypride (Dalley et al., 2007;Honer et al., 2004;Rominger et al., 2010;Tantawy et al., 2009).\nIn the present study we aimed to further characterize the phenotype of the TgHD rat model using in vivo neuroimaging techniques such as DTI and PET. In addition, we aimed to identify imaging based biomarkers associated with early as well as progressive disease status.",

Rectal temperature was maintained at (37.0  0.5)C using a feedback coupled warm air system (MR-compatible Small Animal Heating System, SA Instruments, Inc.). To immobilize the head in flat-scull position during the MRI experiments, rats were secured in a stereotactic device.\nPET 18 F-FDG and 18 F-Fallypride measurements were performed on the same group of animals. The evening before the 18 F-FDG experiments, animals were fasted overnight. Before and after the 18 F-FDG scans, blood glycemia was measured using a blood glucose monitoring system (AccuChek, Roche, France). All animals were weighed at the day of imaging experiments (Table 1). Under anesthesia (isoflurane, induction 3maintenance 1, administered in 100 O 2 ) an intravenous catheter (Venoflux 25G) was placed in one of the tail veins for intravenous tracer injection. Anesthesia was discontinued after the tracer injection, and animals were placed in their home cages during 1 h to allow the uptake of the radiotracer in the vigil brain.\nAfter 1 h, animals were re-anesthetized using isoflurane (induction 3maintenance 1, administered in 100 O 2 ). Temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at a constant temperature of 37  0.5 C using a heating blanket (Homeothermic Blanket Control Unit, Harvard Apparatus Limited, Edenbridge, Kent, UK). The breathing rate of the animals was visually inspected. The rats head was fixed in flat-scull position using a stereotactic device. Although different stereotactic devices were used for MRI and PET imaging, the rats head was fixed in a similar position, allowing the coregistration of the different imaging modalities.",

Six DWIs (b 800 smm 2 ) along 6 different oblique directions (Basser et al., 1994) and a single unweighted reference image were acquired for a total imaging time of approximately 4 h. All DTI processing was done using conventionally built-in and custom made Matlab functions (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) which was previously described in (Van Camp et al., 2009). Before computing the DT, the DWIs were first co-registered to the non-DW image for each subject using an affine transformation and mutual information as the cost function. A real eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric tensor D defines the matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors e i and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues (λ 1 , λ 2 , and λ 3 ). Further, maps of quantitative invariant diffusion indices were calculated: axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA).\nAs the typical brain structures susceptible for HD pathology are the striatum and the surrounding white matter, we segmented in gray matter, the striatum and the globus pallidus (GP). In white matter, the ROI included the corpus callosum (cc), external (ec) and internal capsule (ic). Using AMIRA software, B 0 -images and DT parametric maps (MD and FA) were used to segment the ROIs for each subject. Volume averaged diffusion parameters were derived for all ROI.",

A significant main age effect (F 1, 3  20.238, p b 0.001), consisting in a gradual decrease with age, a significant main ROI effect which demonstrated significant different RD values in all white matter structures (F 1, 3  130.341, p b 0.001) and a significant genotype effect (F 1, 3  7.992, p  0.007), consisting in higher RD values in TgHD rats was observed. The interaction (agegenotype) (F 1, 3  3.340, p  0.040) revealed a significant effect as well. Post-hoc (3  1 repeated measures) ANOVA per genotype (repeated factor is time) revealed a significant lower RD (p  0.003) for the Wt animals at the age of 12 months, compared to the age of 2 (p  0.003) and 6 months (p  0.004). For the TgHD animals however, a significant decrease in RD was found between the age of 6 and 2 months (p  0.002) and between the age of 12 and 2 months (p b 0.001) (Fig. 4, panel C).",

      "text": "Animal models of HD are extremely valuable to unravel pathological mechanisms, but also for the evaluation of different potential therapeutic strategies. In this context, imaging serves as a pivotal tool between preclinical and clinical research since similar techniques are applied on both animal models and patients. Non-invasive imaging tools are particularly suited to follow the progression of the disease and different clinical studies report on longitudinal follow up of MRI (Aylward et al., 1997;Henley et al., 2006;Paulsen et al., 2008;Sritharan et al., 2010;Weaver et al., 2009) and PET findings (Andrews et al., 1999;Feigin et al., 2001;Pavese et al., 2003;Politis et al., 2008;van Oostrom et al., 2005) in preclinical HD carriers and patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal PET or MRI study on any transgenic animal model of HD has been done so far.",

    "Longitudinal volume changes": {
      "text": "The longitudinal study started with adolescent animals at the age of 2 months, when brain maturation is still in progress, and continued until rats reached the age of 15 months. The evolution in total brain size with aging was similar for both TgHD and Wt animals. During maturation brain size increases as observed in the first phase of the study, and stabilized in the second phase. Both Wt and TgHD animals showed a significant increase in relative ventricular size, though, in Wt animals, this increase was significant between the age of 2 and 12 and between 6 and 12 months for TgHD animals. Surprisingly, in contrast to previous reports on the TgHD rat model (Bode et al., 2008;Cao et al., 2006;Kantor et al., 2006;Nguyen et al., 2006;Petrasch-Parwez et al., 2007) TgHD animals showed systematically smaller ventricles and larger striatal volumes compared to Wt animals. The early phenotype in young transgenic HD rats may also point to the hypothesis of hypercompensation, which has emerged very recently in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Nguyen et al., 2006).\nIt is commonly known that the classic pattern of striatal degeneration is ventricular enlargement, however, smaller ventricular volumes have been reported in preclinical HD gene carriers (Paulsen et al., 2006). In contrast, a recent MR study on the R62 mouse model detected very early atrophy in different brain regions such as cortex and striatum. In general, HD is known for its massive striatal atrophy, resulting in enlarged ventricles followed by cortical and total brain atrophy. These data indicate that the brain atrophy in R62 HD mice is more widely distributed than what is known for human pathology, which may be due to the more aggressive phenotype in this short fragment HD mouse model (Zhang et al., 2010). Additionally, Lerch and colleagues performed a deformation-based analysis of high-resolution postmortem MR scans of the YAC128 mouse model. At the age of 8 months, they reported along with the shrinkage of the striatum, a volume increase in the sensorimotor cortex (Lerch et al., 2008). The concept of aberrant enlarged brain tissue, indicated as pathological enlargement is a phenomenon with increasing recognition and has been documented recently in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (Paulsen et al., 2006). The nature of this phenomenon is not clear, however, the three most likely possibilities are a compensatory response, indications of abnormal brain development, or some type of inflammatory response preceding cell death in a later stage of the disease (Lerch et al., 2008).\nLongitudinal PET imaging study 18 F-Fallypride imaging in the rodent brain requires an acquisition time of at least 90 min (Honer et al., 2004;Tantawy et al., 2009; Yakushev et al., 2010). However, the number of animals per imaging session is then strongly limited in order to avoid mass effects (Jagoda et al., 2004). As a consequence, long scan durations do not allow the study of a large group of animals within a relative short time interval, which was unacceptable for the current multimodal follow up study. Solutions exist in the acquisition of late time point scans, as being performed for other radiotracers (Casteels et al., 2006) or as recently been studied for 18 F-Fallypride (Tantawy et al., 2009). The limitation of this setup is that data cannot be analyzed by absolute quantification and only a relative uptake ratio can be used as an estimate of the binding potential. In a preliminary study we defined that the ratio uptake in the striatum relative to the cerebellum reached a plateau 50 min after injection remaining constant till 90 min of acquisition. Based on these results a time window of 60-90 min was used to evaluate 18 F-Fallypride uptake in the striatum. In mice, Honer et al. reported striatum over cerebellum ratios of 10, already at 25 min after injection. This ratio continued to rise till N12 until it reached a plateau 40 min after injection, and from 40 till 60 min after injection their mean ratio was 12.5  1.5 (Honer et al., 2004). Tantawy et al. demonstrated that the distribution volume ratios (DVR) reached a plateau after 100 min only with an average value of 13.8  0.9 for the 120 min scan. However an overestimation of the DVR was observed when taking into account just the last 60 min scans (Tantawy et al., 2009). Recently Constantinescu performed 90 min scans after 60 min uptake of 18 F-Fallypride in awake animals. They reported average binding potentials (BP ND ) for 18 F-Fallypride of 14.4 in dorsal striatum and 6.8 in ventral striatum (Constantinescu et al., 2011). We opted for the acquisition of short scans at late time points, which allowed us to inject a constant mass over all animals. However this acquisition protocol allowed the calculation of the ratio of the uptake in striatum versus cerebellum only as an approximation of the specific binding of 18 F-Fallypride in the striatum. The results were slightly underestimated but nevertheless comparative to previously reported studies (Yakushev et al., 2010).\nIn addition, autoradiographical validation confirmed that the binding values obtained with PET imaging were reliable. In the present study, it was clear that the 18 F-Fallypride data were inherent to partial volume effects and no different uptake could be demonstrated in TgHD animals, compared to controls. Bauer showed with extensive autoradiographic studies a decrease in D 2 and D 1 receptor binding in the ventral striatum of 24 months old TgHD animals (Bauer et al., 2005). However, Bode and colleagues were unable to demonstrate a decrease in D 2 receptor binding in male TgHD animals at the age of 14 months (Bode et al., 2008). Corresponding to the results of Bode we were unable to show progressive neurodegeneration or neuronal dysfunction of the medium spiny neurons. 18 F-FDG data was influenced by increasing glycaemia values with aging and no differential brain metabolism could be demonstrated between TgHD and Wt animals with aging. Previously Von Hörsten and colleagues reported decreased local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (lCMRGlc) in the whole brain of 24 months old homozygous TgHD animals. SUV values measured in the striatum of TgHD animals did not reveal a significantly decreased glucose metabolism (von Horsten et al., 2003).\nThese data suggest that with the currently used PET tracers and methodological approach, we were not able to pick up pre-symptomatic functional brain changes in adolescent and young adult transgenic rats. Indeed, recently, it has been shown that the estimates of binding potential of the intermediate affinity tracer, 18 F-desmethoxyfallypride was less sensitive to partial volume effects compared to 18 F-Fallypride (Rominger et al., 2010). PET imaging studies in preclinical HD patients using 11 C-raclopride and 18 F-FDG showed decreased D 2 -receptor binding in 50 of the HD carriers, and decreased glucose metabolism in only 33 of the patients (van Oostrom et al., 2005). However, a recent longitudinal PET study showed a decrease in D 2 -receptor binding over time and a constantly decreased glucose metabolism in pre-symptomatic Huntington carriers (Feigin et al., 2001).",

    "Longitudinal DTI study": {
      "text": "Over the last decade, DTI has been used to reveal microstructural changes in the brain of HD patients (Douaud et al., 2009;Mascalchi et al., 2004;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2006;Seppi et al., 2006) due to its excellent image contrast to delineate different white and gray matter structures in human as well as in animal brain. In the present longitudinal study we have demonstrated genotype specific age related changes of the diffusion parameters in white and gray matter structures in TgHD animals.\nBy analyzing different regions affected in HD we have shown temporal changes of DTI parameters. In Wt animals, we observed an increase in FA in both white and gray matter structures over the course of one year, which was due to an increase in AD and a decrease in RD. This simultaneous increase and decrease of AD and RD explains the absence of any significant MD change. Unlike longitudinal human studies of the adult brain, which report increasing MD and decreasing FA values with increasing age (Bhagat and Beaulieu, 2004;Pfefferbaum et al., 2000), the Wt rats in our study did not show the same age related changes in diffusion parameters, which might indicate that the normal aging patterns of rats and humans are not the same.\nWe demonstrated subtle alterations in the micro-structural integrity of the white matter surrounding the striatum (i.e. cc, ec and ic) in the TgHD rat model. Although no significant differences were found between Wt and TgHD animals at any specific time point, repeated measures analyses did reveal significantly different age related changes for MD, AD and RD, but not FA in white matter. MD was increased in the white matter of TgHD at the age of 12 months compared to earlier time points, whilst this parameter remained constant in Wt animals. MD tends to be increased when the extracellular compartment increases. The exact mechanisms responsible for white matter pathology in HD, however remains to be elucidated (Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2003Rosas et al., , 2006)). While, AD changes corresponded to MD changes, RD values decreased with age, which was obvious at the age of 6 months in TgHD animals but only at 12 months in Wt animals. MD changes in TgHD animals were mainly driven by a reduction in RD in the early age stage, which subsequently returned to a baseline and an increase in AD at a later age stage. It should be noted that, opposite changes i.e. decreased AD (i.e. water diffusion parallel to the axonal fibers) and increased RD (i.e. water diffusion perpendicular to the axonal fibers) are likely indicators of axonal damage and myelin injury in white matter (Saatman et al., 2003;Song et al., 2002Song et al., , 2005;;Sun et al., 2005). We demonstrated early diffusion differences in white matter, suggestive for a precursor of pathology or a differential aging effect in TgHD rats. Although HD is mainly considered to be a gray matter disease, atrophy of the subcortical white matter has previously been described (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Paulsen et al., 2006;Rosas et al., 2006). A recent clinical study has observed progressive white matter abnormalities with DTI using a longitudinal within-subjects design. They observed decreased FA values in white matter in preclinical and early HD patients over a period of time of 1 year (Weaver et al., 2009). Moreover, Stoffers and colleagues (Stoffers et al., 2010) also showed reduced anisotropy in the corticospinal tract in pre-HD individuals. However, they also detected changes in many other parts of the white matter skeleton, corresponding to a diverse range of tracts, which suggested that loss of white matter tract integrity was not merely a consequence of gray matter atrophy. To further probe white matter in pre-HD, they also examined RD and AD. Similar to our observations, they found highly localized increases in AD while RD showed widespread increases in pre-HD. The authors suggested that the loss of WM integrity was not due to axonal degeneration, but relates to demyelination. Decreased white matter volumes before the evidence of gray matter atrophy have been reported in pre-clinical HD patients (Ciarmiello et al., 2006). These observations have led to the hypothesis that brain degeneration may begin with myelin abnormalities (Bartzokis et al., 2007;Paulsen et al., 2006;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2003). The possibility that dysregulated myelination is pathogenetic to this disease is also supported by reports that pre-symptomatic HD brains show an increase in the density of oligodendrocytes in the striatum years before striatal atrophy or loss of neurons occurs (Gomez-Tortosa et al., 2001;Myers et al., 1991). Provocatively, demyelination might therefore predate gray matter loss (Stoffers et al., 2010).\nSimilarly to the white matter, a genotype specific age related change in gray matter was observed. At the age of 12 months, an increase in MD was observed in the striatum of TgHD rats. However, in contrast to WM, no significant changes were observed for AD and RD. In line with our findings, previous DTI studies have shown increased MD values in the striatum of HD patients (Douaud et al., 2009;Ishiwata et al., 2002;Rosas et al., 2006;Seppi et al., 2006). This might be due to the expansion of the extracellular space due to cell degeneration, though PET imaging did not prove any striatal atrophy.\nBy quantifying the diffusivity, DTI is providing improved sensitivity and specificity in MR diffusion characterization of neural tissues. Although, it should be noted that in complex diseases such as HD, brain regions might experience an unpredictable combination of demyelination, axon loss, gliosis, and inflammation, which could result in competing influences on the diffusion tensor. Therefore the interpretation of changes in the measured diffusion tensor is complex and should be performed with care (Alexander et al., 2007).",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "We presented a unique multimodal imaging study, aiming to further characterize the TgHD rat model and to identify sensitive and reliable biomarkers associated with early and progressive disease status. The outcome of this longitudinal study was somewhat surprising as it demonstrated a significant differential aging pattern in the TgHD animals involving the striatum and the white matter structures surrounding it. The TgHD rat model did not show a sufficient expression of disease yet until the age of 12 months and therefore presents a mild and protracted neuropathological phenotype. Mapping changes in white matter tracts is presently a major research focus in HD for understanding the underlying pathological deficits. Traditionally, the clinical diagnosis of HD relies upon the presence of abnormal motor signs in a person at risk for HD by virtue of having an affected parent (Aylward, 2007). Currently, the formal diagnosis of HD is confirmed by gene testing (Tabrizi et al., 2009). However, to date, it remains challenging to define early biomarkers that predict the onset of the disease.The best therapeutic option for HD is to start treatment in the asymptomatic phase of the disorder. Transgenic models, which are closely related to human pathology, allow the examination of the onset and further progression of neurodegeneration, neuronal dysfunction, and the development and validation of new potential therapies, using translational tools and complementary techniques. Consequently, the identification of molecular biomarkers associated with disease progression will aid the development of effective therapies. It is far from obvious to link the current observations to typical HD pathogenesis, however it is clear that the mutant htt protein interferes with the aging processes as previously described. Such a differential structural maturation of the brain, already during adolescence, might predict the onset of typical HD pathogenesis. DTI is shown to be a sensitive tool to detect these brain structural reorganization of gray and white matter, in the absence of clear neurological dysfunctioning.",

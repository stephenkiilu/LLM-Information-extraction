    "abstract": "Our goal was to evaluate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for predicting future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in conjunction with AD biomarkers (amyloid PET and AD signature neurodegeneration) in 132 MCI individuals 60 years old with structural MRI, DTI, amyloid PET, and at least one clinical follow-up. We used mixed effect models to evaluate the prognostic ability of fractional anisotropy of genu of the corpus callosum (FA-Genu), as a cerebrovascular disease (CVD) marker, for predicting cognitive decline along with AD biomarkers. We contrasted the value of white matter hyperintensities, a traditional CVD marker as well as FA in the hippocampal cingulum bundle (FA-HCB) with the FA-Genu models. FA-Genu significantly predicted cognitive decline even after accounting for AD biomarkers. WMH was not associated with cognitive decline in the model with WMH and FA-Genu. DTI specifically FA-Genu provides unique complementary information to AD biomarkers and has significant utility for prediction of cognitive decline in MCI.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is often a prodrome of dementia (Petersen, 2009) with a progression rate of 10-15 per year (Bruscoli and Lovestone, 2004;Petersen et al., 2001) and many of those with MCI who progress to AD dementia have elevated levels of Aβ (Quigley, Colloby and OBrien, 2011). Because a significant proportion of variability in progression to dementia from MCI is not explained by brain Aβ levels, there is a need for additional biomarkers to aid in the prediction of future cognitive decline in MCI.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising marker for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (Tu et al., 2017;Williams et al., 2017). Studies have shown that reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) or directionality and increase in overall mean diffusivity (MD) are associated with cognitive decline (Croall et al., 2017;Tuladhar et al., 2015). We recently reported that the FA of the genu of the corpus callosum (FA-Genu) is a useful biomarker of CVD because the loss of microstructural integrity in the genu was associated with worsening of systemic vascular health and cerebrovascular injury even after accounting for AD pathologies (Vemuri et al., 2018). This was supported by several studies that have found disconnection of the white matter (WM) tracts in MCI in the context of CVD (Catani and ffytche, 2005;OSullivan et al., 2001). Our primary aim was to test if poor WM microstructural health, as captured by FA-Genu, was predictive of faster cognitive decline and to evaluate its clinical utility in the presence of AD biomarkers (amyloid and neurodegeneration).\nUsing DTI, we investigated the interrelationships between FA-Genu, amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration (cortical thickness in AD signature regions) and cognitive decline among MCI participants, aged 60 years and older, and enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). In addition, we also compared the effectiveness of DTI measures from a different region, FA in the hippocampal cingulum bundle (FA-HCB), a tract that has been known to be vulnerable to AD pathology.",

The diffusion data were preprocessed using the in-house developed pipeline. Briefly, the images were skull stripped (Reid et al., 2018), denoised (Veraart et al., 2016), corrected for head motion and eddy current distortion (Andersson et al., 2016), Gibbs ringing (Kellner et al., 2016), and then Rician noise bias correction was performed (Koay et al., 2009). Diffusion tensors were then fitted by nonlinearly minimizing the squared residuals (Garyfallidis et al., 2014), and FA and MD maps were calculated from the tensors. Advanced normalization tools -Symmetric Normalization (ANTS-SyN) (Avants et al., 2011) was used to non-linearly register FA image of the JHU Eve atlas to each participants FA image (Oishi et al., 2009) and the median values of FA in each region were obtained.

The models were fit with random intercepts and slopes. We did not test for three way interaction because of limited power. Among the three separate models for our predictors of interest, we compared the goodness-of-fit using Akaike information criteria (AIC). Lower AIC suggests greater prediction of variance in the data. The non-significant terms were removed from the model one at time, accounting for nested effects, until the final parsimonious models were reached. All models were tested and controlled for within-subject autocorrelation of the repeated measures.\nThe final parsimonious model included all main effects as well as all significant two-way interactions of potential predictors with time. We tested specifically for: interactions of the DTI imaging biomarker, other imaging biomarkers (PIB and cortical thickness), education occupation, age and time.

In the model of FA-Genu alone, age was a predictor of baseline cognitive performance and had a faster rate of cognitive decline. Sex was not a significant predictor of cognition in any of the models and dropped out from further analysis. In model 3, all three biomarkers (FA-Genu, PIB, and cortical thickness) significantly predicted the rate of cognitive decline (p0.05). The significant interaction between FA-Genu and time indicated that MCI participants with higher FA declined more slowly over time. In the third model with all three imaging predictors, the AIC was lower providing evidence that including all imaging predictors improved prediction of longitudinal cognition. A plot of predicted global cognition categorized by the imaging biomarkers and a spaghetti plot of global cognition as a function of age are shown in Figures 1.

Older age significantly predicted faster rate of annual cognitive decline in models with FA-HCB alone and model 2 (FA-HCB with PIB). FA-HCB had significant interactions with sex and PIB in model 2. FA-HCB predicted cognitive decline (interaction with time) only in models 1 and 2. In the third model (FA-HCB, PIB and cortical thickness), only PIB and cortical thickness but not FA-HCB significantly predicted the longitudinal rate of cognitive decline. However there were significant interactions of FA-HCB with PIB and FA-HCB with baseline age in model 3.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The present study aimed to examine the utility of DTI imaging for predicting cognitive decline in MCI individuals over 60 years of age in conjunction with brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. The major findings of this population based study are as follows:(1) FA-Genu was significantly associated with cognitive rate of decline in MCI individuals even after adjusting for information provided by amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration; (2) FA-HCB was not significantly associated with cognitive rate of decline after adjusting for amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration; and (3) only FA-Genu and not WMH was associated with cognitive decline when the model contained both WMH and FA-Genu. DTI is a promising biomarker for studying the integrity of WM in MCI. Here, we found a significant association between WM structural integrity, measured by FA-Genu, and cognitive decline among MCI participants. Importantly, this association was independent of PIB and cortical thickness, supporting its utility as a biomarker in MCI.\nThe well-defined mechanism of cognitive impairment is that of cortical disconnection (Catani and ffytche, 2005;Lamar et al., 2008) which has been suggested to be influenced by CVD (Croall et al., 2017;Tu et al., 2017;Tuladhar et al., 2015). The CC is the largest WM tract in the brain and plays a crucial role in interhemispheric communication. The loss of these connections can disrupt connectivity of several cortical regions and recognized in age related cognitive declines (OSullivan et al., 2001). These WM changes can therefore be the underlying cause of widespread cognitive impairment in CVD characterized by predominant dysfunction in attention, psychomotor speed, and executive function.\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate the relationship between frontal lobe damage and vascular disease (Knopman et al., 2015;Tullberg et al., 2004) suggesting that the genu of the CC is the most susceptible region to vascular disease effects. Further, FA-Genu was found to capture early changes due to systemic vascular health which lends itself as a useful CVD biomarker in MCI (Vemuri et al., 2018). As reported in prior studies (Croall et al., 2017;Vemuri et al., 2018), FA is a sensitive marker of CVD. We did not investigate MD here because it measures overall water diffusion and may be less specific to subtle microstructure WM abnormalities due to CSF contamination (CSFC). The contribution of partial volume effect due to CSFC has been found more problematic in brain structures with close proximity of ventricles such as the fornix and the genu of CC (Concha et al., 2005;Jones and Cercignani, 2010). Additionally, a greater CSFC for the diffusivity measurements than FA was demonstrated previously in the fornix of the older adults (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012) and genu of CC in the MCI subjects (Berlot et al., 2014).\nMultiple studies have documented CC atrophy in clinically diagnosed MCI and AD dementia (Elahi et al., 2015;L. Wang et al., 2009), and some have reported predominant atrophy in the anterior part (Thomann et al., 2006;Zhu et al., 2012). However, the CC changes in MCI across studies have not been consistent (Thomann et al., 2006;H. Wang and Su, 2006). A previous Rotterdam Study in MCI patients with CVD found microstructural damage in the genu, internal and external capsule, and periventricular WM, but in those without CVD, deterioration was found along the hippocampal tract (Papma et al., 2014) suggesting that the anterior changes may be more specific to CVD. A consistent DTI change in the genu was also demonstrated in patients with subcortical vascular dementia (Chen et al., 2009) further supporting our use of FA-Genu.\nOne would argue against using a specific tract instead of global DTI measures. For example, data from the participants of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) showed an association between overall DTI measures with cognitive decline, incident MCI, dementia and mortality longitudinally (Power et al., 2019). The same was true in a recent Harvard Aging Brain Study where a global FA measure significantly predicted longitudinal cognitive decline even after adjusting for amyloid level (Rabin et al., 2019). However we specifically chose FA-Genu because other limbic tracts such as hippocampal cingulum and fornix have been observed in preclinical AD (Chao et al., 2013;Gold et al., 2014;Jacobs et al., 2018;Rieckmann et al., 2016), suggesting its relationship with amyloid pathology. The sensitivity analyses we conducted in Table 3 support associations between HCB and AD pathophysiology. With amyloidosis and neurodegeneration in the model (model 3), we did not find any significant interaction between FA-HCB and time. The observed interaction between FA-HCB and PiB suggests that CGH may be a part of the AD pathway (Jacobs et al., 2018). More importantly, measuring FA-Genu we are able to capture the independent effect of vascular disease. We also performed sensitivity analyses using cognitive subdomains which indicated variability in associations across the domains as expected due to the heterogeneity seen in etiology of MCI (supplementary table ).\nEvaluating conventional CVD measures like WMH is important to determine the utility of DTI over traditional measures. Although the modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and BMI are identified in association with WM integrity declines (Wassenaar et al., 2019), measurement of WMH provides the extent of CVD damage. While WMH alone was predictive of cognitive decline, we found that WMH was not predictive of cognitive decline in the combined linear mixed model with FA-Genu in the model. These findings support the independent utility of FA-Genu for predicting cognitive performance in MCI patients aged 60 years and older as it may be able to capture more subtle microstructural damage.\nThe present study has some strengths and limitations. A major strength is the availability of amyloid PET, MRI, and longitudinal cognitive outcomes in a population based sample. There are several limitations. We relied on simple and robust measures (genu FA and global cognitive-z score) to study the relationship between DTI metrics and longitudinal cognitive decline after accounting for AD biomarkers. The small sample size to detect subtle effects such as those with WMH may limit the findings of the study. Highly educated individuals in the cohort may have an influence on the generalizability of this study. There is some regional variability in the etiology of WMH as shown recently (Al-Janabi et al., 2018;Graff-Radford et al., 2019;Weaver et al., 2019) but we only considered global WMH in this work and not regional WMH because global WMH is the typically used CVD measure in most aging and dementia studies. Additionally, newer biophysical modelling methods that may allow for robust metrics such as NODDI (Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging) and Free Water Elimination (FWE) may be helpful in providing better metrics of WM integrity and will be part of future investigations. In contrast to DTI, these techniques could reliably account for the partial volume effects by CSFC and therefore provide better sensitivity even in the asymptomaticpreclinical stages.",

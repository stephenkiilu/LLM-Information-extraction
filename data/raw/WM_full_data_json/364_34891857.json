    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease that is associated with cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional disconnection. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to investigate the integrity and degeneration of white matter in AD. In this study, with one of the worlds largest DTI biobanks (865 individuals), we aim to explore the diagnosis utility and stability of tractbased features (extracted by automated fiber quantification (AFQ) pipeline) in AD. First, we studied the clinical association of tract-based features by detecting AD-associated alterations of diffusion properties along fiber bundles. Then, a binary classification experiment between AD and normal controls was performed using tract-based diffusion properties as features and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier with an independent site cross-validation strategy. The average accuracy of 77.90 (the highest was 88.89) showed that white matter properties as biomarkers had a relatively stable role in the clinical diagnosis of AD. Clinical Relevance-White matter characteristics are valid and robust biomarkers of AD, which have high accuracy and generalizability in the AD diagnosis in a large multi-site dataset.",

    "I. INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with cognitive decline, which brings a huge burden to both family and society 1,2. Numerous studies have concluded that effective disease control benefits from early diagnosis and intervention, which gives a research priority to the biomarker searching for early diagnosis of AD 3,4.\nSeveral studies have shown that white matter (WM) impairment is a part of the pathological cascade in AD 5,6. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide quantitative measurement of WM fiber trend and damage degree, providing valuable information for WM lesions. Among DTI analysis methods, automated fiber quantification (AFQ) has shown certain advantages in processing large-scale data efficiently and detecting detailed information based on the points along fiber bundles automatically 7,8. Thus AFQ has been used to study the tracts alterations in several neurogenic diseases including AD 9101112. Dou and colleagues had introduced the AFQ method to study the WM alterations in AD and explored the potential possibility of using WM indices to classify AD from normal controls (NC) 12. But this study was based on a small data set thus lacked persuasiveness. For searching imaging biomarkers with potentiality in the clinical application of AD, it is of great significance to use cross-validation based on large-scale multi-site databases to improve the generalizability of the algorithmic models. Hereby, the current study aims to use a large-scale multisite dataset to investigate the clinical validity and stability of the tract abnormal patterns using a consistent analysis pipeline, as well as to study the diagnosis ability and generalizability of WM features in classifying AD from NC among different sites.\nFor this purpose, in the current study, based on a multi-site dataset with a total of 865 subjects (321 ADs, 265 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, 279 NCs), firstly, we tested the clinical association of the tract-based features extracted via AFQ through a meta-analysis, which was to detect pointwise differences between AD and NC groups of diffusion parameters (fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial diffusivity (AxD)), followed by correlation analysis between these parameters and the score of cognitive status (mini-mental state examination (MMSE)) in the MCI plus AD groups. Secondly, ADs and NCs were binary classified using tract-based properties as features and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier with independent site cross-validation to estimate the diagnosis utility and generalizability of tract-based features in AD.",

      "text": "Images of all datasets were processed by the following procedures. Firstly, DICOM files were transformed to the Nifti images. Then, the DWI images were processed for routine dtiInit preprocessing pipeline in the VISTASOFT package (version 1.0, https:github.comvistalabvistasoft) containing eddy current correction, head motion correction, skull stripping, and tensor model fitting. Secondly, the AFQ pipeline (version 1.2, https:github.comyeatmanlabAFQ) 7 was used to quantify diffusion parameters (FA, RD, MD, AxD) and morphometric characteristics (fiber core linearity values, curvature, torsion, volume) at 100 points along the 18 major white matter tracts, the names of these tracts including bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), corticospinal, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), arcuate, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), cingulum cingulate, thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, minor and major callosum forceps.\nDue to complex factors such as data quality, there is no guarantee of the recognition of all 18 fiber bundles for each subject using AFQ. Thus, during the quality control step, subjects with no more than 14 fiber bundles identified were excluded from the subsequent analysis. Consequently, 825 subjects (276 NCs, 255 MCIs, 294 ADs) were included for further analysis (Table Ⅱ). In addition, curvature and torsion were excluded from subsequent analysis due to excessive missing values.",

    "C. Group-level Pointwise Meta-analysis": {
      "text": "The clinical association of tract-based features was investigated by detecting reliable differences of these features between the AD and NC groups and the relationship with cognitive states. First, we performed a pointwise analysis of the diffusion metrics along 100 points of each fiber tract at a group level (AD and NC). After controlling age and gender effects, a random-effects meta-analysis (R, meta-package, version 4.9-7) was used to combine effect sizes (Cohens d) of 7 cohorts for each diffusion property and each point along the right and left tracts separately. Points with P0.01 (FDR corrected) and fiber tracts with at least 10 continuous and uninterrupted significant points were considered statistically significant between AD and NC groups.\nThen, we calculated the Pearsons correlation coefficients to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability scores (MMSE) and diffusion parameters that were averaged over the intervals with significant differences (results of meta-analysis) at each major tract in the MCI plus AD groups (P0.005, uncorrected).",

    "D. Classification": {
      "text": "After verifying the clinical validity of tract-based features through meta-analysis and correlation analysis, we performed classification experiments to evaluate the discriminant and generalization performance of tract-based features in AD diagnosis. We used tract-based properties extracted via AFQ as features and SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel (python 3.7, Scikit-learn package 0.21.2) as a classifier to achieve a binary classification task (276 NCs and 294 ADs). Specifically, we first reduced the feature dimension from 10802 (18fibers100points6metrics (FA, MD, RD, AxD, fiber core linearity values and volume)  age and gender  10802) to 1082 by applying a 10-point-average smooth strategy to tract-based features. Then, for the outer loop, we adopted a leave-one-site-out cross-validation strategy which means that one site data was selected as the testing set for each loop, data from the rest of the sites were the training set. Within the inner-loop, we used the training set to search optimal model parameters for SVM (penalty parameter C of the error term and RBF kernel coefficient γ) using grid search method with 3-fold cross-validation (the default fold number in Scikitlearn package 0.21.2) (Fig. 2A) 14. Lastly, Accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance. Besides, Pearsons correlation between the classifier output (decision function score) and MMSE was calculated to find the clinical relevance of classification. In particular, the absolute value of the decision function score represents the credibility of prediction and the greater absolute value means higher credibility. The sign of the decision function score represents the predicted class (plus sign represents AD and minus sign represents NC).\nIn addition, considering the heterogeneity of DTI data from different sites, we harmonized the tract-based features with the Combat method (combat tool, sva package, version 3.34.0 in R) 15 and then performed the classification task in the same way as a supplementary experiment. We also used XGBoost and linear kernel SVM as classifiers to repeat the experiment to study the feature importance scores.",

    "A. Meta-analysis of Pointwise Differences along Tracts Showed the Clinical Validity of the Tract-based Features": {
      "text": "Meta-analysis results showed that differences between AD and NC groups widely existed in tract-based features, and the diffusion properties of the discrepant loci were significantly correlated with cognitive status, thus demonstrating the clinical validity of the features (Fig. 1). From the meta-analysis, compared with NC, the AD group presented widely lower FA (10 tracts), fiber core linearity (12 tracts) and volume (8 tracts), and higher MD (18 tracts), RD (16 tracts) and AxD (14 tracts). The alteration patterns were similar but MD and RD were more sensitive to identify the alterations than other metrics. Bilateral cingulum, IFOF, uncinate fasciculus, and callosum forceps showed significant differences. The two fiber bundles that not only had a significant difference on all indicators but also had the largest effect size in FA were left cingulum cingulate (the largest Cohens d in FA-0.86, P1.3e-07, shown as Fig 1 left) and callosum forceps minor (the second-largest Cohens d in FA  -0.79, P1.6e-08, shown as Fig. 1 right). However, in the left corticospinal, FA was significantly higher in AD group with a relatively lower effect size (Cohens d0.57, P6.7e-06).\nCorrelation coefficients between the mean feature values of the locations with significant differences along significant tracts and MMSE showed commonly strong relevance (the absolute value of r ranging from 0.12 to 0.31). The strongest correlation averaged of all indicators was found on the callosum forceps minor (mean absolute r0.25, r in FA0.24, P1e-04). The left cingulum cingulate also shown a strong correlation in FA (r0.25, P1e-04).",

But the performances varied across sites, which may be caused by the different data distributions across sites (Fig. 2C).",

    "CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE": {
      "text": "Correlation analysis showed that the decision function score in the AD group was negatively associated with MMSE (r-0.32, P1e-04, Fig. 2B). While as for the MCI group, the correlation coefficient was only -0.18 (P0.005), manifesting that the classification output could represent the severity of cognitive impairment in the AD group but the predictive performance was limited in the MCI group.\nConsidering the site heterogeneity, we used the harmonized tract-based features processed via Combat to do the same experiment. Generally, data distribution differences between sites were reduced a lot (Fig. 2C). As Fig. 2D shown, the accuracies of sites with poor performance based on original data were greatly improved (S02, S03, S07) and the average performance was enhanced from ACC of 77.90 to 79.78 (AUC of 0.86 to 0.89). Besides, the performances of all sites were more balanced. The correlation between decision function and MMSE in AD group remained stable (r-0.33). Classification using XGBoost and linear kernel SVM showed similar performance (XGBoost: average AUC of original features  0.85, average AUC of harmonized features  0.87. linear SVM: average AUC of original features  0.85, average AUC of harmonized features  0.85). The tracts with higher average feature importance scores were left corticospinal, bilateral cingulum, callosum forceps, and uncinate fasciculus, enhancing the findings from the metaanalysis. We have also tried tri-classifications, but the results are limited with the best accuracy of only 55.20. More detailed results can be found in 13.",

    "IV. DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Our study demonstrated the stability and generalizability of tract-based features extracted by AFQ in AD diagnosis, confirming the clinical utility of white matter parameters as biomarkers for AD. The advantage of our study is that, based on a large-scale multi-site dataset, the extensive lesions of WM fibers in AD were verified by meta-analysis, and the generalizability and stability of WM features in diagnosis were quantificationally measured by independent site crossvalidation strategy, which made our results more credible and convincing.\nFrom the perspective of the clinical significance of tractbased features, in line with previous studies 11,12, WM alterations appeared widely in AD. And most of the changes were significantly correlated with the cognitive status in AD plus MCI groups, demonstrating a strong clinical basis of our findings. Among all the fiber tracts, the cingulum cingulate and callosum forceps have been confirmed to be most strongly associated with structural degeneration and impaired cognitive function in AD. Particularly, cingulum cingulate were found to be compromised in the early stage of AD 16. The corpus callosum connects the two brain hemispheres and plays key roles in high-level associative connectivity 17,18. Hereby, meta-analysis enhanced the reliability of our results. Besides, the results of the meta-analysis are similar to the feature importance from classifiers, which can mutually verify.\nMining effective biomarkers play a vital role in the individualized treatment of AD. One of the great advantages of the present study is that the classifiers achieved high ACC with the leave-site-out independent cross-validation. This cross-validation strategy can not only reduce overfitting but also effectively quantify the generalizability of features and models across sites 14,19. According to the classification results, although the average performance was mediocre (ACC77.90), the accuracies of the top three were higher than 80, illustrating that tract-based features were effective in AD diagnosis. Amid the trend to use large-scale multisite datasets to boost statistical power, heterogeneity between sites is an inevitable problem for the reason of diverse acquisition conditions and processing pipelines (as shown in Fig. 2C). According to the classification results, the ACC of different sites was not balanced (the top was higher than 80 but the lowest was under 70). The reasons for the site-dependent accuracies are complex. On the one hand, the accuracy of diagnosis (i.e., the real labels in classification) is one reason. Sites with accurate labels (e.g., S01, S06 collected by specialists), have higher classification accuracies. Improving the precision of labels is of great significance in building computer-aided diagnostic models. On the other hand, heterogeneity caused by the manufacturer may be one reason. The worst categorized site (S02) was the only one of the seven sites to use GE machines, and its data distribution deviated significantly from the other sites (Fig. 2C left), indicating that using data collected by different manufacturers requires more care. Among harmonization methods, ComBat has been confirmed to be an outstanding tool to reduce site heterogeneity meanwhile remain the biological information 15,20. In the classification experiment, the average ACC and AUC have been slightly improved and the accuracy of the site with poor performance has been enhanced after using ComBat, indicating the advantage of harmonization in classification. However, the disadvantage of ComBat is that it cannot deal with data from new sites which are very common in real applications 15. In addition, the stability of performance improvement of the harmonization method among different algorithms remains to be further evaluated. Thus, how to combine the data from different sites and develop a computer-aided diagnostic model without site usage restriction is still a big challenge.",

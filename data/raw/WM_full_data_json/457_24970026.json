    "abstract": "Imaging markers derived from magnetic resonance images, together with machine learning techniques allow for the recognition of unique anatomical patterns and further differentiating Alzheimers disease (AD) from normal states. T1-based imaging markers, especially volumetric patterns have demonstrated their discriminative potential, however, rely on the tissue abnormalities of gray matter alone. White matter abnormalities and their contribution to AD discrimination have been studied by measuring voxel-based intensities in diffusion tensor images (DTI); however, no systematic study has been done on the discriminative power of either region-of-interest (ROI)-based features from DTI or the combined features extracted from both T1 images and DTI. ROI-based analysis could potentially reduce the feature dimensionality of DTI indices, usually from more than 10e  5, to 10-150 which is almost equal to the order of magnitude with respect to volumetric features from T1. Therefore it allows for straight forward combination of intensity based landmarks of DTI indices and volumetric features of T1. In the present study, the feasibility of tract-based features related to Alzheimers disease was first evaluated by measuring its discriminative capability using support vector machine on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps collected from 21 subjects with Alzheimers disease and 15 normal controls. Then the performance of the tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined feature was evaluated by cross-validation. The combined feature yielded good classification result with 94.3 accuracy, 95.0 sensitivity, 93.3 specificity, and 0.96 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The tract-based FA and the tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined features are certified their feasibilities for the recognition of anatomical features and may serve to complement classification methods based on other imaging markers.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia that causes memory loss and abnormal behaviors. A definite diagnosis can be made only through autopsy after death by measuring the density of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles. Clinical criteria for AD are usually based on neurological examination and psychometric assessment. Neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), add positive value for AD diagnosis by detecting structural or functional markers at the early stage 1.\nPrevious studies employed group-wise analyses of MR images of AD and normal control (NC) to establish structural biomarkers for AD discrimination. Some of these studies employed voxel-based morphometry maps statistic differences of gray matter on a voxel-by-voxel basis 2345. Other studies were based on volumetricthickness measurements of regions of interest (ROI) obtained by manual delineation or automated segmentation 67891011. Both voxel-based and ROI-based techniques show consistent atrophy distributed over brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal gyrus, etc. Other studies used the shape of a single priori ROI, such as the hippocampus, and characterized the ROI as a series of parameters like spherical harmonics or log-Jacobian determinant from tensor-based morphometry 12,13. Apart from inter-group studies, methods that are capable of utilizing information from the above voxelROIshape-based features are used for the classification of a single subject. Many studies have demonstrated that machine learning techniques, specifically support vector machine (SVM), are useful for exploring a hyperplane or hypersurface among high dimensional training features and the categorization of a testing subject as a member of a particular clinical group 1415161718. These techniques potentially help with differentiating AD from normal states or ruling out alternative causes of dementia.\nApart from morphometric measurements, other imaging modalities have also been developed as biomarkers for AD Identification, such as electroencephalography (EEG), PET, and DTI 19202122. DTI, in particular, allows for the measurement of white matter integrity which was demonstrated to be consistent with pathological axonal structures in AD patients 23,24. White matter tract integrity was monitored by two frequently used indices derived from DTI, namely fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). It has been reported that FA shows a lower signal and MD shows a higher signal in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, cingulate, corpus callosum, and temporal lobe white matter of AD patients 25262728. These patterns based on FA or MD could derive voxel-based imaging marker for AD discrimination 22,29,30. Moreover, numerous statistical studies have investigated the white matter structural damage specifically related to the atrophied gray matter area in AD 313233343536. Consequently, lots of studies reported the feasibility of extracting voxel-based features from DTI or building disease-specific filtering from both T1 and DTI for anatomical feature recognition 22,29,30, but no systematic study has attempted to determine the discriminative power of ROI-based features built from DTI indices alone or from the combination of both DTI indices and volumetric patterns. ROI-based analysis could potentially reduce the feature dimensionality of DTI indices, usually from more than 10e  5, to 10-150 which is almost equal to the order of magnitude with respect volumetric features. Therefore, a major advantage of using the ROI-based features is that it allows for straight forward combination of intensity based landmarks of DTI indices and volumetric features of T1 since both strategies intend to characterize an ROI with one single value.\nWhite matter is composed of bundles of axons that carry nerve impulses between neurons. The best natural parcellation strategy would be the tract-by-tract labeling of white matter because it groups pixels sharing the same anatomical features and same functions. Previous study applied tract-based voxel grouping, such as tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) 37, to find out disease-specific abnormalities for AD discrimination 29. This data-driven approach, in fact, implemented a whole-brain voxel clustering within the tract skeleton that abandoned the accurate anatomical definition. Therefore, tractby-tract analysis in this case is not applicable since the lack of appropriate ROI definition to capture single-variable characterization within one certain white matter structure. This TBSS-based analysis is potentially reduced to a voxel-wise analysis that, though was effective for AD discrimination, was not applicable for the feature combination of DTI indices and volumetric features. In the present study, anatomical labels were generated for each of the 36 subjects using a probabilistic tract atlas 38 and a brain mapping tool. In the atlas set, each tract was reconstructed under anatomical constraints thereby clustering voxels with similar anatomical structures.\nThe tract-based feature extracted from DTI has similar order of magnitude to the volumetric features of gray matter thereby allowing for the straight forward combination of ROI-based imaging markers from both atrophy pattern in gray matter and intensity based abnormalities in white matter. This multivariate description is important because it encodes both white matter and gray matter character within ROIs. It could be extended to be a tool for anatomical feature recognition and may serve to complement information based on other biomarkers.",

Briefly, twenty-one patients diagnosed with probable AD by the Alzheimers criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) 40 (MF  1110, mean age  66.8  10.4 y, MMSE  17.5  3.6) and 15 healthy individuals with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders (MF  87, mean age  65.3  7.3 y, MMSE  28.5  0.7) were recruited from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Subjects with structural abnormalities that could produce dementia, such as cortical infarction, tumor or subdural hematoma; or who had undergone treatment or had a concurrent illness other than dementia that interfered with cognitive function at the time of MRI scan were excluded. All the subjects underwent DTI on a 3.0 T MR system (SignaHDxt, GE Healthcare, USA) with a TRTE of 1000083 ms, flip angle of 90, matrix of 256  256, FOV of 240 mm  240 mm, phase FOV of 1, slice thickness of 3.0 mm with no space, NEX of 1, total slice of 42, and b value of 1000 smm 2 along 30 directions. A 3D fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) sequence covering the whole brain was used for structural data acquisition with TRTEinversion time (TI) 6.52.1400 ms, FOV 256 mm  256 mm, phase FOV 1, matrix 256  256, slice thickness 1.0 mm, slice gap 0 mm, number of signal averages (NEX) 1, flip angle 15, scan time 4 min 8 sec.\nThe raw diffusion tensor images were first co-registered to the b0 images and corrected for eddy current and subject motion with affine transformation using automated image registration 41. The six elements of the diffusion tensor were calculated for each pixel by multivariate linear fitting using DTIstudio 42. After diagonalization, three eigen values (λ 1 , λ 2 , and λ 3 ) and eigen vectors (v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 ) were obtained. For the description of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated according to 43.",

    "Probabilistic white matter tract atlas": {
      "text": "The reconstruction of probabilistic white matter tract atlas was described in detail in a previous study 38. Briefly, 20 healthy subjects (36.4  13.3 years old of age; 10 males, 10 females; righthanded) underwent whole brain fiber tracking using fiber assignment by continuous tracking 44. The well-defined white matter tracts were reconstructed on each subject using an automated replacement of ROIs that were pre-defined on a DTI-based atlas call ICBM-152 45. These ROIs specified the destinations (start region and end region) of the white matter bundle which were used for selecting fibers according to anatomical constraints. In addition, NOT ROIs were defined for eliminating false positive fibers, namely, fibers that satisfy the AND constraints but extend or merge into another white matter bundle due to artifacts. Following the ROI definition, fibers that penetrated its two destinations and avoided the NOT areas were assigned to the specific tract of interest associated with those ROIs. Affine and dual-channel LDDMM 46,47 were employed to accurately map the ROIs from the atlas space to the subject space. To create the probabilistic coordinates of various white matter tracts over 20 subjects, the reconstructed tracts, in the form of streamline coordinates, were first converted to binary image files (1: voxels that contain the tracts, 0: the remaining voxels), then transformed to the atlas space using the LDDMM forward transformation matrices. The binary files from the 20 normal subjects were averaged to create probabilistic maps in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates. The tract atlas defined one hundred and eighteen tracts and was incorporated into ROIeditor which can be downloaded from the Website (www.mristudio.org). Forty-seven tracts that were well-described in previous literature were used for feature extraction in this study and are listed in Table 1. Note that the DTI data for atlas generation were acquired at the University of California Los Angeles under the International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) collaboration 48. It is a different group of subjects from the one that was used for discriminative analysis in the present study.",

    "Tract-based FA": {
      "text": "The reason for choosing FA over MD for white matter description is that FA is a non-unit index and was proven to have higher reproducibility and smaller bias than MD within and across scanners 49. Thus, a more unbiased characterization of white matter could be obtained using FA-based features especially when the subject is categorized from a different scanner. The regional feature is extracted from the tract of interest (TOI) by superimposing the tract atlas onto the FA maps of the target subjects (21 AD  15 NC). To match the same anatomic structure with the subject, the tracts were warped to the subject space using backward transformation matrices generated from affine and LDDMM registration between the subjects and the atlas. Suppose one of the probabilistic tract map that has been transformed to the subject space is denoted by P i (x) (i  1, 2, 3,, 47), the i th feature extracted from this subject is calculated by:\nwhere x is the index of image pixels. Thus, the overall feature for one subject is a 47-dimension vector:\nAs shown in (1), f i is equal to the weighted average of FA within the area covered by the tract. For one pixel x, the weight reflects the probability of the existence of the tract within x, where the probability is obtained by evaluating the coverage rate of tracts on x over a normal population.\nComparing with the voxel-wise feature, this tract-based feature reduces the feature dimensionality by tightening the cluster of pixels sharing the same structure and performing the same functions and also filters out image noises or redundant pixels that have no contribution to discrimination.",

Similar to the method introduced in 22, the masked FA indices were listed in a row vector which was then directly used as feature. There are three major differences between the present study and Ref. 22. Firstly, in Ref. 22, the white matter mask was derived from the average of segmentation maps of the fifty-four T1 images. The present study used an atlas whose white matter was manually defined. Secondly, compared to the present study, Ref. 22 employed an extra step of feature selection following Plants approach 50.

    "Validation of proposed features": {
      "text": "Overall, four types of features were studied and compared in this work, including tract-basedvoxel-based FA, gray matter volumes extracted from T1 and tract-based FA  gray matter volumes extracted from both T1 and FA. Special focus was put on tractbased FA since there was no systematic analysis of it. A 36  47 feature matrix was built by performing feature extraction over 36 subjects. Classification performance was improved by determining the low dimensional features with maximum discrimination power using principal component analysis (PCA) and selecting the first four sorted eigen values (principal component) that comprise 95 of the total load. The compressed feature is characterized as the training data and was sent to the SVM program 51 along with their clinical labels (AD  positive  1, NC  negative  0). The purpose of SVMs is to find the maximum-margin hyperplane that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes in the feature space. An unbiased estimate of true classification performance was obtained by employing one of the cross-validation approaches known as leave-one-out (LOO). This procedure iteratively leaves one subject out of training for subsequent testing until each of the 36 subjects has been validated. Note that PCA is also inside the LOO loop; that is, the testing sample did not participate in PCA but had its dimension reduced by multiplying the eigen vector generated by the PCA of training samples. The classification model was constructed and tested following the protocol outlined in Fig. 1. The same protocol was applied to voxel-based FA for comparison where the feature dimension was compressed to 12 where the greatest discriminative power was found. Different classifiers, sample sizes or different error estimators produce different biases and variances. Cross-validation is well known for its unbiased estimation of classification errors, especially in small sample tests. However, it is also know to produce large variability 52. It is indicated by Ref. 53 that choosing high k value (the number of folds for cross-validation) usually results in lower bias, higher variance estimators. Therefore, the LOO makes the variance of estimated errors even larger because k is maximized (equals to the sample size) in this case. The error variances according to different k were studied to examine whether they were below an acceptable level. Note that the error was defined as 0-1 loss (error  0 when predicted label  real label; error  1 when predicted label  real label) in the present study.\nFeature dimension of each subject was further extended to 142 after concatenating the tract-based FA (47-D) and gray matter volumes (95-D). The combined features were first normalized by calculating the Z-score of every element of the training features. Normalized features were then compressed by PCA and sent to SVMs for training and testing through the same LOO procedure. The classification accuracies of the four approaches were compared in terms of classification accuracy (percentage of correctly classified subjects), specificity, sensitivity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 54, as well as the area under the ROC curve (AUC), where AUC  0.5 stands for completely random predictions and AUC  1.0 stands for perfect separation 55.",

    "Results": {
      "text": "For DTI-based analysis, 88.9 of the subjects were correctly assigned to the diagnostic category with LOO using tract-based FA, whereas 83.3 were assigned correctly using voxel-based FA. For model using gray matter volumes alone, 88.3 were assigned correctly. For the tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined model, 94.3 of the subjects were assigned correctly. Note that the dimensionality of each type of feature was reduced to p where the best classification performance was found. Specifically, p  4 for tract-based FA, p  12 for voxel-based FA, p  4 for gray matter volumes and p  22 for tract-based FA  gray matter volumes. Fig. 2 shows the variations of classification accuracies with the increase of p.\nFig. 3 shows the variances of errors estimated by crossvalidations with all possible fold numbers (k  2,3, 4,,36) for the four types of features. To make the results comparable, p was fixed at 4 for each type of feature to exclude the influence from feature dimensionality. Obviously, variances were found a trend of rising with the increase of k. In particular for LOO (k  36), voxelbased FA produced the largest variance (0.18) while the other three features yielded lower variances (0.107  0.006).\nFigs. 4 and 5 display the ROC curves (Fig. 4) as well as the roseplot of sensitivityspecificity from the methods using tract-based FA (Fig. 5a), voxel-based FA (Fig. 5b), gray matter volumes from T1 (Fig. 5c) and tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined features (Fig. 5d). A matlab tool box was used for the visualization of these results 54,56. Fig. 5a and b demonstrated that the tractbased FA performed better for the discrimination of AD from NC, achieving 6.7 higher accuracy, 8.4 higher specificity, and 1.9 larger AUC than voxel-based FA. These two types of feature performed equally well for sensitivity. In addition, all indicators suggest that the tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined model produced higher accuracyspecificitysensitivity than the model using these two features alone.\nAlthough tract-based FA performed as well as the voxel-based FA or even better than the voxel-based FA in classification accuracy, the disease-specific pattern for discriminating between normal and AD with respect to tract-based FA still need to be studied. The reason is that from a differential diagnosis point of view AD is not the only disease that reduces FA in white matter. To learn the pattern, the biological sensitivity was investigated by generating the mean feature weights as part of the PCA of the 36 subjects (Fig. 6). The weight for each feature (extracted by a specific tract) was calculated in every LOO procedure, then the mean weight for the same feature was calculated by averaging the weights produced from the 36 iterations. The top 15 features were observed from following the tracts (from highest weight to lowest weight): cingulum of hippocampus right (CGH_R), corpus callosum to superior frontal gyrus (CC_SFG), corpus callosum to middle frontal gyrus (CC_MFG), corpus callosum to gyrus rectus (CC_RG), uncinate fasciculus right (UNC_R), fronto-occipital fasciculus right (IFO_R), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus left (IFO_L), superior longitudinal fasciculusfrontal lobe to temporal lobe right (SLF_FT_R), superior longitudinal fasciculus-frontal lobe to parietal lobe right (SLF_FP_R), corpus callosum to middle occipital gyrus (CC_MOG), corpus callosum to pre-central gyrus (CC_PrCG), corpus callosum to cingulate gyrus (CC_CingG), cingulum of cingulate gyrus left (CGC_L), uncinate fasciculus left (UNC_L), and corpus callosum to lingual gyrus (CC_LG). These tracts are visualized in MNI space in Fig. 7. The volume-based pattern is not studied in this work because it has been discussed in many previous works.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The tract-based FA produced higher classification accuracy and specificity and a larger AUC than the voxel-based FA. The different performances of the two features may be explained by several factors. First, neighboring voxels of the top-PCA-ranked voxels are assumed to encode useful information for classification according to the regional nature of neuron degeneration; however, neither PCA nor SVM utilizes any spatial information of the image in the voxel-based approach. Second, a TOI-based feature tightens the clustering of voxel and reduces dimensionality by grouping voxels with similar anatomic and functional characteristics. Third, the averaging of voxel-wise features within a TOI is an effective filtering procedure that reserves commonly shared features and removes redundancy or noise.\nCompared with gray matter volumes, the tract-based FA perform better in sensitivity but worse in specificity. It is difficult to determine the winner in this case probably because T1 and DTI were segmented via different registration protocols. No matter image quality or the singlemulti-channel difference in LDDMM configuration has large impact on the label boundaries and further the classification result. Compared with the results reported in previous literature using voxelvolumethickness features based on structural MRI (T1), the tract-based FA produced a sensitivity higher than 85.0 57, 86.0 58, 85.0 59, and 82 60 but lower than 92.0 61 and a specificity higher than 85.0 57 and 86.3 58 but lower than 93.0 60. The direct comparison of performance between the proposed method and previous methods based on the sensitivity or specificity obtained from structural MRI could only be a reference since they were evaluated through different protocols; part of the aforementioned approaches were based on ADNI datasets retrieved from different medical centers, whereas the study data in the proposed method came from a single scanner. Models in these previous studies were also trained and tested using different registrationsegmentation approaches or different classifiers; for instance, LP boosting was employed in Ref. 57 and LDA was employed in Ref. 59. Parts of these studies also used a hierarchical fusion classifier with features from multimodal imaging techniques 58. Admittedly, we cannot claim that DTI-based approach performed better than T1-based approach. However, DTI-based features serves as a complementary tool to volume-based features as the two imaging techniques reflect tissue changes associated with AD that correspond to pathological evidences in the gray matter and white matter, respectively. It seems promising to combine these two modalities to generate features with comprehensive description of patients of AD, and it is. The results suggest that the tract-based FA  gray matter volumes-combined model yields better classification accuracy than the model using purely tract-based FA or the model that utilized gray matter volumes alone. It is believed that performance of the classification could make a further approxima-tion to the neurological result when combining with extra features, like examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other imaging modalities. However, this method cannot be extended to an automated diagnosis so far because the real automated diagnosis can be reached unless that training samples are given their true clinical labels which could only be obtained from pathology.\nOne focal point of the present work is to demonstrate the feasibility of the tract-based FA. Apart from the evidence from the classification accuracy, disease-specific pattern is also critical. During dimension reduction of tract-based feature, variables in the feature vector were ranked from highest weight to lowest weight as part of PCA. The weight order is known to indicate the disease-specific pattern of white matter abnormality. In classification, the pattern is capable of avoiding the confusion between AD and other neurodegenerative disease that reduces FA in white matter. Conversely, weights may be argued as less convincing if generated from a single group of training samples. In the present study, we generated the weights 36 times, taking different subgroups as PCA input to certify the reproducibility. Fig. 6 shows that the weight variations are small over the 36 iterations. Among the 15 most discriminative features for classification, CC to SFGMFGRGPrCG, which stands for commissural tracts connecting bilateral frontal areas and penetrating corpus callosum, confirms previous observations of the bilateral decrease of FA in the white matter of the frontal lobe in AD 25. The disruption patterns within the limbic-related white matter areas, including CGH_R and CGC_L, also agree well with previous findings of significantly reduced FA in the cingulum 28,62. FA was also proven to be significantly lower in the UNC_L and UNC_R tracts in AD 63, and these tracts were also determined to have considerate weights in this study. CC_MOG and CC_LG are commissural tracts connecting the bilateral occipital lobe and penetrating the splenium of the corpus callosum, and numerous reports have indicated the importance of splenium in AD monitoring 646566. A high weighted feature extracted by IFO in this study also agrees with a previous finding 67 of a significantly decreased FA in the frontal part of IFO.\nThe rest of the high weighted tracts, including SLF_FT, SLF_FP, and CC_CingG, covered the typical anatomical areas that are involved in AD, as proven by previous studies of white matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus in AD 25262728.",

Besides the accuracy-related results, the biological sensitivity of tract-based FA was also studied as a part of the demonstration of the feasibility. The tract-wise contribution that was found agrees well with previous findings in white matter abnormalities. This biological sensitivity is a key element for SVM to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disease which characterized as FA reduction.

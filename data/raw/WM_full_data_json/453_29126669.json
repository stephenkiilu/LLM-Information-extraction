    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) gained a lot of interest recently, especially that the conversion rate to Alzheimer Disease (AD) in the amnestic subtype (aMCI) is higher than in the non-amnestic subtype (naMCI). We aimed to determine whether and how diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) using the diffusion tensor model (DTI) can differentiate MCI subtypes from healthy subjects. High resolution 3D T1W and DWI images of patients (aMCI, n  18; naMCI, n  20; according to Petersen criteria) and controls (n  27) were acquired at 3T and processed using ExploreDTI and SPM. Voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI) analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were performed with ANCOVA; MD was higher in aMCI compared to controls or naMCI in several grey and white matter (GM, WM) regions (especially in the temporal pole and the inferior temporal lobes), while FA was lower in WM ROI-s (e.g. left Cingulum). Moreover, significant correlations were identified between verbal fluency, visual and verbal memory performance and DTI metrics. Logistic regression showed that measuring FA of the crus of fornix along GM volumetry improves the discrimination of aMCI from naMCI. Additional information from DWIDTI aids preclinical detection of AD and may help detecting early non-Alzheimer type dementia, too.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimer Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the aging population, which is already an enormous but still a growing economic burden in western societies such as countries of the European Union or the United States.\nWhile we do not have effective treatment for AD at the moment, but future interventions will likely be effective in an early stage of the disease, many research efforts are focused on the early detection of symptoms. Converging evidence from many previous investigations revealed that pathologic process of AD starts decades before the first symptoms of cognitive decline (Mattsson et al., 2009). Therefore, the intermediate stage between the mild decrease of cognitive functioning in physiological aging and the severe decline in dementia known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has gained a lot of interest in the last decade. In MCI mild impairment of cognitive skills can be revealed by neuropsychological tests, while global cognitive functions and everyday activities are preserved (Petersen, 2004). The higher conversion rate to AD in MCI gives the clinical significance of this pre-disease condition. The annual conversion rate is 10-15 in MCI compared to the annual rate of 1-4 in the average elderly population; hence most MCI patients develop clinical AD (Bischkopf et al., 2002;Petersen et al., 2001). Further subtypes of MCI can be differentiated such as the amnestic (aMCI) and non-amnestic subtypes (naMCI) with distinct structural features (Csukly et al., 2016). The conversion rate from the aMCI subtype to Alzheimer Disease is much higher (Grundman, 2004) compared to the naMCI subtype, which underlines the significance of differentiation between these subtypes. Patients with the naMCI subtype tend to develop other dementia subtypes (e.g. vascular).\nThough atrophy of grey matter (GM) structures in the medial temporal lobe have been the most studied feature (Chiang et al., 2011;Csukly et al., 2016;Desikan et al., 2009;Serra et al., 2013), degradation of white matter tracts, especially the fornix may precede (de la Monte, 1989;Oishi and Lyketsos, 2014) it and has become detectable in preclinical states with use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and other complimentary imaging techniques (Delano-Wood et al., 2012). Indeed, the cingulum and the fornix carry the axons projecting from the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, and there is published evidence underlining their predictive potential (Kantarci, 2014;Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015).\nDTI is a relatively new, promising neuroimaging technique in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease and in the identification of early at-risk groups such as patients with MCI. Fractional Anisotropy (FA, a measure of the overall directionality of water diffusion), and Mean Diffusivity (MD, a measure of rotationally invariant magnitude of water diffusion) were found to be good indices of fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination, and proved to be useful as early signals of cognitive decline (Kantarci et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2014). FA is greater and MD is decreased in organized white matter tracts, while both measures go to the opposite direction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and disorganized fibers (Fellgiebel and Yakushev, 2011;Stebbins and Murphy, 2009). Findings of previous studies suggest a scheme in MCI and AD where white matter damage begins in the core memory network of the temporal lobe and cingulum and spreads beyond these regions in later stages (ODwyer et al., 2011).\nThe primary aim was to find the possible differences between the subgroups of MCI, which may increase prognostic capability at an early stage, and a further aim was to confirm the recent findings regarding the DTI differences observed between controls and MCI subjects (Kantarci, 2014;Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015). Based on previous evidence (Kantarci, 2014;Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015), the most prominent between group differences and the strongest correlations with memory functions were expected in the cingulum and the fornix. The secondary aim of the study was to determine in which brain regions and DTI measurements can expand the findings of previous volumetric examinations (Csukly et al., 2016), to help the differentiation between patients with aMCI and healthy subjects.",

    "Methods": {
      "text": "Briefly, in this study different statistical approaches were applied to (1) identify those white matter structures which are the most sensitive to early impairment in pathological aging, and (2) to estimate if diffusion metrics can extend the differentiation performance of volumetry. First, we performed voxel-wise correlation analyses between neuropsychological tests and the above mentioned DTI parameters to assess and demonstrate whether these tests capture the examined aspects of cognitive performance and that the DTI metrics under consideration do reflect the state of tissue microstructure in relation to them. Next, we compared subgroups of healthy individuals, and at-risk subgroups of amnestic and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment on the voxellevel to solidify the results of the correlation analyses and identify the regions showing significant between-group differences. With voxellevel calculations being extended to the whole of the brain parenchyma, the earliest signs of alterations in GM cellular structure may be detected. We then performed both correlation and between group analyses in predefined regions of interest (the 48 ROIs of the JHU White-Matter Atlas (Hua et al., 2008;Mori et al., 2008Mori et al., , 2005;;Wakana et al., 2007)). With less independent tests to perform and thereby being able to apply more liberal thresholds for multiple comparisons correction, the ROI-level approach may exhibit higher sensitivity. Even more so, with the method being used on WM ROIs, its results may prove to be more stable (as DTI is most sensitive to changes in the WM), rendering these this approach better suited for discriminative models.\nFinally, In order to prove our hypothesis that DTI measures of these regions can improve the differentiation performance achievable with GM volumetry, logistic regression analysis was performed with a K-fold cross-validation approach (Kohavi, 1995), combining volumetric data from the same patient population (Csukly et al., 2016) with the DTI measures.",

(2016), except for three additional healthy controls.\nBrain DW-MRI images were collected with a single shot SE-EPI sequence, with b  800 smm 2 diffusion weighting in 32 directions and one b  0 image. In-plane resolution was 1.67  1.67 mm; whole brain coverage was achieved with 70 consecutive, 2 mm thick axial slices; TR  9660 ms repetition time, TE  75,6 ms echo time, and 90flip angle was used; the total acquisition time was 8:32 min. High resolution T1 weighted images were also acquired for registration purposes with 1 mm isotropic voxels, using a 3D gradient-echo sequence.\nAll subjects enrolled in the study participated in a cognitive training program announced in a Retirement Home and among general practitioners (The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier is NCT02310620). Demographics of the three groups of subjects are summarized in Table 1. A detailed description of the neuropsychological tests can be found in the Supplements (Supplement A).\nSubjects included in the study were categorized as aMCI, naMCI, and healthy controls according to the Petersen criteria (Petersen, 2004). (Gomar et al., 2011). For the differentiation between aMCI and healthy controls we applied a cutoff score of 1 SD under population mean standardized for age and gender. Participants, who scored under the cutoff value either in the delayed recall subscore or in the total score, was assigned to the aMCI group. The applied criteria are based on the recommendations of the National Institute on Aging -Alzheimers Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimers disease (Albert et al., 2011) (Strauss et al., 2006) were excluded from the study, similarly to subjects with history of head trauma, epilepsy or stroke, or with the diagnosis of acute psychiatric disorder, schizophrenia or mania, or alcohol dependence.

Processing steps included coordinate system transformation, rigid body transformations for correcting subject motion, non-rigid transformations for correcting susceptibility-related and EPI-induced distortions, with the local rotation of the b-matrix (the diffusion weighting directions) to avoid angular inaccuracies (Leemans and Jones, 2009). The high-resolution T1-weighted images were used as templates for registration to correct the distortions inherent to the EPI-acquisition method (Jezzard et al., 1998); thereby DW-images were spatially aligned to the T1W images.\nAfter tensor fitting, using the RESTORE (Robust Estimation of Tensors by Outlier Rejection) (Chang et al., 2005) algorithm, two voxelwise DTI-measures, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (Alexander et al., 2011;Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996) were calculated from the tensor eigenvalues, following their well-established definitions, to be used in voxel-level and ROIbased analyses.

See Supplement B for a detailed description of DARTEL normalization. The resulting normalized data was used unsmoothed for assessing the correlation between neuropsychology and microstructure, while for between group analyses Gaussian smoothing (FWHM  8 mm, isometric) using SPM was applied, see below.\nUse of the widely acknowledged tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006) method was also considered for its higher statistical power, but because of its inherent loss of spatial information (especially from the cortex) due to constraining analysis to the FA skeleton (i.e. the supposed center of white matter tracts), and its recently discovered poor spatial alignment performance in regions with complex WM structures (Bach et al., 2014), this option was omitted.\nThe whole brain voxel wise analysis, used in both between group and correlation analyses was extended to grey matter voxels, hypothesizing that small changes in GM microstructure which may precede macroscopic symptoms manifest in noticeable differences in DTI scalar values (Nusbaum, 2002;Pfefferbaum et al., 2010;Salminen et al., 2016).",

Statistical significance of the correlations was assessed using Students T-distribution.\nTwo types of corrections for multiple comparisons were employed: FWE control was achieved by the Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979), while the less conservative False Discovery Rate (FDR) control was achieved by the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up algorithm, which is considered to have more statistical power at the cost of controlling only the proportion of type I. errors (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Due to the large number of voxels in the calculations (280315 grey or white matter voxels, defined using the DARTEL template), achieving a FWE rate or FDR of 0.05 meant statistical p-values in the order of 10 -8 -10 -6 .\nIn order to distinguish between true and false positive results in the cases of small clusters spanning the volume of only a few voxels, we also checked the underlying trends using an exploratory threshold of p  0.001, uncorrected. True positive result would appear as the most significant voxels (the focal points) of a larger regions achieving significance with the exploratory threshold, while false positives could show as single voxels spread in random fashion.\nMoreover, similar, homogeneous behavior, or emerging patterns of correlation coefficients in specific anatomical regions (e.g. the same sign and scale of R-values in a specific gyrus) could also support the identification of true positives as the most significant voxels would be identified as the peaks of such regions.",

Decreased WM integrity (as indexed by MD and FA) was correlated with short-term memory performance and verbal fluency in the whole sample, further confirming the sufficiency of the study material in making inferences about MCI.\nBased on previous evidence (Kantarci, 2014;Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015), the most prominent between group differences and the strongest correlations with memory functions were expected in the cingulum and the fornix; this hypotheses was also confirmed in ROIbased calculations, and utilized in improving differentiation between study groups in logistic regression analysis.\nUse of the widely acknowledged tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006) method was considered for its higher statistical power, but (due to reasons explained in Section 2.3) this option was omitted.",

      "text": "A correlation between DTI measures and memory performance in subjects with MCI and the elderly has been confirmed in previous studies. For example, (Goldstein et al., 2009) identified a link between the ADC in the medial temporal lobe and verbal recall, using rectangular, hand drawn ROIs, while (Bosch et al., 2012) found a correlation between composite memory and the FA of large parts of the frontal and occipital WM in a TBSS analysis. Similarly, our calculations confirmed that more severe cognitive impairment (indexed by decreased performance in the neuropsychological tests) is linked to altered diffusion profile in several GM and WM regions.\nVoxel-wise analysis revealed negative correlation between the ACE total score (a comprehensive index of cognitive performance), and increased MD in the left parahippocampal region and in the pole of the left middle temporal gyrus, regions demonstrated to show early neuropathological changes in AD, as demonstrated by histological (Braak and Braak, 1990) and volumetry (Echávarri et al., 2011) studies. Verbal memory (indexed by the Rey test) also showed significant correlation with MD in the left parahippocampal region, while the PAL test, reflecting visual and working memory performance correlated with FA in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 45, a part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -VLPFC, which has a role in semantic tasks and the cognitive control of working memory (Badre and Wagner, 2007)).\nVisuospatial attention as indexed by the Trail Making test (part A) correlated with MD in the angular gyrus, which is associated with orienting attention to salient features in space (Arsalidou and Taylor, 2011;Seghier, 2013). Each of the small clusters with significant differences or correlations were identified as focal points of larger volumes with relatively high R-scores, achieving significance at exploratory thresholds (e.g. T  3 or R  0.4, p  0.001) (Figures 1 andS2), supporting the statement that our voxel-wise results are pinpointing the key anatomical structures associated with cognitive impairment.\nThe voxel-wise calculations identified the strongest correlation in voxels around the GM-WM boundary (subcortical WM) (in agreement with the aforementioned histological findings (Braak and Braak, 1990)), pointing towards the hypothesis that pathological changes in the fiber pathways of the temporal WM, assumed to precede the atrophy of the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex (Echávarri et al., 2011;Villain et al., 2008;Zhuang et al., 2013) might be the reason behind the early evincible cognitive impairment.\nThe more robust ROI-level approach strengthened these findings, by identifying similar correlation between decreased average FA values (decreased WM integrity) in the left cingulum and decreased verbal memory performance (as indexed by the Rey test), and decreased verbal fluency (as indexed by the ACE subscore). The left crus of the fornix  stria terminalis also showed decreased FA, correlated to visual memory performance as indexed by the PAL test. These results confirmed that the expected microstructural differences are present and significant in these ROIs therefore they might aid the automated differentiation between subject groups.",

      "text": "As described e.g. by Mori et al., the cingulum, the fornix and the stria terminalis are C-shaped WM bundles, connecting the hippocampus to other parts of the limbic system, such as the amygdala, mammillary bodies, septal area, and hypothalamus (Mori et al., 2005). The cingulum also connects the hippocampus to the occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex, while the fornix and the stria terminalis connects the amygdala to the cortex, and the former also projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (Poletti and Creswell, 1977).\nLike e.g. Bozoki et al. showed how the structure of the fornix is affected in MCI (Bozoki et al., 2012), a disruption in these WM tracts (increased MD and decreased FA) was detected in our study in patients with aMCI, compared to healthy controls or patients with naMCI, in the ROI based analysis. Meanwhile, voxel-wise analysis confirmed these findings by showing increased MD in the left and right temporal regions in aMCI patients relative to controls.\nThese results are also in line with previous investigations showing that early Alzheimer disease is underpinned by the damage of interconnected network, which predominantly involves degeneration of the tracts connecting the circuit of Papez (limbic system) (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010). However, it is yet unclear if these disruptions in WM connectivity are consequences or causes of disease progression.\nChanges in metabolism and atrophy of the precuneus are also shown to be associated in Alzheimers disease and MCI (Bailly et al., 2015). Similarly, our voxel-wise analysis also confirmed its involvement, as increased MD in left precuneal regions in aMCI patients. Additionally, MD was also increased in the left frontal cortex of aMCI patients, where axon density was shown to decrease in AD (Ikonomovic et al., 2007), but no significant differences were identified between the two MCI groups.\nIn summary, both methods showed impairments in the temporal regions of patients of the aMCI group, which is in line with results of numerous previous studies (Kantarci, 2014;Mielke et al., 2009;Nowrangi et al., 2013;Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015;Zhuang et al., 2010), while the voxel-wise approach also found differences in the left frontal and precuneal regions, differences also revealed by previous investigations (Bailly et al., 2015;Ikonomovic et al., 2007;Thillainadesan et al., 2012).",

The precuneus is an important hub of the default mode network, which is linked to several executive functions declined in dementia (Vasconcelos Lde et al., 2014). These results are supported by previous DTI, brain metabolism (FDG-PET) and fMRI studies (Coutinho et al., 2015;Machulda et al., 2009;ODwyer et al., 2011), however our ROI based analysis did not confirm this difference possibly because the ROI-based analysis was limited to WM tracts (based on the atlas by (Mori et al., 2008(Mori et al., , 2005))), while the voxel-wise analysis covered the GM as well.",

    "Differentiation between study groups by logistic regression": {
      "text": "Average FA and MD values, measured in the cingulum (hippocampus) and the stria terminalis  left crus of the fornix ROIs, were identified to be correlated with cognitive performance and to differ significantly between the study groups, thereby they were hypothesized to be potential candidates to improve the volumetry-based models differentiation performance in comparing study groups. A K-fold crossvalidation approach was used to test the discriminative models on small test samples, independent from the data they were constructed on. The features selected by the logistic regression in the separate models were mostly consistent; chance level discriminative performance was exceeded in all cases.\nLike previous investigations (Wang et al., 2009) claiming that combined DTI and volumetriccortical thickness measurements can improve categorizations between subjects with aMCI and controls, three sets of logistic regression models were compared. Without including DTI measures one or two volumetry-or thickness-based measures (the volume of the left hippocampus and the cortical thickness of the precuneus) stayed as relevant effects in the final models. Incorporating ROI-wise, average MD did not change the overall outcome; indeed all MD measures were excluded in the stepwise regression. On the same token FA measures were also excluded from all but one final models. Thereby the introduction of DTI measures in the discriminative models did not improve the approximately 80 categorization performance of volumetry and thickness based models for discrimination between aMCI patients and healthy controls.\nSimilarly, three sets of logistic regression models were compared to test discrimination performance between naMCI and controls. Only the cortical thickness of the precuneus stayed in all of the models without DTI measures, yielding a low discriminatory power. No further volumetric or DTI-based measures could significantly improve categorization, possibly because of the heterogeneous nature of the non-amnestic MCI subtype. A larger sample and the separation of the wide range of underlying pathologies to meaningful subgroups seem to be necessary for stronger inference.\nDespite the lack of improvement of categorization performance in patient versus control comparisons, introducing DTI measures had substantial benefit when discriminating between the two MCI subtypes. Especially the FA of the left crus of the fornix improved the models raising correct categorization performance by 22.22, in the same token the MD of the body of the corpus callosum resulted in 11.11 improvement compared to volumetry-derived models discriminating based on the volume of the left hippocampus. Moreover, these two white matter regions were stable in the k-fold cross validation, further supporting their importance for future discriminative models as well.\nNote, that our strategy of transforming the predefined ROIs to each subjects anatomical space, is less susceptible to registration artefacts compared to similar studies using coregistration to a common template space (e.g. MNI152), therefore it can be considered more precise, and if implemented properly, the improved categorization performance may even be achievable in general clinical applications.",

    "On the value of DTI measurements in MCI and AD": {
      "text": "Here, we presented a series of results that represent different levels of description from the voxel-level, through ROI-level to model-level. Even though the results may seem fragmented by the analysis methods there is a consistent pattern of WM involvement that is present through all levels of description. Voxel-level calculations demonstrated both strong correlations between the performance in neuropsychology tests and MD values and significant between-group differences in MD values in GM areas that are usually affected in Alzheimers disease, in general signaled by atrophy (Bailly et al., 2015;de la Monte, 1989;Echávarri et al., 2011;Villain et al., 2008); proving that the early involvement of these structures (most prominently the hippocampus) is present in our sample and is readily detectable through the altered diffusion profile.\nAbnormal tissue microstructure in the hippocampal areas is likely to be accompanied by measurable changes in the corresponding WM fiber pathways, as well (Kantarci, 2014;Ukmar et al., 2008). Although no meaningful clusters were identified in the white matter on the voxel level, presumably due to the weaker sensitivity resulting from the highly conservative thresholding (for proper voxel-level correction for multiple comparisons), the expected significant correlation with cognitive performance and between-group differences were demonstrated on the ROI-wise average values in the cingulum (hippocampal subdivision) and the stria terminalis  crus of the fornix ROIs in the left hemisphere.\nROI-wise average FA and MD values of these two well-defined, atlas-based WM regions were relatively simple to calculate in a straightforward manner. Moreover, as DTI is most sensitive in the WM, these ROIs also exhibited stable and substantial differences in betweengroup comparisons. Furthermore, the average FA of the stria terminalis  crus of the ROI also proved to be a relevant effect in the logistic regression analysis when creating models for discrimination between aMCI and naMCI study groups, with the MD of the body of the corpus callosum having similar relevance in improving discrimination performance. Although the FA of the left cingulum was also found significantly decreased in aMCI patients compared to controls, it was deemed to be irrelevant by logistic regression, as left hippocampal volumetry proved to contain sufficient information for sufficiently high level of correct categorization in itself.",

      "text": "While our results demonstrate the usefulness of DTI measures in improving categorization between study groups, especially between aMCI and naMCI the relatively low sample sizes of the study may limit the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, even the limited size of the study groups allowed the logistic regression analysis to be performed on separate training and testing datasets using a k-fold approach that clearly showed stably increased categorization performance with the inclusion of DTI-metrics, despite the expected high variability with such low sample sizes. Further studies with larger sample sizes would be beneficial to corroborate our results.\nThe cross-sectional nature of the study can also be considered a major limitation, but that can also be overcome with further (especially follow-up) examinations that would also allow for investigating the negative predictive value of including DTI measures in the discriminative models, providing additional means for confirming the results presented.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "Impairments of white matter integrity are early signs of pathological cognitive decline in both amnestic and non-amnestic clinical manifestations of MCI. DTI measurements in the fornix, the stria terminalis and the cingulum can add valuable information to grey matter volumetry and can help detect Alzheimer Disease in an early, preclinical stage. While future medications in AD are likely to be effective in such early stage, adding DTI protocols to volume measurements will help to identify the disease, when these medications will be able to prevent further decline. Furthermore, based on our results, it seems that DTI measurements can also help detecting non-Alzheimer type dementia in early stage, however, these findings must be confirmed by further studies with larger sample sizes.\nDifferentiation between the patient groups was demonstrated to be improved after expanding GM volumetry-based models with DTI measurements in two well established white matter regions.",

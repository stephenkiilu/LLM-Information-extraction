    "abstract": "We investigated the association between amyloid-β deposition and white matter (WM) integrity as a determinant of brain glucose hypometabolism across the Alzheimers disease (AD) spectrum. We assessed ninety-six subjects (27 cognitively normal, 49 mild cognitive impairment, and 20 AD dementia) who underwent  18 FFDG and  18 FFlorbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging. Among the regions with reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the AD group, we selected a voxel of interest in the angular bundle bilaterally for subsequent analyses. Using voxel-based interaction models at voxel level, we tested whether the regional hypometabolism is associated with FA in the angular bundle and regional amyloid-β deposition. In the AD patients,  18 FFDG hypometabolism in the striatum, mesiobasal temporal, orbitofrontal, precuneus, and cingulate cortices were associated with the interaction between high levels of  18 FFlorbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) in these regions and low FA in the angular bundle. We found that the interaction between, rather than the independent effects of, high levels of amyloid-β deposition and WM integrity disruption determined limbic hypometabolism in patients with AD. This finding highlights a more integrative model for AD, where the interaction between partially independent processes determines the glucose hypometabolism.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide 1. AD pathophysiology has been conceptualized as a cascade of sequential events triggered by amyloid-β deposition, followed by downstream events such as tau hyperphosphorylation, glucose hypometabolism, and eventually dementia 234. However, the lack of a strong association between amyloid-β deposition and cognitive and synaptic dysfunctions has questioned whether amyloid-β deposition is a sufficient condition to trigger AD progression 5. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the synergistic interaction between, rather than the sequential effects of, pathological pathways such as amyloid-β and tau is the key element associated with the pathophysiological progression of AD 6.\nSince the original description, AD has been characterized as a gray matter disease 7, and the most prominent pathophysiological theories of AD postulate that cortical Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https:doi.org10.1007s12035-018-1405-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\namyloidosis and tau accumulation underlie most neurobiological processes 8,9. However, the disconnection of fiber bundles has also been reported from the early stages of the disease 10,11, suggesting that white matter (WM) abnormalities are also important in AD pathophysiology 12131415.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that assesses WM organization and microstructure through fractional anisotropy (FA) 16. In AD, WM tracts in the limbic system have shown reduced FA, suggesting loss of axons and myelin, and hence impairment in connectivity 17181920. The pathological processes underlying such changes are still undetermined, although both Wallerian degeneration secondary to cortical neuronal loss and retrogenesis with primary axonal damage and myelin breakdown may contribute 21,22.\n18 FFluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 FFDG) and  18 FFlorbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) measure cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid-β deposition, respectively 23,24. Studies in non-human primates have shed light on the relationship between WM disconnectivity and cerebral glucose metabolism in AD, showing that neurotoxic lesions in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices lead to neocortical and hippocampal hypometabolism 25. Subsequent human studies have correlated abnormalities in topographically related tracts to hypometabolic regions (for example, fornix FA abnormalities, and posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism), suggesting that the progression of cerebral hypometabolism temporally follows amyloid-β deposition 26.\nSuch background information leaves it open whether and how these two, at least, partially independent pathophysiological processes-WM abnormalities and β-amyloid deposition-interact to determine AD progression. Here, in a cross-sectional study, we tested the hypothesis that  18 FFDG uptake reduction in limbic regions depends upon t h e i n t e r a c t i o n b e t w e e n a m y l o i d -β d e p o s i t i o n ( 18 FFlorbetapir PET SUVR) and WM integrity (FA), rather than their separated effects.",

      "text": "For the present study, we only included ADNI participants who had  18 FFlorbetapir,  18 FFDG, and DTI acquisitions at same visit. Cognitively normal (CN) individuals had a minimental state examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. MCIs had a MMSE score equal to or greater than 24, a CDR of 0.5, subjective and objective memory deficits, and essentially normal activities of daily living. AD patients had a MMSE score lower or equal 26, CDR higher than 0.5, and met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD 27. All individuals had absence of any other neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, the ADNI study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of each participating site and was conducted in accordance with Federal Regulations, the Internal Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and good clinical practices (GCP). The ADNI Research Committee has approved all the protocols used in the study. The study subjects provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment for imaging and completed questionnaires that were approved by each participating sites IRB.

Scans comprised of 41 diffusion encoding and five resting (b0) directions. A voxel size of 1.4 mm  1.4 mm  2.7 mm and b  1000 smm 2 was used. All scans used in this study were corrected for EPI current. T1 scans were acquired on the same GE 3 T scanner with a 1.2 mm  1 mm  1 mm voxel size. Further acquisition details are available from ADNI website (ADNI-INFO. org). After processing the DTIs, FA maps were generated using FSL-DTIFIT from the skull-stripped eddy current corrected images in the native MRI space (Fig. 1). A statistical comparison of voxel-wise FA values was performed to identify the differences between each diagnostic group (Fig. 2). The anatomical WM bundles have been identified by the MRI Atlas of human white matter. For the subsequent analysis, the angular bundle was defined a prior, since it is a well-defined tract related to AD dementia, which directly connects the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex. A voxelof-interest (VOI) was obtained from the angular bundle bilaterally and was used to extract FA values from each subject (see supplementary information).",

Subsequently, in the post-processing stage, the images underwent non-linear spatial normalization to the MNI 152 template space using the transformation derived from the automatic PETT1-MRI transformation and anatomical MRI registration for each subject. Voxel-wise standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated for  18 FFlorbetapir and  18 FFDG using the cerebellum gray matterglobal white matter and pons as the reference regions, respectively.

The CN group has  18 2.\nPatients with AD had significantly reduced FAs in the angular bundle bilaterally and in the fornix compared to CN (P  0.05) (Fig. 2), but not in relation to the MCI group. Since WM abnormalities on the angular bundle were related to a diagnosis of AD dementia, a VOI was defined in this region for the subsequent analysis. Importantly, the three diagnostic groups showed distinct averaged FA values in In the AD group, a voxel-based analysis revealed that  18 FFDG hypometabolism in the striatum, basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, precuneus, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortices were driven by the interaction between high levels of  18 FFlorbetapir uptake in these regions and low FA in the angular bundle (Fig. 3). Moreover, the laterality of the angular bundle VOI was associated with distinct patterns of regional hypometabolism. The interaction of RAB disconnections with amyloid-β deposition was associated with  18 FFDG hypometabolism in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 3a), while disconnections in the LAB were associated with the striatum, basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices  18 FFDG hypometabolism (Fig. 3b).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We showed that the interaction between amyloid-β accumulation and reduction in the angular bundle is significantly associated with hypometabolism in limbic regions in patients with AD dementia.\nOverall, this finding is in agreement with an integrative framework proposing that the co-occurrence of different pathophysiological processes potentiates neurodegeneration and clinical progression in AD 6,313233. As previously shown, we found decreased FA values in WM tracts associated with the memory system, including the angular bundle and the fornix 343536. Microstructural WM damage disrupts connections to cortical areas, as observed in regional changes in the parahippocampal WM, leading to mesial temporal lobe deafferentation 37. Most abnormalities are found in temporal lobe regions, with frequent targets in the retrogenesis model of WM impairment in AD. Previous reports have shown associations between reduced FA and both regional glucose hypometabolism, particularly of the posterior cingulate cortex, and the volume of the descending cingulum 38,39. The hippocampal atrophy, also a neurodegenerative radiological feature of AD, has been also related with decreased FA 40. The posterior cingulate cortex metabolism was also inversely related to diffusivity increase in the hippocampus 41. Assessing the temporal relationship between biomarkers, Villain and colleagues posit that hippocampal atrophy leads to the disruption of the cingulum bundle and cingulate fasciculus, with subsequent glucose hypometabolism in these areas 42,43.\nWhereas biomarkers of neurodegeneration and WM disruption have been previously correlated, similar findings have not been observed in regard to amyloid-β deposition PET imaging in pre-dementia subjects 40. In our interaction study, we found hypometabolic areas related to angular bundle abnormalities and also to amyloid-β deposition in the AD group. Interestingly, these regions are described in Braaks neuropathological stages B and C involving isocortex association areas, in patients with significant clinical decline 9. These findings suggest a possible increase metabolic vulnerability to the interaction of the posterior limbic structures in the right non-dominant hemisphere, and in the anterior and basal nuclei areas in the dominant left hemisphere.\nThe relationship between CSF biomarkers (Aβ 1-42 and p-Tau181) and WM integrity has been studied in CN adults, and a positive correlation was found between the Aβ 1-42 p-Tau181 ratio and FA in the fornix, corpus callosum, and inferior, superior, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus 44. Furthermore, significantly, reduced FA in the left posterior cingulum was observed in patients with pathological CSF total tau levels 45, and the concentration of Aβ 1-42 has been directly correlated with mean FA values 46. In fact, decreased FA has been reported in frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies 47,48. Interestingly, amyloid PET positive asymptomatic subjects have been shown to display increased FA, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in very early stages of the disease by glial response and axonal pruning at regions of crossing fibers 49. We speculate that the latter mechanism may explain the non-significant results observed in our CN and patients. Further studies with a larger number of asymptomatic and MCI subjects, with enriched tau status subjects, may help to elucidate these questions and capture group differences. Importantly, previous studies did not observe strong associations between regional amyloid-β deposition and glucose hypometabolism in AD patients 50. Here, we have shown that the interaction with white matter integrity disruption is the key element linking regional glucose hypometabolism and amyloid pathology in the dementia phase of AD.\nIntegrating distinct modalities may foster a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AD progression, beyond the role of individual biomarkers. It has been shown that amyloid status combined with CSF tau levels, and also with baseline cerebral metabolic decline, predicts conversion to dementia in patients with MCI 515253. Therefore, integrative biomarker studies may offer a new avenue to evaluate individual risks of progression along the cognitive continuum of aging. Specifically, since the interaction with WM disruption is the key element linking amyloid-β and pathophysiological progression in AD, we may argue that our results suggest that the use of biomarkers of WM integrity could help to identify those fated to develop dementia symptoms among MCIs with amyloid-β pathology.\nThe major methodological strength of our study is the use of only continuous biomarker values. Biomarkers occur on a continuum; therefore, dichotomization techniques are invariably subject to analytical and methodological idiosyncrasies. Some methodological issues limit the interpretation of our results. The cross-sectional analysis prevents inferences on the progression of WM abnormalities, amyloid deposition, and glucose metabolism. It is also important to highlight that FDG SUVR measurement is sensitive to several biological factors such as blood glucose levels, physical, and synaptic activity.\nAlso, because patients had to have performed the complete imaging protocol, we included a relatively small number of AD subjects, and thus our main findings need confirmation in larger samples. Despite the limited number of subjects, in order to avoid potential confounding effects, we performed all the statistical analyses including covariates that could impact the results, as age, gender, vascular WM load, education, and APOE ε4 status. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results show that combining glucose metabolism, amyloid-β, and WM integrity in relevant brain regions offers the encouraging possibility to assess different pathological processes in the same patient at the same time. More importantly, the integration of different biomarkers in sophisticated statistical models may help clarify the pathological alterations observed along the AD spectrum.",

      "text": "In sum, the major result of our study demonstrates a strong association amyloid-β deposition and glucose hypometabolism through synergistic interaction with white matter disruption. These results support a more integrative model for AD progression, that the convergence of partially independent pathological pathways drives disease progression. These findings provide novel insights in AD pathophysiology framework by suggesting that future disease-modifying therapies using  18 FFDG as a biomarker for efficacy should integrate measures of white matter integrity in order to better interpret the therapeutic effects of the intervention.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, associated with multifaceted dysfunction involving brain metabolism, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and white matter. With the increase of AD research, comprehensive and non-invasive assessment of pathological changes in the brain of AD patients is an urgent requirement. In this regard, rapid development of imageological techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), currently offers a realistic possibility. In AD research, different types of MRI sequences have been used for detection of AD pathological changes (Spencer et al., 2013;Sun et al., 2005;Verclytte et al., 2016;Westman et al., 2010), establishing a foundation for systematic assessment of AD in the future. Commonly, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to estimate white matter connectivity through multiple diffusion tensor measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (Alexander et al., 2007). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an analytical technique that uses 1 H signals to determine the relative shift of targeted metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Gujar et al., 2005). Further, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a tissue perfusion imaging technique that employs magnetically labeled arterial blood 1 H protons as an intrinsic tracer (Petcharunpaisan et al., 2010). Thus far, few studies have reported on the possibility of combinational assessment of different MRI methods (and in particular, MRS, ASL, and DTI together) in evaluation of AD mice. Currently, the amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPS1) transgenic mouse model has been widely used to explore underlying AD pathophysiology and test novel therapies (Li et al., 2016b). This AD animal model replicates formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in the mouse brain, with obvious learning and memory dysfunction at 8 months-old (Li et al., 2016d). Consequently, this model can be regarded as a valuable tool for validation and clarification of potential neuroimaging techniques.\nHere, we examined the brain of 8-month-old APPPS1 mice and agematched wild-type (WT) littermates by applying MRS, DTI, and ASL. Afterwards, we correlated MRI results with histological staining and ultrastructural observations to determine whether in vivo imaging reflects pathological changes in APPPS1 mice, including metabolism, CBF, and white matter structure. Accordingly, this study may be valuable for choosing appropriate tools for non-invasive evaluation of AD pathologies or novel therapies in the APPPS1 mouse model.",

    "Decreased regional CBF in APPPS1 mice detected by ASL": {
      "text": "For each animal investigated, a slice of 2 mm thickness was examined, in which the hippocampus was identified (Fig. 1A). From both the hippocampus and brain, ROIs were transferred from the corresponding anatomical images to CBF maps. Average CBF values (in mL min -1 100 g tissue -1 ) were collected from these ROIs. As shown in Fig. 1B, 8-month-old APPPS1 transgenic mice demonstrated relatively decreased regional CBF in most brain areas (right hippocampus, right cortex, right thalamus, left hemisphere, left amygdala, left hippocampus, left cortex, and left thalamus) compared with age-matched WT mice. Further, statistically significant hypoperfusion was observed in the left hippocampus, left thalamus, and right cortex (P  0.05, FDR corrected), suggesting that these regions might be the earliest affected brain areas in AD. Hypoperfusion in AD mouse brain was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. In the hippocampus of AD mice, average MVD determined by CD31 staining was significantly lower compared with WT mice (26.06  4.87 vs 44.27  5.67, P  0.03). A similar result was observed in the cortex (13.03  2.90 vs 28.87  3.51, P  0.005) (Fig. 1C). Overall, these results suggest that ASL is a useful tool for evaluating reduced CBF in AD mice.",

    "Slight differences between APPPS1 and WT mice detected by DTI": {
      "text": "Next, we analyzed quantitative measurements (including FA, MD, DA and DR) in ROIs from both white and gray matter structures. As shown in Fig. 2A andB, APPPS1 mice showed no significant differences compared with WT mice. In comparison, mean FA values were slightly higher in the olfactory bulb, left hippocampus, and left internal capsule of APPPS1 mice. Other brain regions (including the amygdala, right hippocampus, cortex, right internal capsule, cingulate gyrus, and corpus callosum) showed relatively lower FA values in APPPS1 mice. For MD parametric statistics, almost all ROIs (including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, corpus callosum, hippocampus, cortex, internal capsule, and cingulate gyrus) exhibited relatively lower MD values in APP PS1 mice. However, none of them showed a significant difference in MD value between APPPS1 and WT mice (P  0.05, FDR corrected). Similarly, all ROIs (including the amygdala, corpus callosum, hippocampus and cortex) exhibited relatively lower DA values in APPPS1 mice (P  0.05, FDR corrected). However, the DR values in corpus callosum and cortex of APPPS1 mice were slightly increased compared to the controls (P  0.05, FDR corrected). Nevertheless, MBP staining showed a more abundant number of MBP-positive fibers in the cortex and corpus callosum of the APPPS1 group compared with the control group. Moreover, mean density (IODarea) was significantly lower in APPPS1 mice than WT mice (P  0.05) (Fig. 2C).",

    "Distinct neurochemical changes in the hippocampus and cortex of APP PS1 transgenic mice": {
      "text": "To examine brain metabolic differences between APPPS1 and WT mice, 1 H-MRS was obtained from a corresponding coronal T2-weighted image of both the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 3A, red box). Compared with WT mice, decreased NAA and Glu peaks and increased mI peak were found in the cortex and hippocampus of APPPS1 mice. Quantification analysis showed significantly reduced NAACr (1.53  0.03 vs 1.69  0.03, P  0.032, FDR corrected) and GluCr (0.49  0.03 vs 0.61  0.03, P  0.04, FDR corrected) ratios in the hippocampus of APPPS1 mice, while mICr (0.61  0.04 vs 0.42  0.02, P  0.016, FDR corrected) ratio was significantly higher compared with WT mice (Fig. 3A). In the cortex, only decreased NAA Cr (1.55  0.08 vs 1.84  0.03, P  0.036, FDR corrected) ratio and elevated mICr (0.89  0.09 vs 0.56  0.05, P  0.036, FDR corrected) ratio were significantly different between APPPS1 and WT mice (Fig. 3A). No significant difference was observed in ChoCr ratio, regardless of brain region (P  0.05, FDR corrected). Furthermore, Nissl staining was performed to assess neuronal activity in the brain of APPPS1 mice (Fig. 3B). Compared with WT mice, APPPS1 mice showed neuronal loss and disappearance of Nissl bodies in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3B). Quantification analysis showed significantly reduced neuronal number in APPPS1 mice compared with WT mice (P  0.01) (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results suggest that NAACr and mICr ratios may be potential biomarkers for discriminating between APPPS1 and WT mice.",

      "text": "Ultrastructural analysis showed the presence of Aβ plaques and degenerated changes in the neocortex and hippocampus of APPPS1 mice. Dense and mature forms of senile plaques (which are typical of neuritic plaques) were observed in the neocortex of APPPS1 mice (Fig. 4A). These plaques were surrounded by abundant phagolysosomes (Fig. 4A). Moreover, high resolution TEM images showed that Aβ plaques were filled with tight Aβ fibers (Fig. 4D). We also observed formation of huge lysosomes containing multivesicular bodies, indicating dysfunction of neuronal lysosomes in APPPS1 mouse brain (Fig. 4B). Additionally, focal demyelination, dilated perivascular space, and neural apoptosis were found in the hippocampus of APPPS1 mice (Fig. 4C, E, andF).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In vivo 7T MRI, high-field MRI with high resolution, is regarded as a novel tool for evaluation of pathological changes in AD. Previous MRI studies in AD mice have mainly focused on brain volume changes (Hayes et al., 2014;Yin et al., 2014) and Aβ burden (Kim et al., 2014;Li et al., 2016a). In this study, we assessed pathological changes of APP PS1 transgenic mice and WT mice by applying a series of MRI sequences (specifically ASL, DTI, and MRS) to identify comprehensive AD biomarkers. After examination, the MRI results were verified by histological examination and ultrastructural analysis. Although Wells et al. performed a similar multi-parametric imaging study (including DTI and ASL) in a tau-pathology AD mouse model (Wells et al., 2015), its evidence of blood perfusion and microstructure from pathological studies was deficient. Our data show that CBF and brain metabolism were markedly changed in AD mice while white matter structure was barely significant compared with WT mice. Nevertheless, the pathological results of CBF, brain metabolism and white matter structure in light microscopy and electron microscopy were significantly different between AD and WT groups.\nCurrently, ASL is gaining growing popularity in clinical evaluation of AD patients (Zhang, 2016), but studies on its use in AD mice are still limited. Recently, several studies using MRI showed cortical hypoperfusion in an AD transgenic mouse model (Decker et al., 2018;Hebert et al., 2013;Massaad et al., 2010), but few studies have examined other brain regions apart from the cortex, with the connection between histology and MRI rarely investigated. Here, we investigated bilateral brain areas of the hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and thalamus. Consequently, we found significantly decreased CBF in the left hippocampus, left thalamus, and right cortex of AD mice. This is in agreement with the findings of a previous study (Kobayashi et al., 2008), which found markedly lower CBF in the left hippocampal and right temporal regions in patients with mild AD. Furthermore, decreased blood flow was validated by our CD31 staining results showing decreased vascular number. Therefore, ASL offers the potential to visualize brain vascular dysfunction. Further, the hippocampus and cortex might be influenced in the early AD stage. As the disease progresses, diffuse decreased blood flow would occur throughout the brain.\nIn recent years, MRS has been widely used to detect neurochemical alterations in specific brain regions of AD mice. However, most MRS studies in AD mice have focused on the hippocampus (Chen et al., 2012;Kuhla et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2017). In the present study, we obtained MRS data from the cortex and hippocampus of control and APPPS1 transgenic mice. In the hippocampus, NAACr and GluCr ratios were significantly decreased in AD mice, while mICr ratio, a marker for the glial cell proliferation, was significantly increased compared with WT mice, consistent with a report by Chen et al., (Chen et al., 2012). However, in the cortex, only reduced NAACr ratio and increased mI Cr ratio showed significant differences in AD mouse brain. This may be because metabolic dysfunction of neuron and glia in the hippocampus initially contributes to AD progression before cortical involvement. Furthermore, decreased NAACr ratio and increased mICr ratio might be more sensitive than other biomarkers for detection or evaluation of AD, at least in 8-month-old APPPS1 mice. Due to the clear directionality of water diffusion, DTI has been widely used to assess white matter structure of the brain. However, DTI findings in AD mice are inconsistent. For example, one study reported that APPPS1 mice had higher FA values in the hippocampus (Shu et al., 2013), while another study in 3Tg mice showed the opposite result (Snow et al., 2017). In our study, FA value was not significantly different between APPPS1 and control groups. Still, FA value in AD mice was slightly higher in the left hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and left internal capsule. This might be due to the left hippocampus being the early region infiltrated in AD mice, consistent with lower CBF in the left hippocampus, as detected by ASL sequence. In contrast to previous studies (Qin et al., 2013;Shu et al., 2013), MD value in our study showed no significant difference. However, average MD value was slightly decreased in most brain regions in the APPPS1 group, which is consistent with another study (Sun et al., 2005). Furthermore, DR and DA value were also compared in our study. We found a slight increase of DR in the corpus callosum and cortex of APPPS1 mice, which may reflect demyelination in these brain regions. Overall, in our study, DTI imaging results are not significantly different. This might be due to pathological changes of white matter fibers in 8-month-old APPPS1 mice, which are not significant to be detected by DTI sequence, as agedependent Aβ accumulation is linked with white matter abnormalities (Song et al., 2004). For example, studies have shown significant differences by DTI imaging with AD transgenic mice older than 12 months old (Qin et al., 2013;Shu et al., 2013;Sun et al., 2005;Zerbi et al., 2013).\nAlthough we evaluated multifaceted brain changes from both MRI imaging and pathological examination, there was one main limitation to our study: we only tested APPPS1 mice at 8 months old and did not assess longitudinal changes. Moreover, this AD mouse model doesnt include all pathological changes in AD patients, translation of the MRI findings in this study to AD patients should be treated with caution. Thus, the observed results imply this combinational MRI sequences is merely appropriate for evaluation of 8-month-old APPPS1 mice or elder ones.\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to apply ASL, DTI, and MRS simultaneously for evaluation of AD transgenic mice to detect pathological changes in vivo. Although differences in DTI results between AD mice and WT mice were not as significant as MRS and ASL findings, our findings suggest that ASL, MRS, and DTI are associated in some way with CBF, brain metabolism, and white matter abnormalities. Moreover, compared with age-matched WT mice, we found the hippocampus (particularly the left hippocampus) to be more damaged than other brain regions, providing new insight into understanding of AD pathophysiology. Finally, further studies require AD patients and more animals to fully validate the meaning of our findings.",

Before MRI examination, mice were anesthetized with 5 isoflurane95 O 2 mixture for induction in the interior of a plexiglass chamber, and then administered 2 isoflurane98 O 2 mixture for maintenance while in the center of the magnetic field. Animal temperature was carefully maintained at normal and respiratory rate closely monitored using an animal physiological guarding system. T2-weighted images were obtained using a rapid acquisition method with relaxation enhancement (RARE) and the following parameters: repetition time (TR)  3,500 ms, echo time (TE)  33 ms, RARE factor  4, field of view (FOV)  21  21 mm, acquisition matrix  256  256, and slice thickness  0.6 mm.

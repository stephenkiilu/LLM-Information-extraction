    "abstract": "Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) even in the mild form may result in long-lasting post-concussion symptoms. TBI is also a known risk to late-life neurodegeneration. Recent studies suggest that dysfunction in the glymphatic system, responsible for clearing protein waste from the brain, may play a pivotal role in the development of dementia following TBI. Given the diverse nature of TBI, longitudinal investigations are essential to comprehending the dynamic changes in the glymphatic system and its implications for recovery. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated two promising glymphatic imaging markers, namely the enlarged perivascular space (ePVS) burden and Diffusion Tensor Imaging-based ALPS index, in 44 patients with mTBI at two early post-injury time points: approximately 14 days (14Day) and 6-12 months (6-12Mon) post-injury, while also examining their associations with postconcussion symptoms. Additionally, 37 controls, comprising both orthopedic patients and healthy individuals, were included for comparative analysis. Results: Our key findings include: (1) White matter ePVS burden (WM-ePVS) and ALPS index exhibit significant correlations with age. (2) Elevated WM-ePVS burden in acute mTBI (14Day) is significantly linked to a higher number of post-concussion symptoms, particularly memory problems. (3) The increase in the ALPS index from acute (14Day) to the chronic (6-12Mon) phases in mTBI patients correlates with improvement in sleep measures. Furthermore, incorporating WM-ePVS burden and the ALPS index from acute phase enhances the prediction of chronic memory problems beyond socio-demographic and basic clinical information. Conclusion: ePVS burden and ALPS index offers distinct values in assessing glymphatic structure and activity. Early evaluation of glymphatic function could",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant global health concern, affecting approximately 55 million people worldwide (1). About 70 of all TBI is categorized as mild, with admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13-15 (2). However, even mild brain injuries may result in structural and functional changes in the brain, leading to long term post-concussion symptoms (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). Among the most common postconcussion symptoms are cognitive issues, such as memory loss, reduced information processing speed, problems with divided attention, and decline in executive functions (8)(9)(10). TBI is also known as a risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases later in life, such as Alzheimers Disease (11)(12)(13)(14).\nWhile it is still unclear how TBI contributes to progressive neurodegeneration, increasing evidence points toward glymphatic dysfunction and impaired protein waste clearance as potential key factors in developing dementia (15,16). The glymphatic system, a structured fluid transport network, spans the periarterial and perivenous spaces (located in the perivascular space), as well as the brains interstitial spaces (17)(18)(19). This system facilitates the exchange of solutes between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the interstitial fluid, allowing waste products from the brain to be transported away. The glymphatic system is also shown to be most active during sleep, when the brains extracellular space expands, allowing CSF infiltration along the perivascular space (20,21). Notably, experimental TBI has been shown to cause a 60 reduction in glymphatic flow, which persists for over a month (22). Additional evidence from animal studies also supports the idea that glymphatic dysfunction contributes to subsequent neurodegeneration and cognitive decline (17,23). Several studies have targeted novel treatments that consider the glymphatic system as an intervention target for TBI and neurodegeneration. For example, Lee et al. demonstrated that focused ultrasound can improve glymphatic-lymphatic drainage of amyloid beta in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease (24). Additionally, osteopathic manipulative treatment has been shown to optimize glial lymphatic clearance of CSF and improve interstitial waste product removal in severe TBI patients (25), as well as alleviate concussion symptoms (26).\nImaging the glymphatic system directly in humans poses significant challenges due to the necessity of intrathecally injecting gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents as CSF tracers to track their passage through the glymphatic system (27,28). However, this method is invasive and not suitable for widespread application in the general population. Several non-invasive glymphatic imaging techniques have been developed (29,30) as alternative approaches for assessing the glymphatic system. Among them, two most promising and broadly used methods are the structural MRI-based Enlarged PeriVascular Spaces (ePVS) method (31,32), and the Diffusion Tensor Imaging ALong the Perivascular Spaces (DTI-ALPS) method (33,34). Elevated ePVS burden, identified from T2-weighted MRI images or in junction with T1-weighted MRI images, could indicate blockage in interstitial fluid drainage (35) and impaired glymphatic function (31,36). A high ePVS burden is linked to normal aging (37,38), TBI (39)(40)(41), Alzheimers disease and related dementia (42,43), and sleep quality (44,45). Recent research has shown correlations between increased ePVS burden and poor sleep, as well as persistent postconcussion symptoms in TBI patients (39,40,46). The DTI ALPS index, derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), quantifies glymphatic diffusion activity by assessing diffusivity along the deep medullary veins at the level of the lateral ventricular bodies (33). A higher ALPS index, indicative of increased glymphatic system activity, has been shown to correlate with better cognitive function and brain reserve in the aging population (47). Conversely, a lower ALPS index is linked to poor sleep (48,49) and an elevated risk of developing Alzheimers disease and related dementia (33,34,47,50,51). In TBI patients, cross-sectional studies have yielded mixed results, with some reporting a reduced ALPS index post-injury (52)(53)(54) while others showing an increased index (55). This discrepancy may reflect the dynamic changes in white matter structure and glymphatic activity during TBI recovery.\nDue to the heterogeneous nature of TBI and its association with various pre-existing risk factors impacting patient outcomes (2, 56,57), longitudinal studies are critical for understanding the dynamic alterations in the glymphatic system and gaining insights into its role in TBI recovery. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal changes in glymphatic imaging markers, specifically ePVS burden and the DTI-ALPS index, in patients with mild TBI (mTBI) during the early post-injury phase and up to one year post-injury. We hypothesize that glymphatic imaging markers will correlate with patient symptom ratings, and that longitudinal changes in these markers will reflect underlying glymphatic alterations associated with TBI recovery. By elucidating these relationships, we hope to provide insights into the potential of glymphatic imaging markers as predictors of long-term outcomes in TBI patients.",

      "text": "Participants in this study were prospectively recruited, which included mTBI patients, orthopedic control patients with no head injury, and healthy controls without mTBI or orthopedic injury. Age range for all participants was 18-60 year and included 58 male and 42 female. All participants were English speaking and had no contraindications for MRI. mTBI and orthopedic control patients were recruited from the R Adam Cowley Shock Trauma Center (STC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Inclusion criteria for the mTBI patients included (I1) an admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13-15; (I2) a positive admission CT, or if negative CT, then with documentedreported loss of consciousness or amnesia andor evidence of facial trauma; (I3) admission to the STC within 24 h of injury. Exclusion criteria included (E1) penetrating head injury; (E2) status post trauma due to asphyxiation; (E3) history of prior head injury requiring medical attention within the last 5 years, or prior injury at any time which resulted in persistent neurological or psychological deficits; (E4) history of neurological andor psychiatric illness such as brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, seizures, etc.; (E5) history of stroke or myocardial infarction; (E6) active duty military status; (E7) police custody or prisoner status; and (E8) pregnant women. For the orthopedic control group, the inclusion criteria were being admitted to the STC for injuries other than brain injury and negative head CT if available, along with criteria (I3) as previously stated for mTBI patients. The same exclusion criteria applied. Healthy controls were recruited through online advertisements and flyers posted on the University of Maryland Baltimore campus, or they may be family or friends of the recruited patients. The inclusion criteria included no brain abnormalities, along with all the same exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland Baltimore. All participants underwent informed consent and were compensated for their participation in the study.\nA total of 63 mTBI patients, 31 orthopedic control patients (OC) and 20 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in the study. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the progression of study participants from enrollment to data analysis. 56 mTBI patients, 25 OCs and 20 HCs completed all MRI and assessments. For patients, their initial MRI visit was at approximately 14 days post their injury (14Day visit). 46 mTBI patients came back for follow-up visits at 6 months to 12 months (6-12Mon visit). Data from two additional patients were excluded after manual inspection of data quality due to motion artifacts. For controls, only one study visit was considered. 2 OCs were excluded due to later discovery of prior history of TBI, 1 HC and 1 OC were excluded due to clinically relevant incidental findings from MRI scans, 3 OCs were excluded due to motion artifacts. Eventually, a total of 44 mTBI and 37 controls (19 OCs and 18 HCs) were included in our data analysis.\nFor all mTBI patients, their admission CT findings were obtained from electronic medical database. MRI imaging findings were based on radiology reads from the 14Day conventional MRI sequences (T1-weighted T2-weighted, FLAIR, SWI, and diffusion weighted images). Any findings from either the admission CT or 14Day MRI were considered as positive for CT or MRI findings.  No microbleeds were reported in regions assessed for DTI-ALPS index.",

Patients reporting at least a mild symptom (RPQ rating  2) were considered symptomatic, similar as in the TRACK-TBI study (10). Total RPQ scores were calculated, along with total number of symptoms (rated at least mild).

      "text": "We employed a previously described method for automatic segmentation of the ePVS burden using 3D T1w and T2w images (32,46). Briefly speaking, the 3D T1w and T2w images were first processed with the Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipeline ( 62) for rigidly aligning both sets of images to the MNI space, up-sampled to 0.7 mm resolution, followed with sub-cortical segmentation using the FreeSurfer software (version v6.0.1). Following intensity normalization based on white matter signal, enhanced perivascular space contrast (EPC) image was generated, followed with frangi filter to create a vesselness map. To create the final binary ePVS mask, a threshold h of 0.0000002 combined with a minimum cluster size of 9 (3mm 3 ) was used for white matter ePVS. A slightly lower h was used here than previously noted (32,46) as we found this combined with a minimum cluster size in our data provided the best balance between sensitivity in detecting ePVS and limiting false detection rate (46). For the basal ganglia (BG) region, h was set at 0.0000003 with the same minimum cluster size.\nePVS volume was calculated from both the whole brain WM and BG regions based on the FreeSurfer segmented masks. To account for brain size differences, the ePVS burden (46) was calculated as ePVS burden  100  ePVS volumeregion volume. The corresponding region was either the whole brain white matter (WM-ePVS burden) or basal ganglia (BG-ePVS burden). Figure 2 shows an example of the EPC images along with segmented ePVS masks on a healthy control and an mTBI patient of similar ages, for both the white matter regions and basal ganglia regions, along with calculated WM-ePVS burden and BG-ePVS burden. Notably due to the lower contrast between ePVS and gray matter in the basal ganglia regions, the BG-ePVS segmentation appeared to be less reliable than WM-ePVS, with some ePVS missing.",

For regions-ofinterest (ROI) analysis, to improve reproducibility in ALPS calculation (69), we took the approach to first warp all the diffusion maps to the MNI152 standard space provided in FSL (FMRIB Software Library, version 6.0, Oxford, UK) (70). The B0 image was first registered to the HCP-processed T1w images using the EPI to structural registration tool, epi_reg (part of FSL). T1w images were warped to the MNI152 space using the SyN tool (71) in ANTs. All registration steps were concatenated first before warping the diffusion maps to the MNI152 space. Additionally, the principal diffusion direction map was warped using the vecreg tool (part of FDT-FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox) to create colored FA map in the MNI152 space. Figure 3 shows the representative FA colormap and diffusivity maps on a representative participant in the MNI152 space, where a single set of four 16mm 2 square ROIs were manually drawn in the projection fiber and association fiber adjacent to the medullary veins at the level of the lateral ventricle body. Placement of the ROIs were checked on all subjects and manually adjusted (if needed) to ensure proper coverage within the projection and association fiber regions. Mean values from the two bi-lateral ROIs were extracted for ALPS index calculation.",

Participant assessment scores included total RPQ score for symptoms (range: 0-88), individual symptom score (0-4), total number of symptoms (0-22), and PSQI scores for sleep quality (0-21).\nWe first tested for differences of imaging markers and symptom scores between the two control cohorts (OCs and HCs) using two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. When no significant differences were found, we combined the two control cohorts into a single control group. We sub-grouped mTBI patients into those with and without memory problems based on their 14Day memory symptoms (RPQ rating  2). Group comparisons (controls vs. mTBI, mTBI-Memory Prob vs. mTBI-No Memory Prob) were conducted two-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests.\nAssociations between imaging markers and age were analyzed using Pearson correlations. Associations of imaging measures with assessment scores were analyzed using multiple variable linear regression with age and sex as covariables. Longitudinal analysis in mTBI patients was conducted using linear mixed model with visit (14Day, 6-12Mon) as fixed effect, patient as a random effect, and age and sex as covariates. The ratio of imaging markers and assessment scores (6-12Mon14Day) were calculated to examine longitudinal changes over time.\nLogistic regression with stepwise selection was used to develop prediction models for binary memory problems (RPQ rating  2) at the 6-12Mon visit, including socio-demographic (Age, Sex, Education), clinical information (GCS, CT or MRI findings), and glymphatic imaging markers (WM-ePVS, BG-ePVS, ALPS index) at the 14Day visit as independent variables.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "To our knowledge, this study represents the first longitudinal investigation of changes in glymphatic imaging markers following clinical TBI. We focused on two promising and potentially widely available markers: the DTI-ALPS index and ePVS burden. Our key findings are as follows: (1) White matter ePVS burden and ALPS index are significantly correlated with age, as expected. (2) High white matter ePVS burden measured acutely following TBI is significantly associated with a higher number of postconcussion symptoms, particularly memory problems. (3) The increase in the ALPS index from the acute phase (14Day) to the chronic phase in patients with mTBI correlates with improvement in sleep measures. Furthermore, incorporating WM-ePVS burden and the ALPS index from the acute visit into patients basic clinical information enhances the prediction of chronic memory problems.\nThe PVS is an anatomical compartment that surrounds brain vascular structures (36). The CSF-filled PVS becomes visible on MRI when enlarged, indicating impaired glymphatic function (31,36). Enlarged PVS has been recognized as a hallmark of TBI since 2005 (72). Recent studies have reported increased ePVS in moderate-tosevere TBI patients (73), special operations force soldiers with a history of mTBI (41), and Vietnam War veterans with a history of TBI (74). In moderate-to-severe TBI patients, higher ePVS burden is associated with bilateral lesions and worse verbal memory (73). In Vietnam War veterans, high white matter ePVS is associated with poor verbal memory and elevated CSF tau levels, possibly implying impaired waste clearance (74). In another study in IraqAfghanistan veterans, higher white matter ePVS was found to be associated with the number of mTBI sustained in the military, poor sleep, and severity of post-concussive symptoms (40). In our mTBI population shortly after injury, no significant differences in ePVS burden compared to the controls were observed, but higher white matter ePVS burden was associated with acute post-injury symptoms, particularly memory problems. These findings align with recent literature on ePVS post-TBI, suggesting that acute changes in the glymphatic system may lead to more severe symptoms. Alternatively, pre-existing conditions may contribute to increased ePVS (36,75) in mTBI patients, predisposing them to higher post-concussion symptoms and memory problems. Chronic ePVS burden did not correlate with symptoms at 6 -12 months post-injury, possibly indicating active recovery compensating for acute structural glymphatic changes.\nLongitudinal changes in the white matter ePVS were not observed in the overall mTBI population or among patients with or without acute memory problems. However, the basal ganglia ePVS burden significantly increased from acute to chronic stages, although no other associations with symptoms were found, either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. The basal ganglia region is commonly associated with ePVS (75), and increased basal ganglia ePVS has been linked to cerebral small vessel diseases in gait disturbance (76), and cognitive decline in early-stage Parkinsons Disease (77). This suggests vulnerability to vascular and glymphatic ROC curve for two logistic regression models predicting patient memory problems at the 6-12Mon visit (defined as RPQ rating  2). Model 1 used socio-demographic and clinical information, while Model 2 added 14Day glymphatic imaging measures. Both models were developed using step-wise selection. Model 1 included Education and CT or MRI findings, whereas Model 2 included Education, CT or MRI findings, WM-ePVS, and ALPS. The models were compared using the bootstrap method.\nchanges in this region. The stable nature of white matter ePVS over time aligns with previous reports indicating temporal stability over long follow-up periods (36 months) (75). Challenges in automatic ePVS segmentation in the basal ganglia, due to reduced T1 weighted signal contrast, may contribute to variability and the lack of correlations with age and symptoms. Previous TBI studies have similarly reported limited findings regarding basal ganglia ePVS (39,74).\nThe ALPS index measures diffusion activity specifically along the medullary veins (33), providing a sample of glymphatic activity in the brain. Despite only representing a fraction of overall glymphatic diffusion, DTI-ALPS has gained popularity, particularly due to the widespread availability of diffusion data in MRI of TBI. Reports of ALPS changes post-TBI primarily stem from retrospective studies, mostly showing reduced ALPS index in TBI patients compared to controls (52)(53)(54). Lower ALPS index correlates with subarachnoid hemorrhage (52), verbal memory, attention and executive functions (52,76), and high blood levels of neurofilament light (NfL) chain ( 53), a typical TBI marker. However, Dai et al. observed increased ALPS in a group of 161 mTBI patients at an acute post-injury time (average of 5.6 days, mostly within 14 days) (55), suggesting dynamic glymphatic activity changes post-TBI. In our study, no significant ALPS differences between control and mTBI groups were found at acute or chronic time points. However, longitudinal changes in the ALPS indexes were significantly associated with concurrent changes in sleep quality over time. Improvement in the sleep conditions correlated with increased glymphatic diffusion activity, indicating a potentially tight connection between sleep and glymphatic function (39,46,61,78,79). These findings underscore the potential of ALPS index as a promising glymphatic imaging marker linked to changes in sleep conditions following TBI, with sleep possibly mediating TBI outcomes (80)(81)(82)(83).\nSignificant age-related correlations were observed for both white matter ePVS burden and ALPS index, indicating higher ePVS burden and lower ALPS index with older age across both control and mTBI groups. While age-related decline in glymphatic function is well documented (19,47,84), our study did not reveal differences in age-related slopes for these glymphatic imaging markers between the control and mTBI groups. Despite TBI being associated with accelerated aging effects, our findings suggest that this effect may not manifest within the early chronic phase post-TBI (6-12 months), indicating a potentially longer timeframe for accelerated aging to develop.\nGiven that both are considered glymphatic imaging markers, a significant correlation between the ALPS index and white matter ePVS burden was found in the control population, with high ALPS index corresponding to low ePVS burden. However, this relationship was not evident in mTBI patients at either time point. When incorporating glymphatic imaging markers into prediction models for chronic memory problems, acute white matter ePVS and ALPS emerged as significant variables, alongside patient education levels and the presence of CT or MRI findings. Integration of these acute glymphatic imaging markers, derived from clinically available sequences (T1w, T2w, and DTI), may significantly enhance prediction models, suggesting a potential impact of acute glymphatic function on TBI recovery. These findings highlight ePVS burden and ALPS as unique measures of glymphatic function, serving as complementary imaging markers to assess both structural and functional activity aspects of the glymphatic system.\nPractical considerations regarding glymphatic imaging markers include ePVS quantification and ALPS estimation. ePVS evaluation traditionally relied on qualitative assessment, limiting accuracy and scalability. Recent studies have adopted automatic segmentation algorithms for larger datasets (32,45,85,86), emphasizing the critical importance of image quality for successful segmentation. Motion artifacts and low signal-to-noise ratio can degrade segmentation quality, leading to potential overestimation of ePVS burden. Manual inspection is essential to ensure data quality. Despite the challenges, ePVS burden remains a robust and stable parameter. Rigorous DTI preprocessing, such as eddy current correction and denoising, improves ALPS index estimation. However, the relationship between sleep cycles and glymphatic activity may contribute to ALPS variability throughout the day, making MRI timing crucial in retrospective designs. Future studies should explore ALPS variability during different times of the day and consider MRI timing in their prospective designs.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the control group included both orthopedic patients and healthy controls, potentially introduce trauma-related confounds. Recruitment challenges, such as MRI compatibility issues with orthopedic injuries, made it difficult to exclusively use orthopedic controls for acute imaging, leading us to supplement with healthy controls. While we found no significant differences in glymphatic markers between these groups, trauma-related factors could still influence the results. Second, we did not observe significant symptom improvement in mTBI patients, possibly due to a selection bias favoring those with persistent symptoms. This finding aligns with larger studies like the TRACK-TBI study (10), suggesting that persistent symptoms at one-year post-injury are common. Our study relied on self-reported symptoms, so an important next step is to use more objective memory tests. Third, there are other underlying health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular burden, blood pressure, diabetes), or rehabilitation activities undertaken during study visits may impact the glymphatic function and memory post-TBI. Forth, the relatively small sample size highlights the need for larger studies to better investigate longitudinal glymphatic changes and their role in TBI outcomes. Future research should aim to include a larger and more diverse TBI population to elucidate the role of glymphatic function more accurately in TBI recovery.",

      "text": "In summary, our longitudinal study using DTI-ALPS and ePVS burden markers reveals significant correlations with age, and high post-TBI ePVS burden is linked to increased symptoms, especially memory problems. An increase in the ALPS index correlates with improved sleep from the acute to chronic stages. Combining these markers with clinical data improves the prediction of chronic memory problems, highlighting their distinct roles in assessing glymphatic structure and activity. Early assessment of glymphatic function could be crucial for understanding TBI recovery and developing targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the microstructural integrity of white matter (WM) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) among Han Chinese elderly using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique, and to investigate the relationship between WM abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction. Sixty-four subjects (23 mild probable AD, 20 amnestic MCI, and 21 age-matched normal controls) who did not have visible WM lesion burden were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were measured in normal-appearing WM (NAWM) using DTI with 64 encoding directions. The results were correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI). Statistical analysis showed the FA value in parietal WM was significantly lower in MCI compared to NC (P0.001), and further decreased in AD compared to MCI (P0.005). The lower FA and elevated mean diffusivity values were found in temporal WM, frontal WM, parahippocampal and posterior cingulate fibers of AD group compared to MCI and NC (all P0.01). Canonical correlation analysis showed that the parietal FA values measured from all subjects were significantly correlated with the scores of CASI and MMSE (P0.01). The results indicated that DTI can detect microstructural WM abnormalities in AD and amnestic MCI, and the measures were correlated with cognitive performance. In MCI, the abnormality was found to be limited within the parietal WM; and in AD a more widespread alteration was found in other brain regions as well.",

      "text": "(Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 2010;24:317-324)\nM any neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that there are significant losses in gray matter (GM) from the brains of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD), especially in the hippocampus and other medial temporal structures. 1,2 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally considered as a transitional state between normal aging and early AD, and significant atrophy was also found in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex of MCI patients compared with normal aging controls. 3 In addition to the GM atrophy observed in MCI and AD, white matter (WM) abnormalities have been initially reported by Kantarci et al 4 and by many other groups using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique.\nDTI is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique, which can be used to measure the microstructure abnormalities of WM in vivo by measuring the diffusion (or, the Brownian motion) of water molecules. The two most commonly reported parameters that can be measured by DTI are the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean diffusivity (MD). In structured tissues, this motion of water diffusion is restricted by many factors, including cell membranes, axonal membranes and cytoskeletal structures, especially the myelin fibers. The relative preference of the diffusion along the fiber direction is called anisotropy, and the degree of anisotropy is given as fractional anisotropy (FA), which is used as a measure for WM integrity. MD is a measure of randomized mean water diffusion in all directions. It can be used as a measure of alterations of brain tissues. 567 The changes in these two DTI indices (FA and MD) in AD patients compared with normal age-matched controls have been investigated in temporal, frontal, and parietal WM, 8910111213 parahippocampal gyrus, 14 hippocampus 15 and corpus callosum. 10,14,16 The changes in MCI patients have also been investigated in the parahippocampal gyrus, 14,17 hippocampus, 15,18 and parietal WM. 12,19,20 The changes in the posterior cingulate fibers 14,21,22 have also been reported in AD and MCI patients using color-coded FA maps. These WM alterations may be explained by the loss of myelin and axons, reactive astrocytosis, 232425 and possible DNA fragmentation. 262728 Another very important indication of aging-related WM damage is the presence of WM lesions or WM hyperintensities shown on MRI, which have been validated with postmortem findings. 24,29,30 As described above, although many studies have reported the microstructural WM changes in AD and MCI patients, the extent of WM lesion burden in their subject cohorts were rarely reported, even in those focusing on normal appearing white matter (NAWM). 12 Therefore, the purpose of the present study was: (1) to investigate whether there were any microstructural WM changes in MCI and AD patients compared to normal age-matched controls with specific WM changes rating scale; (2) to explore the relationship between the WM abnormalities and cognitive performance of these subjects with various degree of cognitive impairments.",

      "text": "This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Peking University Institute of Mental Health (PKU-IMH). Informed consent was obtained from each subject. The subjects were recruited from the PKU-IMH Dementia Care and Research Center, including the memory clinic cohort and the community aging cohort. Two neuroradiologists (JL and HY) evaluated both T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images and reached a consensus determination about whether there were visibly significant WM lesion burdens. According to The Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) rating scale of the European Task Force, 31 5 brain regions (frontal, parieto-occipital, temporal, the infratentorial area and the basal ganglia) were rated with four-point rating: 0-no lesion, 1-focal lesion, 2-beginning confluence of lesions, 3-diffuse involvement of the entire region, with or without involvement of U fibers. Subjects with visibly significant WM lesions rating scores 2 and 3 in any part of the regions were excluded. Subjects with structural abnormalities that could result in dementia, such as cortical infarction, tumor, or subdural hematoma, or who had undergone treatment or had a concurrent illness other than dementia that might interfere with cognitive function, were also excluded. A total of 243 subjects who had undergone a research brain MRI scan protocol were evaluated, and only 64 subjects (23 AD patients, 20 MCI individuals and 21 normal controls) met the inclusion criteria and were selected for this study, as illustrated in Figure 1. All subjects were Han Chinese and right-handed. According to the survey report of the fifth national census data, the Han Chinese consist 91.6 of the total population in China. 32 The comparison of the demographic data among the three groups, including age, sex, and education are shown in Table 1.\nAll MCI and AD patients were participants of the Dementia Care and Research Center longitudinal studies. Each patient received a clinical examination, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and routine laboratory tests approximately every 6 months. The cognitively normal elderly controls underwent the examinations and tests annually. All subjects received an annual brain MRI scan (including DTI).\nThe clinical diagnosis of AD was made according to the criteria for dementia cited in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) 33 and the criteria for AD from the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and the StrokeAlzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA). 34 The clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI was made according to the criteria established by Petersen. 35 The directed memory score of clinical memory scale (CMS) 36 had to be below 1.5 standard deviation of the mean score of the age-, sex and education-matched normal controls. However, their social and daily functions were still maintained above the impairment criteria for dementia. The healthy controls had no complaints of cognitive problems and no evidence of cognitive deficits from neuropsychological testing.",

      "text": "The DTI images were processed offline, using the DTI Task Card, Version 1.71, (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) to create the color-coded FA maps and the MD maps. MD was calculated as (DxxDyyDxy)3, mm 2 s and FA was calculated as the standard deviation of eigenvalues from the mean eigenvalue normalized by square norm of eignvalues.\nAll ROIs were traced by one rater (JL). The area of the ROI was 16 or 40 mm 2 depending on the size of analyzed white matter regions. The ROIs of 40 mm 2 were placed in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, bilaterally on the reference DTI images acquired without diffusion gradients (b0smm 2 ). For most regions we used the ROI defined by Bozzali et al 8 and Zhang et al, 14 as illustrated in Figure 2. The temporal WM ROIs were placed on 3 contiguous slices of middle temporal gyrus. The frontal WM ROIs were placed on 4 contiguous slices of middle frontal gyrus that show the full view of the lateral ventricle. The parietal WM ROIs were placed on 4 contiguous slices, starting from the most superior slice on which the centrum semiovale was visible and onto the next 3 inferior slices. The occipital ROIs were placed on the optic radiations on 3 contiguous slices starting from the most inferior slice where the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle was seen. The placement of the ROI was carefully done to minimize the partial volume averaging from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the surrounding gray matter. The corpus callosum ROIs (genu and splenium) were placed on the reference DTI images acquired without diffusion gradients (b0smm 2 ) and the ROIs of 16 mm 2 were used. They were placed on 4 contiguous slices that show the full view of the lateral ventricle.\nFor the smaller WM structures in the fibers near the parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior and posterior cingulate gurus, smaller ROIs of 16 mm 2 were used. They were placed on the color-coded FA maps to ensure that the ROI was within the WM tracts so as to minimize contamination from the adjacent structures, as also illustrated in Figure 2. The parahippocampal ROI was placed on the slice on which the full view of the hippocampal formation was seen. The posterior and anterior cingulate ROIs were placed on the slice where the middle level of the dorsal curve of the cingulum was seen.\nThe intra-rater reliability was evaluated based on two ROI drawings made by the same rater (JL). The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ranged from 0.88 to 0.96 for different brain regions. The measures from two ROI drawings of each region were averaged to calculate the mean value. For the structure where ROIs were drawn on several slices, the measurements from ROIs on these slices were averaged. For each structure where the ROI was drawn bilaterally, the measured FA and MD values from bilateral ROIs were averaged. For each structure, only one final FA value and one final MD value were used in the group comparison and the correlation analysis with cognitive performance score.",

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was deployed to compare the age, educational level, scores of MMSE and CASI (the total score and specific cognitive domain scores), and the FA and MD values measured by DTI among the three groups. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied for post hoc tests. Canonical correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between the variables of cognitive functions and DTI-based FA and MD measurements. Canonical dimensions, also known as canonical variates, that were significant were generated. As the variables in the model had different standard deviations, the standardized canonical coefficients, allowing for easier comparisons among the variables, were interpreted in a manner analogous to interpreting standardized regression coefficients. Only standardized canonical coefficients with absolute value greater than 0.30 were reported herein. The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 13.0 (Chicago, IL).

    "Canonical Correlation Between FA and MD and Scores of MMSE and CASI": {
      "text": "Concerning the relationship between the general cognitive function (total score of MMSE and CASI) and FA and MD values, tests of dimensionality for the canonical correlation analysis indicated that only canonical dimension was statistically significant (canonical correla-tion0.820, Wilks0.227, w 2 77.963, df36, P0.000). For the general cognitive variables, the canonical dimension was most strongly influenced by the total score of FIGURE 2. Locations of the ROI placed on normal-appearing white matter on the reference T 2 -weighted images acquired by the DTI sequence (b0smm 2 ) (1temporal WM, 2occipital WM, 3frontal WM, 4genu of corpus callosum, 5splenium of corpus callosum, 6parietal WM); and on the color-coded FA maps (7parahippocampal fiber, WM; 8anterior cingulate fiber, 9posterior cingulate fiber, Red: WM tracts along left-to-right direction; Green: anterior-to-posterior direction; Blue: superior-to-interior direction). The ROI size is 40 mm 2 for WM in four brain lobes, and a smaller ROI of 16 mm 2 is used for WM of smaller structures, including genu and splenium of corpus callosum, and parahippocampal, anterior and posterior cingulate fibers. CASI (standardized canonical coefficients À0.315) and MMSE (standardized canonical coefficients À0.706). For the FA and MD variables, the canonical dimension was most strongly influenced by the FA value of parietal white matter (standardized canonical coefficients À0.436). These results indicated that microstructural WM change in parietal lobe was significantly correlated with general cognitive function. As for the relationship between CASI cognitive domain performance and the FA and MD values, tests of dimensionality for the canonical correlation analysis, indicated that only two canonical dimensions were statistically significant. Dimension 1 had a canonical correlation of 0.897 between the sets of variables, and dimension 2 had a canonical correlation of 0.825.\nAs illustrated in Table 2, dimension 1 was most strongly influenced by short-term memory (À 0.923), and comprised of FA values of temporal WM (À0.475) and parietal WM (À 0.342), and MD value of parahippocampal gyrus (0.403), indicating the short-term memory was strongly correlated with FA values of temporal and parietal WM, and MD value of parahippocampal gyrus.\nFor the cognitive measurement, dimension 2 was influenced by long-term memory ( À0.507), concentration ( À0.816), language (0.365) and verbal fluency (0.457). FA values of parietal WM ( À0.554), occipital WM ( À0.366) and parahippocampal gyrus (0.512), and the MD values of parietal WM (À0.646), splenium of corpus callosum (0.408) and posterior cingulate gyrus (À 0.444) were the dominating variables for dimension 2 (Table 3). This suggested that cognitive functions such as long-term memory, concentration, language and verbal fluency was associated with FA values of parietal and occipital WM and parahippocampal gurys, and MD values of parietal WM, splenium of corpus callosum and posterior cingulate gyrus.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "We found that FA values decreased in parietal WM in MCI, and further decreased in AD. The microstructural WM changes represented with decreased FA and elevated MD were more widespread in temporal WM, frontal WM, parahippocampal and posterior cingulate fibers in AD. In addition the FA and MD values measured from all subjects were significantly correlated with subjects cognitive performance.\nPrevious diffusion-weighted and DTI studies have shown abnormality in WM integrity in temporal, frontal, parietal WM, posterior cingulum and the splenium of corpus callosum among AD patients and MCI individuals. 891011121314 We found that the MCI individuals had significantly lower FA values in the parietal WM compared with the NC group, and in the AD group the parietal FA value was further decreased. The results are consistent with previous reports investigating microsturctural WM changes using the DTI techniques. 12,19 Parietal WM tracts connect the superior temporal gyrus, the frontal cortex, and the cingulate gyrus, and thus play a very important role in the management of cognitive function. They are involved in the complex intermingling of networks, 42 such as the frontalparietal network that is believed to be associated with visual-spatial working memory, and the temporal-parietal network that is related to reading ability. Other studies have also demonstrated that the parietal lobe, occipitalparietal, and temporal-parietal regions may be associated with the early breakdown of neural networks in MCI. 43 A functional imaging study using PET (positron emission tomography) also reported that the reduction of glucose uptake in parietal cortical areas in MCI may predict the conversion from MCI to AD. 44 The frontal-parietal coupling of the delta and alpha rhythms were abnormal in MCI individuals. 45 We also found significant correlations between the FA values in parietal WM and several cognitive performance scores measured by CASI and MMSE. These results suggest that parietal WM alterations may occur in very early stages of cognitive impairment and may be an early predictor for the development of AD. To further verify the predictive role of these findings, a longitudinal study to follow the disease progression of the subject cohort is needed.\nOur observations that WM in the parahippocampal and posterior cingulate fibers were more severely compromised in AD compared to both NC and MCI provide evidence to support the idea that microstructural WM damage in the Papez-circuit is involved in AD. 14,21 The posterior cingulate fibers connecting the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus are an integral part of the cholinergic system, which is known to be affected in Alzheimers disease. 46 Previous functional MRI studies have provided evidence to support that the disconnection of the Papez-circuit is related to episodic memory performance. 47 In our study, we found that the decreased FA values in WM of parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate fibers were significantly correlated with the scores of MMSE and CASI. These results suggest that the loss of anisotropy in the posterior cingulate fibers and WM of parahippocampal gyrus is related to cognitive decline in the development of AD, and thus may be associated with the pathological changes involved in AD.\nWe also found that FA values in parietal, temporal, and frontal WM were significantly correlated with cognitive performance as measured with CASI and MMSE, as well as domain scores of CASI. The AD patients have poorer performance in tests of episodic memory function and executive function, The results suggest that microstructural WM alterations in parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes may compromise the complex cognitive function involving multiple brain lobes, as also demonstrated by previous DTI studies. 48 These findings support the idea that impaired WM integrity in the brain parallels cognitive deterioration, and that the DTI technique can provide an important sensitive method to detect these early microstructural changes. We used CASI in this study, which provides a mini-comprehensive neuropsychological test for assessment of multiple domains (memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and language, etc.) 40 and has been used in cross-cultural studies. 49,50 Further explorations with other neuropsychological battery tests are encouraged to demonstrate the relationship between microstructural white matter changes and cognitive performance. Concerning the potential confounding effect of microvascular events, we selected study participants with a low rating scale of ARWMC. Therefore, our findings of the microstructural WM changes in different brain regions are suggestive of neurofibrillary degeneration secondary to neuronal loss in the brain regions that are involved in performing the high level cortical functions. However, as the neurodegenerative condition and the myelin breakdown 29,51,52 may also contribute to WM abnormality, the findings need to be interpreted cautiously.\nOur study has several limitations. The first concern is the accuracy of the results measured from small ROIs. Although the ROI was carefully placed on the fiber tracts based on color-coded FA maps, it may have inevitably contained some gray matter or CSF, and the corresponding measurement may not be purely from the white matter. Secondly, the subjects were selected based on a neuroradiologists visual assessment of no significant WM lesion burden. It would be interesting to measure the WM lesion volume quantitatively, and to select subjects based on these measurement values. Future studies may be performed investigate the relationship between the WM lesion burden and the microstructural alterations (FA and MD) measured by DTI. Lastly, this is a cross-sectional study, and the design limits the power to examine the predictive value of WM alterations in different brain regions for disease progression, for example, the transition from normal aging to MCI and eventually to AD. All participating subjects in this study will continue to be followed to obtain longitudinal disease progression data, and in the future the measured DTI parameters may be correlated with disease conversion status.\nIn conclusion, we found that the WM abnormality was primarily limited within the parietal region in MCI compared to NC; and in AD patients the abnormality was found in most studied brain regions, including the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes, and the parahippocampal and the posterior cingulate fibers. The microstructural alterations of WM were associated with cognitive performance measured by MMSE and CASI. These observations demonstrate that DTI may be used to detect early microstructural WM changes in elderly subjects without visible WM lesion burden, and that different patterns are associated with progression of cognitive impairment from NC to MCI to AD. This finding warrants further studies to explore the sensitivity and specificity of using the WM alterations for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for the prediction of disease progression.",

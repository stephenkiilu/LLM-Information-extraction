    "abstract": "Introduction: Huntingtons disease (HD) is associated with progressive loss of caudate and white matter volume and integrity. Our aim was to systematically assess interactions between these changes and genetic markers of disease progression; we are not aware of previous studies in which this has been explicitly tested. Methods: Tract-based spatial statistics were used to assess: (a) differences between the white matter diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) of 17 premanifest and 19 early manifest HD gene carriers and 21 controls, and (b) the relationships between diffusion metrics, caudate and total white matter volume, and disease burden score and CAG repeat length. Caudate and total white matter volumes were quantified using FIRST and SIENAX respectively. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess which of the imaging metrics predicted disease severity in the HD subjects. Results: Diffusion metrics were significantly altered in premanifest and early HD gene carriers in comparison with controls throughout the white matter skeleton. Correlations between diffusion and volumetric metrics and disease progression were also present. Together, caudate volume and mean white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity predicted disease burden score in the HD subjects. Conclusions: The diffusion properties of white matter are extensively altered in HD, and are associated with markers of HD severity, and with caudate and white matter volumes. The correlation between diffusion metrics and white matter volume is stronger in HD subjects than in controls, but there is no such significant interaction for the correlation between diffusion and caudate volume: we propose that many of the changes in white matter diffusion in HD occur as a normal physiological response to pathological caudate volume loss. We have defined the extent to which mean white matter fractional anisotropy, white matter volume and caudate volume are associated with disease burden score.",

      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal dominant inheritance of an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat within the Huntingtin (HTT) gene (The Huntingtons Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). Clinical disease onset is typically in late-middle age and comprises motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Novak  Tabrizi, 2010). The pathological hallmark of HD is loss of the striatal medium spiny neurons (Vonsattel et al., 1985), and striatal volume loss is the earliest and most characteristic structural abnormality seen using brain imaging (Aylward et al., 1994;Tabrizi et al., 2009). As the disease progresses, histological and structural brain changes become widespread: structural imaging reveals extensive basal ganglia, cortical and white matter volume loss (Rosas et al., 2003;Tabrizi et al., 2009Tabrizi et al., , 2011Tabrizi et al., , 2012)). Robust quantification of imaging changes is important in the development of HD biomarkers, and hence as part of the development of putative new disease-modifying therapies.\nCAG repeat length can be quantified through genetic testing and accounts for 50e70 of variance in the age of onset of clinically manifest disease (Wexler et al., 2004). The relationship with manifest disease progression is less well-defined; CAG repeat length appears to be less strongly associated with clinical disease progression than with the age of disease onset (Ravina et al., 2008;Rosenblatt et al., 2006). Individuals at risk of inheriting the expanded HD gene because of their family history can elect to undergo predictive genetic testing: those who are found to carry the expanded gene on predictive testing but who do not yet have any symptoms of the disease are known as premanifest, or prodromal, HD gene carriers. Once a gene carrier develops characteristic HD motor signs, he or she is said to have manifest HD (Huntington Study Group, 1996).\nMuch neuroimaging research in HD has focussed on the identification of biomarkers of disease progression. Brain imaging has also shed much light on the underlying pathology of HD, and there are many imaging studies in the literature which illustrate this (Bohanna, Georgiou-Karistianis, Hannan,  Egan, 2008;Kloppel et al., 2009). Historically, much of the focus of such studies has been on grey matter volume loss, especially subcortical atrophy, but it is now clear that HD also affects white matter. Both white matter volume loss (Paulsen et al., 2006;Rosas et al., 2006;Tabrizi et al., 2009) and altered white matter diffusion metrics (Della Nave et al., 2010;Douaud et al., 2009;Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008;Magnotta et al., 2009;Mascalchi et al., 2004;Muller et al., 2011;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2006;Stoffers et al., 2010;Weaver et al., 2009) have been documented in premanifest and manifest HD subjects. Diffusion metrics are used to characterise the diffusion of water molecules within tissue: fractional anisotropy is a measure of the coherence, or dispersion, of water diffusion, whereas diffusivity is a measure of the magnitude of water diffusion. Mean diffusivity is a directionally averaged measure of water diffusion. Neither white matter volume nor diffusion metrics are specific to separable biological components of the neurodegenerative process, but imaging measures of white matter volume loss indicate macroscopic tissue loss, whereas altered diffusion metrics reflect loss of microscopic tissue structure (Beaulieu, 2002;Pierpaoli, Jezzard, Basser, Barnett,  Di Chiro, 1996;Ulug, Moore, Bojko,  Zimmerman, 1999). In HD, the cellular changes underlying white matter damage are not fully understood, but might include any or all of: intrinsic axonal degeneration; loss of white matter organisation or density e.g., through inflammation; or demyelination (Rosas et al., 2006).\nAltered diffusion within white matter suggestive of degeneration in this tissue has previously been shown crosssectionally in both premanifest and HD subjects compared with controls at a group level (Della Nave et al., 2010;Douaud et al., 2009;Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008;Magnotta et al., 2009;Mascalchi et al., 2004;Muller et al., 2011;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2010;Rosas et al., 2006;Stoffers et al., 2010;Weaver et al., 2009). However, we are not aware of any studies in which a differential group effect between premanifest and manifest subjects has been shown. This was explicitly tested for in the corpus callosum by one group (Rosas et al., 2010), but, although there were differences in the results of comparisons of premanifest and manifest data respectively with control data, no significant differences were found on direct comparison of the premanifest and manifest subjects. There is also no clear consensus over the anatomical extent of changes, with changes in different regions in different studies: affected regions include, for example, striatum (Douaud et al., 2009;Dumas et al., 2012;Kloppel et al., 2008;Magnotta et al., 2009;Mascalchi et al., 2004;Rosas et al., 2006), pallidum (Douaud et al., 2009;Kloppel et al., 2008;Rosas et al., 2006), thalamus (Douaud et al., 2009;Dumas et al., 2012;Rosas et al., 2006;Stoffers et al., 2010) and cortex (Dumas et al., 2012;Magnotta et al., 2009;Reading et al., 2005;Rosas et al., 2006). Furthermore, the relationship between diffusion metrics and disease progression is not well-characterised. In manifest subjects, Della Nave et al. ( 2010) demonstrated an association between mean diffusivity (but not fractional anisotropy) and disease duration. In premanifest gene carriers, Magnotta et al. (2009) found regions of grey and white matter in which estimated probability of disease onset within five years was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy, regions in which it was negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy, and regions in which it was positively correlated with mean diffusivity. Findings from both of these studies were, however, limited by uncorrected statistical associations. Discrepancies also exist in the results of longitudinal studies: in one study (Weaver et al., 2009), longitudinal change in fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity in white matter was shown over one year in a cohort of seven HD subjects compared with controls, whereas in other studies, no longitudinal change in diffusion metrics were seen. Specifically, no longitudinal change in mean diffusivity was seen over one year when tested in the caudate, putamen, thalamus and corpus callosum of 18 manifest subjects compared with controls (Sritharan et al., 2009), and no longitudinal change in MD was seen in the caudate or putamen of eight manifest HD subjects over two years (Vandenberghe, Demaerel, Dom,  Maes, 2009).\nThe main aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine altered white matter microstructure in premanifest and early manifest HD. The secondary aims were to investigate the relationship between diffusion metrics and volumetric and genetic measurements of disease progression in HD, and to compare those imaging metrics as predictors of disease severity. Disease severity was estimated using disease burden score disease burden score ¼ (CAG repeat length À 35.5) Â age (Penney, Vonsattel, MacDonald, Gusella,  Myers, 1997;Tabrizi et al., 2009); this was chosen because it allows both premanifest and manifest disease severity, or progression, to be assessed on the same continuous scale. The imaging measurements that were compared included: fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the core of white matter tracts; overall white matter volume, which is lost as HD progresses (Tabrizi et al., 2009(Tabrizi et al., , 2011;;2012;Thieben et al., 2002), and; caudate volume, the loss of which is the gold standard imaging marker of disease progression: in the Track-HD study, from which our study cohort was a subset, caudate volume loss was the most sensitive marker of longitudinal change in premanifest gene carriers (Tabrizi et al., 2011(Tabrizi et al., , 2012)).\nTract-based spatial statistics were used to assess the regional distribution of white matter diffusion abnormalities in cohorts of premanifest and manifest HD subjects, and to determine the association of these diffusion abnormalities with disease burden score. In addition, the association between diffusion metrics and CAG repeat length, from which disease burden score is derived, was also tested for premanifest and manifest HD subjects. This allowed direct comparison of these associations for each of the two groups.\nTract-based spatial statistics were then used to define correlations between white matter diffusion metrics and caudate and white matter volumes. Sritharan et al. (2009) have previously demonstrated an association between caudate width and caudate mean diffusivity in manifest HD subjects, and Vandenberghe et al. (2009) reported an inverse correlation between volume and mean diffusivity of the putamen in manifest HD subjects and a non-significant trend towards a corresponding association in the caudate. In neither of these studies were the same associations present in controls. We are not, however, aware of any other studies in which volumetric and diffusion metrics have been compared in this way in HD. In order to fully elucidate the relationship between caudate volume and diffusion metrics in white matter, these measures were examined in a healthy control group as well as in the premanifest and manifest HD cohorts.\nFinally, analyses were carried out to assess which of the imaging metrics was the strongest predictor of disease severity in the premanifest and manifest cohort: multiple regression analyses were carried out to compare the strength of association between mean white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, white matter volume and caudate volume with disease burden score in all the HD subjects.",

      "text": "Materials and methods (Huntington Study Group, 1996): the subjects in this study were deemed manifest if they had scores of 5 in the motor section of the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) (Huntington Study Group, 1996). The manifest subjects were significantly older than the premanifest subjects. This is common in HD studies: HD is a progressive disease so older subjects tend to have more advanced disease. Age was included in all analyses as a regressor to control for this. CAG repeat length, quantified through genetic testing, had a range of 39e48 repeats in the early manifest subjects (mean 42.9 AE 2.4) and 42e48 repeats in the premanifest HD subjects (mean 43.4 AE 2.2). There was no significant difference in CAG repeat length between the groups (p ¼ .58). Disease burden score, calculated as CAG repeat length À 35.5 Â age, had a range of 224e493.5 in the early manifest subjects (mean 358.71 AE 82.00) and 220e387.5 in the premanifest HD subjects (mean 309.08 AE 44.74).\nThe probability of a premanifest HD subject developing manifest disease within the next five years is a measure of specifically premanifest disease progression. Like disease burden score, it can be estimated from that individuals age and CAG repeat length (Langbehn, Brinkman, Falush, Paulsen,  Hayden, 2004). In this cohort, the probability of onset within five years ranged from .06 to .47, with a median probability of .32; the cohort included subjects ranging from those far from to those close to manifest disease onset. Manifest disease progression can be classified on the basis of functional ability, with early manifest disease stage 1 describing individuals who have mild signs of HD but no functional impairment, and stage 2 describing individuals who are mildly impaired in some activities by symptoms of HD but remain able to work (Shoulson  Fahn, 1979). In this cohort, 11 of the early manifest subjects had stage 1 disease, and 6 subjects had stage 2 disease.\nThe study was approved by the Institute of Neurologys combined University College LondonUniversity College London Hospital ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from every subject.",

    "Data analysis": {
      "text": "Diffusion imaging data preprocessing and analysis were carried out using standard pipelines. The diffusion data were preprocessed using the FDT tool, part of the FSL data analysis package (Smith et al., 2004). Data were first corrected for distortions caused by eddy currents and motion. After skullstripping, diffusion tensors were fit to the corrected data using dtifit. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values were derived from the tensors. Voxelwise statistical analysis of these data was then carried out using tract-based spatial statistics (Smith et al., 2006), also part of the FSL data analysis package.\nFirstly, all subjects fractional anisotropy data were coregistered to a standard space target image (FMRIB58_FA image) using a non-linear registration tool, then averaged to form a mean fractional anisotropy skeleton. All data were checked visually for distortions. The mean fractional anisotropy map was used to generate a white matter skeleton, which was subsequently thresholded to include voxels with mean fractional anisotropy greater than .2. Finally, the fractional anisotropy data for each individual subject were projected onto the skeleton and voxelwise statistical analyses were carried out on all voxels within the skeleton mask using non-parametric permutation tests (n ¼ 500). Family-wise error correction was used for multiple comparisons correction. The registration and skeletonisation parameters derived from the fractional anisotropy processing were then applied to the mean diffusivity data. As a further analysis, the mean of the white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures were calculated from all voxels within the skeleton for each subject.\nBrain volumes were calculated from the T1-weighted scans using FSL (Smith et al., 2004). Total caudate volumes (left þ right) were calculated using FIRST (Patenaude, Smith, Kennedy,  Jenkinson, 2011). The process was modified by using extracted brain tissue for the registration step to reduce registration errors. The FIRST algorithm registers all subjects scans to standard space, then uses shape and appearance models to segment subcortical grey matter structures (including the caudate). Due to registration errors arising from extraneous non-brain tissue, the FIRST process was modified to include a prior brain extraction step. The transformation required in the registration to standard space was estimated using these brain-extracted scans. FIRST was then carried out on the original whole-head scan applying the transform calculated previously. All registrations and segmentations were visually inspected for accuracy. Total white matter volumes were calculated using SIENAX (Smith et al., 2002). All FIRST and SIENAX registrations and segmentations were assessed visually. Total intracranial volume was estimated in MIDAS software using the technique of Whitwell et al. (Whitwell, Crum, Watt,  Fox, 2001). The total intracranial volume measurements had been calculated from data acquired two years prior to the data used for the rest of the analyses as part of another study. Total intracranial volume can be thought of as a measure of premorbid brain size and does not change over time; we were therefore able to re-use these measurements in our current study.\nData were then modelled using the general linear model and voxelwise statistics were carried out. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity data were modelled separately. Regressors of no interest in the general linear model included age, sex and total intracranial volume for all models. Categorical analyses were used to test for group differences between premanifest and manifest HD and control data, and in the relationships between diffusion and volumetric measurements, and regression analyses of the HD data were used to test for correlations between diffusion metrics and genetic markers of disease severity.\nMultiple linear regression analysis was carried out using MATLAB 7 R2010 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The outcome variable was disease burden score; mean white matter fractional anisotropy, mean white matter mean diffusivity, white matter volume and caudate volume were the tested predictors of interest. Age, gender and total intracranial volume were controlled for by including them as additional predictors. This analysis was used to test how much of the variance in disease burden score could be attributed to each of the imaging variables.\nFor all analyses, results with statistical significance of p  .05 are reported. For tract-based spatial statistics analyses, this was adjusted for family-wise error correction.",

Furthermore, this is the first time to our knowledge that a group difference between premanifest and manifest HD diffusion metrics has been demonstrated by direct comparison between the groups. Taken together, these findings support the notion of anatomically widespread and progressive HD-associated degeneration in white matter microstructure (though of course the specific cellular changes underlying white matter damage cannot be disentangled from these data). The difference in diffusion metrics between the premanifest and manifest HD subject groups is more anatomically extensive than that between the premanifest HD and control subject groups, suggesting that the diffusion profile of premanifest HD subjects is closer to that of controls than that of manifest subjects. Those regions in which loss of white matter coherence is seen in premanifest HD subjects in comparison with controls e right corpus callosum, right superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi and the left external capsule e might be the regions in which white matter degeneration begins, later becoming more anatomically extensive.

    "Association between diffusion and volumetric measures in HD and control subjects": {
      "text": "Strong associations between diffusion and volumetric measures clearly exist in both HD and control subjects (Fig. 6), but the differential strength of these associations and their relationship with HD gene status is less clear-cut. Smaller caudate volumes were associated with diffusion metrics that, in the patient cohort, would suggest loss of white matter coherence (Fig. 4); there was, however, no evidence of a differential association between the control and HD subjects, so it cannot be thought of as a specifically pathological finding. As discussed in our introduction, we are not aware of any previous reports of a correlation between caudate volume and diffusion metrics in healthy controls (Sritharan et al., 2009;Vandenberghe et al., 2009), but such an association is plausible and might reflect natural variation in volume and diffusion across the healthy population; larger studies would help to clarify this. It is also possible that similar changes in white matter microstructure occur in response to age-related caudate volume loss, for example (Gunning-Dixon, Head, McQuain, Acker,  Raz, 1998;Raz et al., 2003), though we are aware of no previous studies specifically testing for this in healthy subjects.\nAfter controlling for caudate volume, many of the group differences in diffusion were no longer statistically significant. There was a weak trend for fractional anisotropy to be more strongly correlated with caudate volume in the HD subjects than in the control subjects, but this did not reach statistical significance; follow-up studies with larger cohorts and greater statistical power would be required to explore this further. In the meantime, our results suggest that change in white matter microstructure in HD is related to change in caudate volume, and in those white matter tracts directly related to the caudate, it is possible that white matter degeneration occurs as a direct result of caudate atrophy, rather than independently.\nWhite matter volume was also correlated with diffusion metrics (Fig. 5), but, in contrast with the correlation between caudate volume and diffusion, there was a significant interaction in the correlation by subject group: white matter volume was more strongly correlated with fractional anisotropy in both the premanifest HD subjects and manifest subjects when each group was compared with controls. There was no significant interaction between the premanifest and manifest HD groups, and more limited interactions by subject group were seen in the correlation between mean diffusivity and white matter volume. After controlling for white matter volume, subject group differences in both fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity remained. Taken together, these findings suggest a disease-specific association between white matter volume and white matter microstructure in HD, with changes in white matter microstructure evident over and above changes in white matter volume; this would support the hypothesis that degeneration in white matter microstructure precedes macroscopic (volumetric) white matter change in HD, independent of normal ageing processes. Longitudinal studies examining both structural and diffusion metrics in the same cohort would be required to test this hypothesis.",

      "text": "Association between imaging metrics and disease burden score\nThe differences seen between the white matter diffusion metrics of the premanifest and manifest HD groups suggest that there is progressive loss of white matter microstructure in HD. While only longitudinal studies can confirm or refute this hypothesis, the associations that we have demonstrated between disease burden score, an estimated marker of disease severity, and diffusion metrics strongly support it. The results of the tract-based spatial statistics analysis show that this effect is anatomically widespread (Fig. 2). Similarly, the associations between CAG repeat length and white matter diffusion metrics support the idea that HD severity is linked to more severe white matter degeneration. Disease burden score is derived from CAG repeat length (and age); in using it, we test the effect of the component of HD severity or progression that is due to a linear effect of CAG repeat length. It should be noted however, that this is an imperfect measure of disease severity e variation in CAG repeat length only accounts for approximately 65 of variation in disease onset for example (Wexler et al., 2004); other genetic or environmental diseasemodifying influences are as yet unidentified e but it is a well-validated metric (Tabrizi et al., 2009) which is a useful proxy measure of disease progression. There was no difference between premanifest and manifest HD subjects in the correlation between white matter diffusion metrics and disease burden score, suggesting a constant rate of microstructural white matter degeneration in relation to CAGdependent disease progression; this could support the use of diffusion metrics as biomarkers of HD progression. The more anatomically limited association between CAG repeat length and diffusion metrics reinforces this, although this finding is more difficult to interpret: CAG repeat length is by definition invariant through life and can therefore be thought of as representing an individuals lifetime dose of exposure to the expanded HD gene, whereas disease burden score reflects a cumulative dose to date of exposure to the abnormal gene.\nTaken together, the results described above suggest that diffusion metrics might be effective biomarkers of HD severity. It is, however, unclear over what timescale diffusion metrics change in HD (Sritharan et al., 2009;Vandenberghe et al., 2009;Weaver et al., 2009); further longitudinal studies are needed to establish whether changes occur over a timeframe compatible with clinical trials. It is also unclear how much information the measurement of white matter diffusion metrics would add to that derived from the gold standard volumetric measure of caudate volume: longitudinal studies comparing volumetric and diffusion metrics are needed to elucidate the relationship between the two, but the results of our multiple regression analysis showed that in our cohort caudate volume and mean white matter diffusion metrics together significantly explained variance in disease burden score. Furthermore, there was a trend towards variance being explained by caudate volume and mean white matter mean diffusivity alone after controlling for the other variables. These results suggest that caudate volume and diffusion metrics, and perhaps mean diffusivity in particular, might be superior to white matter volume measurements as biomarkers to detect HD-associated change. Interestingly, partial correlation analyses carried out in a similar (though larger) HD cohort to test the relationships between caudate, putamen, ventricular and whole brain volumes and disease burden score showed significant associations between all the imaging metrics and disease burden score, but the strongest correlation was with caudate volume (Tabrizi et al., 2011); taken together, these studies underline the key association between caudate volume and disease burden score.\nOne caveat to interpretation of these results is that our regression analyses assume a constant and linear relationship between variables in the premanifest and manifest phase of HD. In our tract-based spatial statistics analyses, we detect no difference in the correlation between diffusion metrics and white matter volume and caudate volume between the premanifest and manifest HD subjects, supporting the assumption that the relationship remains constant throughout the disease course (or that, at least, any change in the relationship is small). However, other imaging metrics may not change at a linear rate in HD e whole brain and caudate atrophy rates, for c o r t e x 5 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 9 8 e1 1 2 example, vary over the disease course and may be higher in early manifest than premanifest HD subjects (Tabrizi et al., 2011) e so testing the interaction between volumetric and diffusion metrics along the course of the disease in a longitudinal study would be necessary to reveal the dynamics of these changes. Alongside this, studies to test the relationship between diffusion metrics and measurable clinical markers of disease severity (such as scores of motor or cognitive dysfunction) over time would also be informative building on previous imaging studies in which associations between diffusion metrics and clinical markers have been demonstrated in HD (Bohanna, Georgiou-Karistianis,  Egan, 2011;Bohanna, Georgiou-Karistianis, Sritharan, et al., 2011;Della Nave et al., 2010;Dumas et al., 2012;Sritharan et al. 2009).",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "We have shown that the diffusion properties of white matter are altered across an extensive, distributed anatomical area in HD, and that changes in diffusion metrics are associated with markers of HD severity. We have also shown positive correlations between caudate and white matter volumes and diffusion metrics; this association is stronger in HD subjects than in controls for the white matter correlation, but there is no such significant interaction for the caudate correlation: we therefore propose that many of the changes in white matter diffusion in HD occur as a normal physiological response to pathological caudate volume loss. Finally, we have defined the extent to which mean white matter fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, white matter volume and caudate volume are associated with disease burden score, and have demonstrated that, in our cohort, caudate volume and white matter diffusion metrics are significant predictors of disease burden score.",

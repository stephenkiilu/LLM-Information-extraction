    "abstract": "Aims: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is the most common neuroimaging manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease and is related to cognitive dysfunction or dementia. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism and effective indicators to predict WMH-related cognitive impairment. Methods : We recruited 22 healthy controls (HC), 25 cases of WMH with normal cognition (WMH-NC), and 23 cases of WMH with mild cognitive impairment (WMH-MCI). All individuals underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a standardized neuropsychological assessment. Automated Fiber Quantification was used to extract altered DTI metrics between groups, and partial correlation was performed to assess the associations between WM integrity and cognitive performance. Furthermore, machine learning analyses were performed to determine underlying imaging markers of WMH-related cognitive impairment. Results: Our study found that mean diffusivity (MD) values of several fiber bundles including the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were negatively correlated with memory function, while that of the anterior component of the right IFOF and the posterior and intermediate component of the right ILF showed significant negative correlation with MMSE and episodic memory, respectively. Furthermore, machine learning analyses showed that the accuracy of recognizing WMH-MCI patients from the WMH populations was up to 80.5 and the intermediate and posterior components of the right ILF and the anterior component of the right IFOF contribute the most. Conclusions: Changes in the properties of DTI may be the potential mechanism of WMH-related MCI, especially the right IFOF and the right ILF, which may become imaging markers for predicting WMH-related cognitive dysfunction.",

    "INTRODUC TI ON": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is an age-related clinical syndrome, manifesting as abnormal mood and gait, lacunar infarction, cognitive dysfunction, and Parkinsons disease. MRI manifestations include lacunar infarction, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. 1 White matter hyperintensities is perceived as the most common neuroimaging manifestation because WMH is visible in 80 of healthy people over 60 years and almost all the people over 90 years. 2 Different degrees of demyelination, gliosis and loss of fibers and oligodendrocytes are shown in the pathological examination of WMH. 3,4 Recent studies have found that WMH can lead to vascular cognitive impairment, and in some, may ultimately progress to dementia. 5 The underlying mechanism is highly controversial. Vascular risk factor load, damage to neurotransmitter systems, interruption of prefrontal subcortical loops, and cerebral hypoperfusion were proposed to explain the correlation between WMHs and cognitive decline. 567891011 However, patients with similar visual extensive WMH always manifested a variable severity of cognitive dysfunction and affected different cognitive domains. 12 Longitudinal follow-up studies also showed further deterioration of cognitive function over time in WMH patients with mild cognitive impairment. 13 Furthermore, loss of microstructural integrity of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) was associated with executive function, 14 which further suggested that WMH might be an extreme case of continuous spectrum of white matter (WM) damage. White matter tract disruption in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may lead to disconnections among cortico-cortical or cortico-subcortical pathways vital for some cognitive function. The socalled disconnection hypothesis may play a role in WMH-related cognitive impairment. 15,16 Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is appropriate for WM microstructure study. 17 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is currently the only noninvasive method that can effectively observe and track the WM fiber tracts in a living human brain. 18,19 Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are two quantitative measures of DTI that, respectively, detect the anisotropy and overall displacement of water molecule diffusion. 20,21 One approach to analyze DTI is voxel-based analysis (VBA), the core of which is making measurements of FA or other diffusion metrics in specific regions of interest (ROIs), thus conducting group comparisons. For example, Della Nave reported that a large cluster of increased MD in the corpus callosum and pericallosal WM was associated with impaired motor function. 22 It is noticeable that VBA is extremely sensitive to registration errors but may fail to achieve sufficient precision because of the diversity of tract sizes and shapes among individuals. 23,24 Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) emerges then, which integrates selective voxels onto the nearest location on a pseudoanatomical WM skeleton and reduces the residual misalignment by 10 without spatial resolution loss. 25 By using TBSS, Otsuka found that reduced diffusion anisotropy of the corpus callosum in patients with extensive leukoaraiosis may explain global cognitive impairment. 12 However, it still fails to guarantee that any voxel corresponds to the same tract across individuals as mean FA equalizes the particularity by dispersing the original changes in specific sections of specific tracts to the whole bundle, with the average voxel value significantly influenced by the artificial split of anatomical locations. 252627 Consequently, what conventional MRI reveals is only the tip of the iceberg of the total SVD-related WM damage and only when the disease has progressed to a serious extent can its neuroimaging markers be discovered. Tractography is thought to be the most accurate method for localizing fiber tracts at the individual level. Yet, there are still limitations: tractography depends on manual drawing of ROIs and averages diffusion properties on the entire WM tract. Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), a new algorithm that automatically identifies WM tracts with defined waypoint ROIs and makes measurements at anatomically equivalent locations along their trajectories, has enabled correct delineation of the WM tracts and detailed information for analysis. 28 Its superiority is mainly shown in four aspects: First, FA values vary at different locations within a tract but the shape of tract FA profile is still consistent among individuals; second, developmental alterations in FA can be localized to specific regions of fiber tracts; third, comparisons can be made between individual patients and healthy population norms to elucidate unique patient clinical features; finally, diverse behavioral outcomes can also be predicted by the behavioral tract profiles. Automated Fiber Quantification, serving as an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, has been applied to provide new insights into WM degeneration in mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimers disease patients. 29 The effect of hypertension on WM integrity and the correlation between the destruction of structural architecture of WM and cognitive impairment have also been revealed by AFQ.\nIn view of its several advantages, we also consider AFQ as an ideal analytic method in our study. We hypothesized that DTI parameters vary among different positions on the same fiber bundle and the localization-specific properties in WM integrity may contribute to WMH-related cognitive impairment. Considering that vascular cognitive impairment is recognized as a progressive condition from normal cognitive status to frank dementia, 30 early prediction and intervention play a pivotal role in the prevention of dementia, thus granting our study high significance. The p value was obtained by one-way ANOVA. Indicates a statistical difference between groups, P  .05.",

      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging is the only noninvasive method to measure the microstructural integrity of brain tissue by detecting the diffusion of water molecules in it. Fractional anisotropy, MD, AD, and RD are four common indicators. White matter hyperintensities is the most common neuroimaging manifestation of CSVD, which is related to cognitive dysfunction or dementia. Studies that focused on NAWM have also confirmed that the change in DTI metrics of NAWM always precedes the development of WMH and is associated with MCI. 14,38 Combined with the emergence of WMH penumbra theory, 39 we propose that direct visual WMH may be a manifestation of more extensive and subtle WM microstructural degeneration and those changes of the properties in DTI may be the potential mechanism of WMH-related MCI, as stated in the theory of cortical disconnection hypothesis. 15,16 To further explore and verify the mechanism, many efforts have been made using VBA or TBSS. 12,22 However, their results are inconsistent and controversial and were obtained from a perspective of brain region or the entire fiber tract only. So we conducted the research, and in this study, we first found: (a) the abnormal WM bundles in WMH patients by using the AFQ algorithm; (b) the correlation between the WM injury and cognitive impairment; and (c) the candidate fiber tract as an imaging marker for identifying WMH-related cognitive dysfunction.\nFirst, at the overall level of fiber bundles, FA decreased in only 6 of 16 patients with WMH compared with normal subjects; yet the difference between the WMH-NC and WMH-MCI subgroups did not reach statistical significance. However, MD increased in 13 of 16 fiber bundles in the WMH groups in comparison with the NC.\nFurthermore, four bundles showed a statistically significant difference between the WMH-MCI and WMH-NC, that is, the right ATR, the right IFOF, the right ILF, and the left SLF. This suggests that MD is more sensitive than FA in detecting the degree of WM damage, consistent with the study on Alzheimers disease. 40,41 The development of WMH is partly caused by focal ischemia, which may result in a decrease in tissue density and an increase in water diffusivity while maintaining underlying directional structure, and those outcomes cause an increase in MD when FA remains unchanged. 41,42 Partial correlation analysis showed that the MD values of several fiber bundles (left ATR, right ATR, left IFOF, right ILF, and right SLF) were negatively correlated with memory function in the WMH-MCI group, which indicated that the more serious the damage with WM microstructure, the worse is the memory ability. Many efforts have been made to explore the correlation between WM microstructure and cognitive function, but some controversies remain. One reason is inconsistencies in detailed anatomical definitions like IFOF whose origin and termination of fiber tract have not been determined accurately. 43 It was widely accepted that the IFOF connected the fronto-marginal gyrus and lateral orbito-frontal gyrus with the inferior occipital gyrus, the inferior part of the middle occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus, 44 but others proposed that the middle and posterior temporal lobes should be the posterior terminations of the IFOF. 45 Regarding this, postmortem dissection and DTI techniques suggested that the bundle should be segmented into different subcomponents which can give us a more comprehensive understanding about its connectional architectures and their relevance to cognitive domains. 43,46 For example, the damage of IFOF-1 originating from the polar part of the frontal lobe may explain its connection with memory function here. Besides, the natural crossing of the IFOF with other tracts like the ILF, SLF, and arcuate fascicle also makes the anatomy and function of certain bundles confusing. 43 The FA values of the crossing regions of the posterior portion of the bilateral IFOs with the bilateral CSTs became higher when most of the affected regions from NC to MCI to AD had a decreased FA 40 ; these results also call for a more location-specific approach for further research. Many studies obtained similar results suggesting that the integrity of ILF and SLF have an impact on memory. 474849 However, limited clinical data exist to inform the influence of ATR on episodic memory, while in rat experiments, it was found that rats with anterior thalamic lesions have difficulties with reference and working memory 50 ; thus, more research is needed to verify its reliability. distal cortex, connecting occipito-temporal (and parietal) areas to the frontal lobe through the externalextreme capsule region 51,52 which makes it more vulnerable to injury than other bundles. The polar part of the frontal lobe (BA10) is associated with many aspects of complex cognitive functions including episodic memory, social cognition, attention and multitasking and subcomponent analysis of IFOF gave the suggestion that these significant functions are primarily supported by WM connectivity between BA10 and IFOF. 43,53 Thomass finding that only the reduction in tract integrity of the right ILF and the right IFOF can lead to the face recognition impairment suggested that the right hemisphere is more prominent in some cognitive domains. 54 We also found that the right ILF showed a significant negative correlation with episodic memory in the posterior and intermediate component (nodes 26-58). The ILF links the anterior temporal lobe with the extrastriate cortex of the occipital lobe, running along the lateral and inferior wall of the lateral ventricle and was found to be correlated with semantic autobiographical memory. 55 Diffusion tensor imaging studies found that damaged microstructures of the ILF were significantly correlated with decreased memory function, 48,55 indicating that memory function depends on the connection integrity of the temporal lobe with other lobes such as the occipital lobe.\nWhat is interesting in Zemmouras finding is that it is the posterior portion of the ILF instead of the anterior portion that plays a prominent role in reading impairment, 56 which is consistent with our result that the posterior component of ILF was more vulnerable to injury. It also gave us a hint that different locations of the same fiber may be responsible for different cognitive domains. Despite these hypotheses, more work needs to be done to confirm the actual mechanism behind the phenomenon. 57 Besides, many studies have confirmed the relationship between the integrity of ILFIFOF and multiple cognitive functions including memory, reading, attention, and visual processing. 43,48,58,59 In conclusion, both the level of fiber bundles and the node level suggest that ILF and IFOF are key WM fiber tracts mediating certain cognitive functions and can be used as imaging markers for early recognition of WMH-related cognitive impairment.\nIn addition to FA and MD, other diffusion metrics like AD and RD were also employed in our study. AD reflects diffusion parallel to axonal fibers which may reflect axonal injury and RD captures perpendicular diffusion which is linked to demyelination. 42 MD in that they are all derived from the three identical eigenvalues of the tensor (λ1, λ2, and λ3), 60 higher sensibility of MD on catching WM degeneration had been found in Alzheimers disease. 40,42 We came to the same conclusion and also found that their ability to recognize cognitive impairment of WMH is not as strong as MD.\nThis study has some limitations.",

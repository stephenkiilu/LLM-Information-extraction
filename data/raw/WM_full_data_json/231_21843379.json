    "abstract": "Relatively new developments in MRI, such as functional MRI (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are rapidly developing into imaging modalities that will become clinically available in the near future. They have in common that their signal is somewhat easier to interpret than structural MRI: fMRI mirrors excess cerebral blood flow, in many cases representing brain activity, MRS gives the average volume concentrations of specific chemical compounds, and DTI reflects directedness of micro-anatomical structures, of particular use in white matter where fiber bundle disruption can be detected with great sensitivity. While structural changes in MRI have been disappointing in giving a diagnosis of sufficient sensitivity and specificity, these newer methods hold out hope for elucidating pathological changes and differentiating patient groups more rigorously. This paper summarizes promising research results that will yet have to be translated into real life clinical studies in larger groups of patients (e.g. memory clinic patients). Where available, we have tried to summarize results comparing different types of dementia.",

      "text": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique that measures changes in blood flow. The fMRI signal depends on blood oxygenation levels (BOLD), i.e. on changes in the concentration of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin in the blood, which differentially affect magnetic fields. Therefore, fMRI provides an indirect measure of neuronal activity based on the assumption that local increased energy demands -e.g. during a cognitive task -are associated with increased blood flow. Although there is still a debate on the exact nature and the meaning of BOLD (Arthurs and Boniface, 2002), brain activations with well-defined BOLD signal have been reliably obtained for a variety of brain functions, such as language, movement, hearing and memory.\nOne of the most prominent cognitive symptoms of Alzheimers disease (AD) is memory impairment. As medial-temporal lobes (MTL) and hippocampi are the earliest brain regions to show pathological changes in AD, fMRI studies investigating BOLD changes in AD patients have primarily focused on neuronal activity during memory tasks. fMRI studies using memory tasks have consistently shown a reduction in BOLD signal in MTL Correspondence should be addressed to: Professor K.

These results have been interpreted as evidence that the memory network involving MTL regions is disrupted by the neurodegenerative processes of AD.\nMore controversial are the findings showing BOLD changes in AD in other brain areas. fMRI studies in neocortical areas, particularly in frontal and prefrontal brain regions, have reported both increased (Sperling et al., 2003) and decreased (Small et al., 1999) BOLD signal relative to controls. While AD-associated BOLD signal reductions have been interpreted as further evidence of memory network disruption, ADrelated increases in the BOLD signal or the additional recruitment of brain regions not used by the healthy controls during the task, have been explained in terms of brain mechanisms to compensate for declining function in MTL regions (Prvulovic et al., 2005).\nVery few studies have used fMRI to investigate other cognitive domains in AD. BOLD signal abnormalities in AD were observed in motor and visual regions (Buckner et al., 2000), which are not directly affected by AD in the early stages of the disease. However, due to the small number of studies, these findings require further confirmation.\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with For both analyses a statistical threshold of p  0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons) was used (adapted from Filippini et al., 2009).\nLewy bodies (DLB) and vascular dementia (VaD), have been less extensively studied. Reduced BOLD signal in the occipito-temporal region was observed in DLB relative to AD and healthy controls when performing a visual-motion task (Sauer et al., 2006). Similarly, reduced BOLD signal was observed in clusters of regions in the frontal, temporal and cingulate cortices in FTD patients relative to AD during a memory task (Rombouts et al., 2003). However, these findings should be considered preliminary and need further confirmation.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. fMRI studies using memory paradigms have observed increased BOLD signal in MTL regions in MCI relative to both healthy controls and AD patients (Dickerson et al., 2005;Celone et al., 2006;Hamalainen et al., 2007;Kircher et al., 2007;Sperling, 2007). These have been interpreted as a compensatory strategy to counteract the pathological processes by recruiting additional neurons. BOLD signal reduction in MTL regions was also reported in MCI patients relative to healthy controls during a memory task (Machulda et al., 2003;Johnson et al., 2006). However, other studies have failed to replicate these results. Methodological issues may explain these inconsistencies: The definition of MCI is very broad, and recruitment of patients with different degrees of impairment, with various types of symptoms and with different age of onset may have confounded the results.\nGenes explain between 60 and 80 of the predisposition to develop AD, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the bestestablished risk factor (Li et al., 2008). APOE has three allelic variants (ε2, ε3, and ε4); the ε4 variant has been shown to increase the prevalence and lower the age of onset in AD patients. Functional imaging studies using task-based fMRI paradigms have consistently shown differential effects of the APOE genotype on the BOLD response, with the direction of change depending both on the specifics of the task used and on other AD risk factors (e.g. age and family history) (Trachtenberg et al., 2010) (Figures 1 and2). Increased hippocampal BOLD signal in ε4 carriers relative to non-carriers is a common feature reported in fMRI studies from early adulthood (Filippini et al., 2009;Dennis et al., 2010), i.e. decades before any cognitive or clinical deterioration (Filbey et al., 2010;Filippini et al., 2011).\nOne of the main advantages of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is that it does not rely on any specific task, as a particular task may be difficult for patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders to perform. rs-fMRI measures differences in spontaneous fluctuations in resting brain function.\nIts potential value has been demonstrated in clinical studies (Greicius et al., 2004;Sorg et al., 2007), which confirm that the BOLD signal is a sensitive measure to detect disease-related effects on brain function.\nFinally, the possibility of integrating fMRI with other techniques may help to further exploit the clinical potential of the BOLD measure. For example, fMRI combined with amyloid imaging may help to determine whether and to what extent amyloid deposition is associated with alterations in the BOLD signal, and thus directly link BOLD changes to pathological mechanisms.",

    "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy": {
      "text": "Spatial encoding of brain MRI signals is achieved by artificial magnetic field gradients (B 0 ) across the head, which result in measurably different magnetic resonance frequencies (Larmor frequencies) along the spatial dimension. The law linking magnetic field strength with resonance frequency is also exploited in a different fashion by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS): in a very stable and homogenous field, the molecular environment results in small fluctuations of field strength, which can be measured as slight differences in resonance frequency. While the frequency spectrum generated within a given volume should be a single peak dependent on the generated homogenous field B 0 , the actual signal appears as a dispersed spectrum, with different peaks attributable to chemical microenvironments, i.e. molecular groups (Figure 3). This effect has been used in analytical chemistry in vitro, but can also be used in vivo, by focusing on a limited brain volume at the time. The technique requires some expertise in shimming to generate a very homogenous magnetic field in the scanner and, of course, the appropriate software. While the usual spectra acquired are based on proton ( 1 H) MRS, there are other nuclei, e.g. 13 C to examine glutamine neurotransmission, 31 P to investigate membrane phosphate-containing compounds, and 17 F to label amyloid beta plaques.\nSince Lin et al. (2006) Unfortunately, but perhaps predictably, the focus of investigations has been mainly on scientifically novel approaches, where significance does not mean that a particular MRS measurement can be used to distinguish groups or predict prognosis, but only that patient and control data have not been sampled from the same underlying population, i.e. they can have a wide overlap. One of the largest recent 1 H-MRS studies was undertaken by Watanabe et al. (2010), who compared 52 healthy controls with 70 AD patients and 47 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI). They examined three important metabolites: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (MI) and choline compounds (Cho). NAA is a mainly intraneuronal marker of neuronal density and viability; MI is primarily located in glial cells and is used as a marker of gliosis; and Cho levels may reflect the damaged cholinergic neurons in AD or aMCI (Watanabe et al., 2010). AD patients had reduced bilateral hippocampal absolute NAA concentrations, with aMCI levels being intermediate between AD and controls. aMCI patients also had reduced concentrations of NAA in bilateral posterior periventricular and deep white matters (PDWM) and posterior cingulate gyrus, and had lower levels of Cho in the left posterior PDWM (Watanabe et al., 2010). Kantarci et al. (2009), in a cumulative study of patients examined at the Mayo Clinic Alzheimers Disease Research Center and Patient Registry, were able to compare 151 consecutively recruited subjects with MCI.\nSeventy-five patients with MCI developed dementia during follow-up. The best regression model for the prediction of dementia included age, sex, hippocampal volumes, 1 H-MRS NAAcreatine (Cr) ratios in posterior cingulate gyrus, and cortical infarctions. (Cr is related to general metabolism, is assumed to be relatively constant and, given the complications of determining absolute metabolite levels, is often taken as an internal reference value.) The adjusted hazard ratio for NAACr ratios was 1.5 (95 CI 1.0-3.0), so that MRS made a small independent contribution to the prognosis over two years (Kantarci et al., 2009). Finally, Fayed et al. (2010) examined 33 patients with AD and 54 with MCI. Ratios of NAACr and NAAMI showed a good correlation with the clinical dementia rating and global deterioration scale (GDS) in both the left occipital cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus, and ChoCr a weak correlation with GDS in the left occipital lobe. None of these studies actually used formal quality criteria for diagnosis (e.g. ROC). An interesting treatment study using galantamine was able to show increases of hippocampal glutamate MRS signals in ten AD patients (Penner et al., 2010).\nThe use of MRS in DLB has been recently reviewed by Watson et al. (2009), who concluded: In summary, some but not all studies found relatively normal NAACr ratios in DLB while in Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD), similar reductions to AD are seen. The differing voxels of interest, comparison groups and small sample size currently limit the generalizability of results. There may be localized changes in VaD which are different from those found in AD (Jones and Waldman, 2004), in particular preclinical CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoenceophlopathy) has been associated with lower NAACr values, particularly in the corona radiate, albeit in a relatively small study (Stromillo et al., 2009). Finally, a study of 61 patients with AIDS dementia complex (stages 1-3) and 39 HIV-positive neurologically asymptomatic individuals suggested that neuropsychological impairment is associated with reduced markers of mature neurons and increased markers of gliosis in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter (Paul et al., 2007).\nIn summary, while the need is clearly recognized for clinical studies that confirm the usefulness of MRS in diagnosis and prediction or monitoring of treatment success, such studies are still lacking.",

    "Diffusion tensor imaging": {
      "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that is increasingly used to analyze white matter (WM) integrity in vivo. DTI measures the diffusion of water molecules in neural tissue and exploits the fact that, within WM, the parallel arrangement of myelinated WM fibers restricts diffusion perpendicular to the WM tract, resulting in anisotropic diffusion. Analysis of DTI data involves fitting a diffusion tensor model at each voxel of the DTI image, with the magnitude and direction of tissue water mobility measured in the x, y and z direction, and the diffusion tensor modeled as an ellipsoid. Diffusion along the major axis of the ellipsoid, λ 1 , is assumed to reflect diffusivity parallel to the WM tract and is termed axial diffusivity. The two minor axes, λ 2 and λ 3 , can be averaged to compute radial diffusivity, representing diffusion perpendicular to the WM tract. Mean diffusivity (MD) is the average of diffusivity in all three directions and provides a measure of the overall diffusion of molecules. Finally, fractional anisotropy (FA), a ratio of axial to radial diffusivity, provides a measure of the shape of the diffusion ellipsoid. Such DTI metrics can be extracted locally in a priori defined regions using region of interest (ROI) analysis or tractography, or globally using voxel-based analysis (VBA) or tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).\nResults of post-mortem and MRI studies have supported a key role for WM abnormalities in the pathophysiology of AD. Specifically, WM degradation has been hypothesized to result from myelin breakdown in line with the retrogenesis hypothesis (Bartzokis, 2004), Wallerian degeneration occurring secondary to gray matter pathology, and also local microvascular changes.\nOverall, DTI studies of AD have detected decreased FA and increased MD values in AD compared with controls. In a recent metaanalysis that included 33 case-control ROI or tractography studies of AD, AD was found to be associated with reduced FA and elevated MD values compared with controls in widespread brain regions, including within frontal and temporal white matter, the posterior cingulum, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus (Sexton et al., 2010a). Furthermore, several studies have reported a significant association between decreased Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in AD and reduced FA (Bozzali et al., 2002;Duan et al., 2006;Ukmar et al., 2008;Mielke et al., 2009) or increased MD (Bozzali et al., 2002;Duan et al., 2006), indicating that DTI metrics may be sensitive markers of disease progression.\nIn contrast to the growing number of casecontrol studies of AD, few studies have used DTI to investigate changes brought about by other types of dementia, e.g. DLB, VaD and FTD. As with studies of AD, those of other dementias generally report reduced FA and elevated MD in patients compared with healthy controls. Importantly though, differences have also been detected between different types of dementias, indicating that DTI metrics may have potential as biomarkers used to distinguish different types of dementia.\nIn VaD, WM degradation appears mostly to affect the anterior parts of the corpus callosum (Zarei et al., 2009). Also, significantly lower FA and higher MD values have been detected in VaD patients compared with AD patients in the posterior periventricular area (Chen et al., 2009).\nIn DLB, reductions in FA and increases in MD compared with healthy controls have been reported in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Ota et al., 2009;Kantarci et al., 2010) and in frontal, occipital and parietal white matter (Bozzali et al., 2005). Differences between AD and DLB patients have been found in the posterior cingulum, with MD elevated in the AD group compared with both control and DLB groups (Kantarci et al., 2010). There are also several tracts that might be useful to differentiate DLB and PDD. Compared with PDD patients, FA in patients with DLB was significantly lower in bilateral posterior temporal, posterior cingulum and bilateral visual association fibers extending into occipital areas (Lee et al., 2010).\nIn FTD, the differences in FA between patients and healthy controls are mainly found in the anterior cingulate, uncinate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Whitwell et al., 2010). In comparison with AD, WM degradation is increased in FTD patients and found especially in frontal WM tracts, including the anterior cingulum, anterior corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus (Zhang et al., 2009).\nHowever, it is important to note that most of the studies of other dementias were limited to preselected ROI. This type of analysis is insensitive to changes in WM integrity outside of the ROI. Additionally, it is difficult to compare the changes brought about by the different type of dementias because, to date, studies have concentrated on one or two types of dementia only.\nAlterations in WM have also been found in people at higher risk of developing AD, including those with MCI and the ε4 allelic variant of the APOE gene. A meta-analysis of 21 case-control studies of MCI found that differences between MCI and controls paralleled the differences between AD and controls, but fewer regions reached statistical significance (Sexton et al., 2010a). As with AD, several studies have reported a significant association between decreased MMSE and reduced FA in MCI (Ukmar et al., 2008;Bai et al., 2009;Mielke et al., 2009;). Furthermore, hippocampal MD has been found to be superior to hippocampal volumes in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia (Fellgiebel et al., 2004). The ε4 allelic variant of the APOE gene is associated with higher risk of developing both early-and lateonset AD, and age-related cognitive impairment. Several studies have reported effects of the APOE ε4 allele on WM integrity in brain tracts, such as the parahippocampal WM (Honea et al., 2009) and the corpus callosum (Smith et al., 2010). Furthermore, a recent whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed reduced FA in widespread WM tracts of the brain (Figure 4). This effect is already present in young APOE ε4 carriers aged 20-35 years and remains relatively stable throughout adulthood (Heise et al., 2010).\nOverall, DTI has proved to be a sensitive technique to detect group differences between various dementias, at-risk groups and control groups. However, before translation to the clinic would be possible, further studies are needed in order to better characterize the anatomy of WM abnormalities, especially in dementias other than AD. This is complicated by the fact that a priori distinctions between different types of dementia (e.g. VaD and AD) are not always straightforward. Additionally, it is unclear if it is important to differentiate between disease severity or disease subtypes, e.g. of FTD. Furthermore, more standardized ways of acquiring and analyzing DTI data are required. Indeed, results of meta-analyses have indicated that both patient characteristics (MMSE, age, and percentage of women) and acquisition parameters (b value, voxel size, number of directions, number of excitations) contribute to the significant heterogeneity observed between studies (Sexton et al., 2010a). Also, it is not yet clear which DTI metric is the most sensitive measure of WM degradation in dementia. Although FA is the most commonly used DTI metric, it lacks sensitivity when diffusivity in all three directions displays similar changes. For example, MD has been found to be more sensitive than FA in detecting group differences between AD and control participants (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010), and in reflecting decline in MMSE (Nakata et al., 2009) and episodic memory (Sexton et al., 2010b).",

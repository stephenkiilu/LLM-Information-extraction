    "abstract": "Purpose To investigate microstructural alterations in white matter in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and to assess the potential diagnostic performance of NODDI-derived parameters. Methods In this study 14 MCI patients, 14 AD patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The diffusion tensor imaging(DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and NODDI-derived neurite density index (NDI), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and volume fraction of isotropic water molecules (Viso) were calculated from the diffusion data. The tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method was used for statistical analysis with one-way ANOVA. The correlations between the parameter values and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores were examined. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of different parameters. Results Compared with the HC group, the NDI and ODI values decreased significantly and the Viso values were significantly increased in the MCI and AD groups (p  0.01, threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)-corrected); however, there were no significant differences in FA values in the MCI group. The NDI, ODI, and Viso values of multiple fibers were significantly correlated with MMSE and MoCA scores. For the diagnosis of AD, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the NDI value of the splenium of corpus callosum was larger than the FA value (AUC  0.885, 0.714, p  0.042). The AUC of the Viso value of the right cerebral peduncle was larger than FA value (AUC  0.934, 0.531, p  0.004). Conclusion The NDI is more sensitive to white matter microstructural changes than FA and NODDI could be superior to DTI in the diagnosis of AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common type of dementia. Many researchers and clinicians hypothesize that the pathophysiology of AD can be explained by extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits that precipitate senile plaques and intracellular deposits of abnormal tau protein that precipitate neurofibrillary tangles 1; however, previous studies based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have shown that white matter damage is also present in the early stages of AD and thus may also represent the pathophysiology of AD 2,3. Furthermore, it is speculated that the beginnings of these white matter changes may also be present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which has an annual conversion rate to AD of 5-15, much greater than that of healthy elderly people 4; however, changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), a parameter derived from DTI, can reflect changes in the integrity of the myelin sheath, the density and diameter of the axons and fiber orientation or partial volume effects 5. Therefore, DTI lacks the specificity for characterizing the possible subtle white matter changes that may occur in patients with MCI before they convert to AD.\nNeurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) utilizes a multicompartment diffusion model based on the differences between water molecule diffusion in intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. It is a promising technique for distinguishing between three different specific microstructural tissue features: intraneurite diffusion, extraneurite diffusion, and the volume fraction within a voxel occupied by isotropic water diffusion 6. Based on three different compartments, NODDI generates three important parameters, namely neurite density index (NDI), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and the volume fraction of isotropic water molecules (Viso). The NDI represents the volume fraction of neurites in the intraneurite space, ODI evaluates the characteristics of neurite angular variation in the extraneurite space and reflects the changes of fiber orientations in the white matter and Viso represents the volume fraction of water molecules that can diffuse freely like CSF within the voxel 6,7. The parameters assessed by NODDI, including neurite density and fiber orientation dispersion, influence the FA value. Thus, NODDI may be able to more accurately evaluate microstructural alterations than FA. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the neurite density and orientation dispersion measured by NODDI have good agreement with results of histological measurements in mouse brain and patients with multiple sclerosis 8910. The purpose of this study was to investigate microstructural white matter alterations in patients with MCI and AD as detected by NODDI and whether NODDI-derived parameters have the potential to be used diagnostically for MCI and AD.",

The DTI parameter FA was calculated using DTIFIT tools in FSL. After extraction of non-brain tissue using Brain Extraction Tool (BET) in FSL, a brain mask was derived to define the regions of NODDI processing using the NODDI_toolbox (www.nitrc.orgprojectsnoddi_toolbox) in Matlab2012b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The WatsonSHStickTort-IsoV_B0 model was applied to calculate NODDI parameters (NDI, ODI, and Viso) 6.\nThe tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis was performed on all parameter maps for statistical analysis. All subjects images were nonlinearly registered to the FM-RIB58_FA template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space. All the aligned images were averaged, skeletonized and average skeleton maps were generated. Based on the parameter maps that were normalized to the MNI space, the DPABI (http:rfmri.orgdpabi) soft-ware package was used to extract the parameter values in each region of interest using the Johns Hopkins University (JHU)-WhiteMatter-labels as masks.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study evaluated the ability of NODDI to detect microstructural white matter changes in MCI and AD by com-K paring it with conventional DTI. Consistent with previous studies, the FA values of the bilateral cingulum, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, and left posterior limb of the internal capsule decreased significantly in the MCI group if the significance threshold were set at p  0.05 13,14; however, with the significance threshold set at p  0.01, the results showed that between the HC and MCI groups there were no significant differences in FA, but there were multiple significant differences in NDI and ODI values. Compared with the MCI group, there were more widespread significant differences in NDI than FA in the same slices of the occipital and parietal lobes in the AD group. As shown in Fig. 1a,b, the NDI values of the splenium of the corpus callosum and the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus decreased significantly in the MCI and AD groups, whereas the FA values were not significantly different within the same slices. Other studies have also shown that the splenium of the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus exhibit significant reduced FA values at the MCI stage 15,16. Some studies indicated that Aβ deposition is one of the AD-related pathological changes and caused cholinergic neurons and axons reduction in the white matter 17,18, resulting in the reduction of NDI. Overall, the results indicate that NDI values are more sensitive to the changes in white matter than FA which is consistent with a study by Slattery et al. 19. Furthermore, the regions with significant differences in NDI between MCI and AD groups showed a trend from the lower-middle part of the brain to the upper part of the brain. Thal et al. showed that neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) begin in the transentorhinal region and then spread upward and peripherally to the entorhinal region, the hippocampus and the neocortex 20,21. To some extent, the similarity in trends between the present studys NDI values and the spread of NFT may suggest that NDI values correlate with tau protein deposition and some studies have also revealed that NDI values have significant correlations with tau protein deposition 22. The ODI values were significantly lower mainly in the white matter of the frontal and occipital lobes of the MCI and AD groups compared to the control group. This de-K Fig. 2 The correlation analyses with the maximal correlation coefficients between NODDI-derived parameters (NDI, ODI, Viso) and neuropsychological testing scores (left column MMSE scores, right column MoCA scores). NODDI neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, FA fractional anisotropy, NDI neurite density index, ODI orientation dispersion index, Viso volume fraction of isotropic water molecules, MMSE mini-mental state examination, MoCA Montreal cognitive assessment crease may be due to that the selectivity of degenerative disorders, which mainly lead to the loss of axons in the secondary fibers in the crossing fibers and leaving more aligned axons in the primary tracts 19.\nThe Viso values increased in the MCI and AD groups specifically in the brain stem and in the bilateral medial temporal lobes. The increased Viso values were more widespread in the AD group than in the MCI group. Several studies have shown that increased Viso values indicate the degree of atrophy by reflecting cell shrinkage and decreased tissue volume fraction 22,23. Therefore, the current study suggests white matter atrophy of medial temporal lobe in MCI and AD, which is consistent with many previous studies that have demonstrated white matter atrophy of medial temporal lobe in the early stage of AD most likely secondary to tau protein deposition 24252627. The fact that Viso values were already able to detect changes in the MCI group suggest that Viso could be used to monitor progression throughout MCI and AD.\nRegarding correlations between NODDI parameters and neuropsychological scores, the NDI values in the splenium of the corpus callosum showed the strongest correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores, which is similar to the result of Wang et al. 15. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that NDI values may reflect changes in the number of synapses, which has been shown to correlate with MMSE scores 28,29. Additionally, the ODI and Viso values of multiple fibers were significantly correlated with the MMSE and MoCA scores; however, no FA values were correlated with the MMSE and MoCA scores. Furthermore, the AUC of the NDI value of the splenium of corpus callosum and the Viso value of the right cerebral peduncle were significantly larger than the corresponding FA values. These results indicate that NODDI may better Fig. 3 For the diagnosis of MCI, ROC curve analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic performance of parameters in brain structures with the strongest correlation (top row).",

First, the study did not include positron emission tomography (PET) examinations or pathological verification confirming tau protein deposition in the AD and MCI participants involved in this study. Second, the MCI and AD groups were not divided into different subtypes, which relate to different structural damage, degeneration in different regions, and different areas of cognitive impairment. Third, the relatively small sample size limits the accuracy of the results; however, in order to ensure the accuracy of the results, strict inspection of image quality was performed before data processing. Future studies will include CSF biochemical indices and PET examinations, larger samples, and more precise participant subgroups reflecting AD severity.\nIn conclusion, NDI may be much more sensitive to microstructural white matter alterations in MCI and AD patients. The loss of axons, dendrites and white matter atrophy may be characterized by NODDI in the MCI stage and NODDI could also effectively predict clinical cognitive status and may be superior to DTI in the diagnosis of AD. In brief, NODDI may be a preferable approach for the study of MCI and AD.",

    "abstract": "Objective: White matter atrophy occurs independently of lesions in multiple sclerosis. In contrast to lesion detection, the quantitative assessment of white matter atrophy in individual patients has been regarded as a major challenge. We therefore tested the hypothesis that white matter atrophy (WMA) is present at the very beginning of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in virtually each individual patient. To find a new sensitive and robust marker for WMA we investigated the relationship between cortical surface area, white matter volume (WMV), and whole-brainsurface-averaged rectified cortical extrinsic curvature. Based on geometrical considerations we hypothesized that cortical curvature increases if WMV decreases and the cortical surface area remains constant. Methods: In total, 95 participants were enrolled: 30 patients with early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS; 30 age-matched control subjects; 30 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 5 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Results: 2930 MS and 55 CIS patients showed lower WMV than expected from their intracranial volume (average reduction 13.0, P b 10 -10 ), while the cortical surface area showed no significant differences compared with controls. The estimated WMV reductions were correlated with an increase in cortical curvature (R  0.62, P  0.000001). Discriminant analysis revealed that the curvature increase was highly specific for the MS and CIS groups (96.7 correct assignments between MS and control groups) and was significantly correlated with reduction of white matter fractional anisotropy, as determined by diffusion tensor imaging and the Expanded Disability Status Scale. As expected by the predominant gray and WM degeneration in AD, no systematic curvature increase was observed in AD. Conclusion: Whole-brain-averaged cortical extrinsic curvature appears to be a specific and quantitative marker for a WMV-cortex disproportionality and allows us to assess pure WMA without being confounded by intracranial volume. WMA seems to be a characteristic symptom in early MS and can already occur in patients with CIS and should thus be considered in future MS research and clinical studies.",

      "text": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, multifocal, demyelinating disorder of the CNS with progressive neurodegeneration caused by autoimmuneinflammatory components. MRI characteristics of the disease include multifocal white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) lesions, brain atrophy, pseudoatrophy, and occult changes in normal-appearing WM and GM (Pirko et al., 2007;Zivadinov, 2007;Zivadinov et al., 2008), highlighting the pathological significance of measures beyond lesion number and volume (Miller et al., 2002). Visualizing and measuring tissue loss in the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis presents challenges, as it is inevitably easier to capture an image of conspicuous matter, such as in tumor identification, than it is to capture the absence NeuroImage: Clinical 6 (2014) 475476477478479480481482483484485486487 Abbreviations: 3D, three-dimensional; CI, confidence interval; CIS, clinically isolated syndrome; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; EDSS, Expanded Disability Status Scale; EVAL, Münster Neuroimaging Evaluation System; eWMV, estimated white matter volume; FA, fractional anisotropy; FOV, field of view; GM, gray matter; GMV, gray matter volume; GRAPPA, generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition; ICV, intracranial volume; ROI, region of interest; SD, standard deviation; TE, echo time; TR, repetition time; TSE, turbo spin-echo; WM, white matter; WMV, white matter volume; ΔWMV, WMV -eWMV.\nof matter due to the disappearance of myelin sheaths, axonal loss, or cell death.\nReduction in brain volume can occur by distinct mechanisms, including inflammatory processes, such as brain oedema, and neurodegenerative events, such as the loss of myelin or axons. There is a vast amount of evidence supporting the hypothesis that pathological changes in WM volume (WMV) may occur by mechanisms that are at least partly independent of overt lesion genesis in early multiple sclerosis (Chard et al., 2002;Filippi et al., 2012). The loss of WM, specifically, is considered to be of high pathophysiological relevance and not an epiphenomenon. Brain atrophy, which can be detected very early in the disease course of multiple sclerosis, is strongly related to disability, but is not well reflected by lesion load when examined in larger cohorts (Calabrese et al., 2007;De et al., 2010;Popescu et al., 2013;Turner et al., 2003).",

    "Overall hypothesis": {
      "text": "With the evolution of more sophisticated imaging techniques, the opportunity exists to identify new, increasingly sensitive measures of tissue loss. Such a novel tissue loss-sensitive biomarker would need to avoid any confounding effects of intracranial volume (ICV), absolute brain size, or absolute CSF volume, and would have to reflect actual microstructural changes of the WM as well as functional deficits of the patients. One concept for such a new marker was inspired by an everyday life observation (Fig. 1): that an object with signs of minimal volumetric atrophy would have an increased extrinsic (mean) surface curvature if the surface area remains largely constant while the volume is reduced. Thus, it was hypothesized that measuring the extrinsic curvature of the cortex may provide a reliable measure of underlying WM atrophy.",

    "Why measuring curvature to assess a volume?": {
      "text": "The idea here was not to assess any absolute or relative volume. The idea was to assess a potential volumetric change of the WM with a single time point MRI. An initial (single time point) WMV estimation can principally not be used to ensure (slight) atrophy. By definition, atrophy is an acquired volume loss, but an initially estimated WMV is not related to any earlier volume. Thus we questioned if we could find a measure that must have changed from a normal value to an obviously (quantitatively) altered value if the WM selectively has shrunk in the past? As a potential candidate, we identified the cortical curvature. However, if the analogy to the apple of Fig. 1 should hold, a number of prerequisites must be fulfilled. We have to show that: (i) the WM volume is lower in patients with MS, (ii) the cortical surface area is not proportionally altered relative to healthy controls, (iii) the cortical curvature of healthy subjects has less variation than the WMV, and (iv) a volume lower than expected from normal controls is correlated with a higher curvature.",

      "text": "To test the prerequisites to establish increased cortical curvature as marker for a volumetric change (Section 1.3, i-iv) and to test our clinical hypotheses, we performed a study that was structured into the following analyses.\nIn Analysis I, we estimated WMV and GM volume (GMV) in a cohort of patients with early and advanced relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (the multiple sclerosis group), age-matched control subjects (the control group) and patients with expected high atrophy of the WM and GM due to their age and a neurodegenerative condition (the Alzheimers disease group). We were interested in how the expected WM atrophy of the relatively young patients with multiple sclerosis was quantitatively related to the atrophy observed in the Alzheimers disease group. We further questioned how the absolute WMVs were related to (and thus confounded by) the individual ICVs. To test the hypothesis that effects seen in the multiple sclerosis group could principally also occur in individuals who are potentially in a pre-state of multiple sclerosis, we also included five patients with CIS (Part I-a). In Part I-b of the study, we examined individual cortical GM measures, i.e. the cortical GMV, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area of all participants.\nAnalysis II aimed to answer the question whether a potential WM-GM disproportion would correlate with an increased cortical extrinsic curvature as demonstrated by the apple in Fig. 1 (Part II-a), and, if so, if this increase would be specific to the patients in the multiple sclerosis group (Part II-b), and how age, disease duration, and lesion load would be related to any potential curvature alteration (Part II-c). Analysis III should reveal if any potential geometric properties of the cortex are associated with intrinsic microstructural alterations of the WM as they can be determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nAnalysis IV should clarify if an increase in the cortical extrinsic curvature has any functional correlate, i.e. is related to the disease progression as expressed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (Part IV-a), and, if so, whether this measure would better correlate with the EDSS than the estimated individual volumetric loss of WM brain parenchyma (denoted in the following as ΔWMV) or the individual WM lesion load (Part IV-b).",

The registration algorithm provided rigorous iterative multi-contrast registration steps based on FA contrasts and b0 contrasts (b  0 smm 2 ), so that volumetric effects in the resulting normalized FA maps were negligible (Mohammadi et al., 2012). All registered diffusivity images corresponded to the MNI (Montreal Neurologic Institute) coordinate space. For quantitative analysis of the optimally spatially registered images, we generated two regions of interest (ROI): one for the whole WM and the other for the corpus callosum. These ROIs that were automatically created on the output images had been employed and validated in earlier studies (Deppe et al., 2007;Kleffner et al., 2008;Wersching et al., 2010). All DTI image-processing steps (registration, eddy current correction, tensor estimation, diffusion parameter, and ROI calculation) were performed in a fully automated (and thus objective) processing pipeline for quantitative assessment of DTI data (Münster Neuroimaging Evaluation System EVAL) (Deppe et al., 2007(Deppe et al., , 2008(Deppe et al., , 2013)).",

For details of this method see Dale et al. (1999), Fischl (2012), Fischl and Dale (2000) and Fischl et al. (1999). Briefly, cerebral WM was initially segmented, divided into two hemispheres, and the brainstem and cerebellum were removed. A triangle-based mesh of the WM surface is produced through tessellation, which is subsequently deformed outward to generate the pial surface before automatic correction of topological defects in the resulting main fold. Cortical thickness mean and Gaussian intrinsic curvature measurements were obtained at each vertex by reconstructing representations of the GM-WM boundary and the pial surface. The entire cortex of each patient and control was visually inspected, but no relevant errors in cortical labeling could be detected that had to be manually corrected. Thus the whole quantitative brain analysis was completely objective and could not be biased by any subjective factor. Local cortical thickness, rectified extrinsic and Gaussian curvature had been averaged over both cerebral hemispheres using software tools incorporated into FreeSurfer software for each examined individual. Additionally, we calculated the individual total cortical surface area. From the segmented data, we used the cortical WMV and the cortex volume as calculated by FreeSurfer. By summarizing the volumes of WM hypointensities as detected by FreeSurfer in the 3D T1w images we assessed the individual WM lesion load.",

Most notably, an increased cortical curvature was even shown in patients with CIS, a potentially early sign of multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that the curvature increase was most likely caused by WM atrophy in each individual subject (Figs. 3,6, and 10) and arose due to an imbalance of cortex surface area and WMV. A mean WMV reduction of 13.0 was seen in the multiple sclerosis group, with 2930 patients showing a negative ΔWMV; in contrast, there were no relevant differences seen in cortical volume or surface area between the patients with multiple sclerosis and the control group (Figs. 4 and5).\nThe increased cortical extrinsic curvature in the multiple sclerosis group is not an abstract mathematical expression from differential geometry, but can actually be seen in MRI slices when compared with subjects with an average curvature (Fig. 8A,B). The WM shrinkage is also visible, if 3D reconstructed WM surfaces are compared (Fig. 9) (see also Voets et al., 2011). An increased cortical extrinsic curvature seems to be specific to primary WMV loss and a nearly (but not fully) intact cerebral cortex. In patients with neurodegenerative Alzheimers disease, it can be assumed that because of the disease and the age of these patients, the cortex and WM were degenerated. There was no systematic disproportion of WMV and cortical GM surface, and, thus, no systematic change in the cortical curvature (Fig. 7). This finding further supports the hypothesis that the WM-GM disproportion is causative of the increased extrinsic curvature.",

The WM surface of the multiple sclerosis patient (E) looked obviously shrunken with sharper edges at the outer gyri when compared with the WM surface of the control subject (B) with normal WMV. negative value makes immediately clear that the volume is XY mm 3 below the normal average. The calculation of an expectation value for normal WMV was possible due to the strong linear relation between ICV and WMV in healthy controls (Fig. 3). However, it should be noted here, that a negative ΔWMV does not automatically mean that the WM is atrophic. Fifty percent of the healthy subjects have per definition a negative ΔWMV.",

    "Volume loss and microstructure": {
      "text": "To investigate how increased extrinsic curvature is related to potential microstructural alterations of the WM, we employed DTI to assess microstructural tissue damage in normal-appearing WM (Deppe et al., 2008;Duning et al., 2010;Keller et al., 2013). For this purpose, we calculated the FA within a ROI outlining the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was selected for the following three reasons. Firstly, axonal damage in conjunction with WM atrophy in the normal-appearing WM of the corpus callosum in postmortem brains of patients with multiple sclerosis was already demonstrated by using quantitative measures of both axonal density and WM atrophy (Evangelou et al., 2000). Secondly, the corpus callosum contains virtually no crossing fibers, so that this ROI seemed particularly qualified to quantify neuronal integrity loss by FA derived from a second-order tensor model (Deppe et al., 2007). Thirdly, a recent study (Mohammadi et al., 2012), showed that volumetric or atrophic effects on the registered diffusion-weighted images are negligible in the corpus callosum if our newly developed rigorous spatial normalization is employed for quantitative FA comparisons. As expected, the FA in the corpus callosum was significantly reduced in the multiple sclerosis group, which can be interpreted as a kind of physical microstructural thinning-out effect that leads to a loss of diffusion barriers within the WM. Moreover, within the multiple sclerosis group, the individual FA reduction was significantly correlated with the individual increase in extrinsic curvature; thus, pointing to an association between individual WMV reduction and microstructural WM damage (Fig. 11). These findings of early FA and volume reduction in the corpus callosum are congruent with previous studies showing early degeneration of the corpus callosum over 1 year following the first acute inflammatory episode in patients with multiple sclerosis (Audoin et al., 2007;Ranjeva et al., 2003). A second ROI, encompassing the whole WM, showed very similar effects to those seen in the corpus callosum ROI; therefore, it seems likely that findings in the corpus callosum are representative of the whole WM (Fig. 12).",

    "Cortical thickness": {
      "text": "A low, but significant reduction in cortical thickness was seen in the multiple sclerosis versus the control group (3.6). This seems relatively small compared with other studies (Calabrese et al., 2007(Calabrese et al., , 2013)), but may be explained by the low degree of patient disability in the study presented here. In a histological study, relative neocortical thinning of 10 was reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (Wegner et al., 2006). In contrast to the findings of Sailer et al. (2003), a significant relationship between EDSS and cortical thickness was not established in this study, which may be due to the lack of effect on the cortical GM. However, one patient in our multiple sclerosis group (described as an outlier in Fig. 11) differed significantly from the other patients due to their significantly low GMV. Interestingly, the curvature of this patient was less increased than other multiple sclerosis patients, as would be expected when the WM and GM are both atrophic and, therefore, virtually no GM-WM disproportion exists.",

    "Reliability of cortical curvature estimates": {
      "text": "The reliability of the FreeSurfer program for cortical reconstruction, GMV and WMV, and cerebral surface measurements has been assessed previously in a number of studies (Han et al., 2006;Kang et al., 2012b;Keller et al., 2012;Lee et al., 2006;Rosas et al., 2002) and cortical curvature analysis has also been performed on different neurological or psychiatric patients (Ronan et al., 2011b(Ronan et al., , 2012;;Voets et al., 2011). The inter-individual variability of 3.92 (CV) in whole-brain-averaged absolute extrinsic curvature (see Table 2) was considerably smaller than the variability of the absolute WMV in our control group (13.03; see Table 1). The low variability in the cortical extrinsic curvature of less than 4 is remarkable, because no normalization to ICV, age, or gender was employed. The cortical extrinsic curvature, therefore, seems to represent a robust and sensitive biomarker for the detection of changes in the GM-WM proportion. A previous study in healthy controls showed mean values of 0.138 mm -1 for the whole-brain-averaged cortical curvature and 2.585 mm for average cortical thickness (Kang et al., 2012a), which seem to differ from the values reported in this paper. However, if we assume that both scanners differed in linear length calibration by a factor f  2.59 mm2.50 mm, their average extrinsic curvature would result in f  0.138 mm -1  0.143 mm -1 and would thus fit well into the 95 CI of the whole-brain-averaged absolute extrinsic curvature of healthy persons seen in this study. This observation may suggest that even small differences in geometric size calibrations may be important when comparing quantitative results between different scanners or system configurations (see also Han et al., 2006). In Fig. 10, there seems to be a slight age dependent trend of a decreasing curvature in the control group. This could have occurred by chance (not significant), but would also fit with the finding that the WMV is less affected in healthy aging than the GMV (Grossman et al., 2002;Vernooij et al., 2008).",

    "Consideration of intrinsic curvature": {
      "text": "Two types of cortical curvature may be examined in patients with multiple sclerosis. The first type, the extrinsic curvature or mean curvature, is a curvature that arises from the mechanical folding of the surface, and, as such, is not a property of the surface itself, but rather of how it is embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) space. Extrinsic curvature changes, if a bendable, but non-elastic two-dimensional surface is folded within a 3D space. For example, if we roll up a flat piece of paper into a cylinder, the extrinsic curvature c changes, but not the second type, the Gaussian (or intrinsic) curvature. In a bendable, but non-elastic, and non-stretchable surface, we cannot change the intrinsic curvature without destroying the surface. For example, it is not possible to fit a piece of paper (Gaussian curvature  0.0 mm -2 ) to the surface of a sphere (Gaussian curvature  1  R 2 ) without producing folds and tears (Ronan et al., 2011a).\nIn the present study, we concentrated on the extrinsic or mean curvature. FreeSurfer software also measures Gaussian (or intrinsic) curvature of the cortex. The intrinsic curvatures of the patients cortices were also significantly affected by the atrophy, but showed higher intra-group variability, were less significantly reduced (t  4.18, P  0.0001), and were not so specific than the extrinsic curvatures. Thus, the results about the intrinsic curvature were not reported in detail here.",

    "Functional relevance of cortical extrinsic curvature increase": {
      "text": "Individual disability as expressed by the EDSS was better explained by the extrinsic curvature increase of a patient than by the estimated individual volumetric loss of WM brain parenchyma (ΔWMV) or the WM lesion load (Part IV-b). The weak correlation between EDSS and lesion load might be explained by the fact that the (scalar) measure lesion load is per se a rather insensitive index because it does not account for the varying functional relevance of different lesion sites. However, it seems to be interesting for further studies to compare how T2wFLAIR lesions would be correlated to cortical curvature alterations.",

    "Methodological limitations and future research directions": {
      "text": "The results presented here are based only on one single observation per patient, and more assessments over time would be required to define cortical curvature as a longitudinal biomarker of WM atrophy. Furthermore, this study did not examine the prognostic value of the cortical extrinsic curvature for disease progression. The pre-diagnostic levels of WM in these patients are unknown; thus, the degree of atrophy over time and with increasing severity of illness cannot be elucidated. The use of the EDSS as an indicator of disease progression has known limitations due to subjective error and inter-rater variability (Reilmann et al., 2013). Our group of patients with Alzheimers disease was not age-matched to our control group, as this group served only as a reference for patients with pronounced WM and GM alterations.\nThis study did not account for the presence of cortical lesions, which potentially could affect the cortex segmentation and reconstruction and could, therefore, also affect local estimates of cortical curvature. However, inspection of the T2-weighted and FLAIR images revealed that relevant lesion load could not be observed in our multiple sclerosis group, thus, the cortical GM was likely intact in these patients. In context with the finding that nearly every patient showed an increased curvature, it is very unlikely, that the increase is relevantly driven by lesions. This hypothesis would be further supported by the fact that the multiple sclerosis patients had only a small reduction in cortical thickness and a cortical GMV in the range of the control group, with the exception of one patient.\nThis study did not explore any relationship between the curvature alterations and lesion load in multiple sclerosis patients. This might form the basis of future investigations in larger sample groups to explore the effects of specific lesion patterns, like those demonstrated in the study by Giorgio et al., which showed regionally different effects on cortex geometry (Giorgio et al., 2013). It would also be of interest to study WM-GM disproportionality with further quantitative MRI measures, such as myelin water fraction (Kitzler et al., 2012), MRI spectroscopy measures, and histopathology, in order to investigate which predominant factor drives the WM-GM disproportionality and thus the WMV loss. From a translational point of view, it would be also interesting whether cortical curvature correlates better with higher cognitive functions than conventional structural marker like lesion load or volumetric atrophy marker.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "The present findings provide further evidence that WM atrophy is already present at the very beginning of multiple sclerosis and in every patient suffering with this illness. The increased cortical extrinsic curvature could be used to classify 2930 patients to the multiple sclerosis group, thus providing a sensitive indicator of WM loss. Overall, the average WM atrophy that we estimated in these 30 patients was 13, which would be difficult to visualize with conventional MRI methods (2D slices, thickness N 2 mm). However, the specific curvature increase, used as a surrogate measure of WM-GM disproportionality and correlating with FA and EDSS, suggested that WM reduction in this population with multiple sclerosis might be involved in the pathological disease processes that occur independently of GM degeneration. Thus, WM-GM disproportionality and the cortical curvature measurement should be considered as a potential monitoring tool in this devastating, degenerative disorder, and this warrants further assessment in future multiple sclerosis research.",

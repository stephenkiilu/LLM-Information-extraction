      "text": "The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is transitional stage between healthy ageing and very mild Alzheimers disease (AD). The main symptom of MCI is memory impairments that are out of proportion to that expected for their age. The conversion rate of MCI to AD dementia is 10-15 per year 1,2. The preliminary diagnosis of prodromal AD includes neurological examination, mental status test and brain imaging 3. The researches are ongoing to find specific biomarkers which may provide conclusive diagnosis of early AD. The challenges in development of biomarker for early detection of AD is its long asymptomatic prodromal stages, variability in clinical features, genetic polymorphism and molecular etiologies (e.g.) presenilin-1 (PS-1), presenilin-2 (PS-2) and APP mutation, apolipoprotein E (APOE) and sporadic AD 4. The blood is most non-invasive, less expensive and time saving source of biomarker entity, but due to selective nature of blood brain barrier, the brain protein do not exudates although diluted and over masked by highly abundant proteins present in blood 4.\nCurrently, amyloid beta protein, tau protein and phosphor-tau expression level are analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and act as valuable source of biomarkers, being in direct contact with brain and spinal cord it provides a complete representation of various biochemical and metabolic profile of brain, however, the invasive procedure of CSF isolation and irreproducible results, has limited these biomarkers to be used in diagnosis of early AD 5,6. Neuroimaging is used as prospective area for enhancement of early detection of cognitive impairment before the progression to clinical AD 789. The microscopic changes in white matter of AD was reported by Brun and Englund, these author reported that there was change in myelin sheath, axon and oligodendroglial cell with mild glial reactions 10. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has provided significant evidences that white matter integrity is altered in cognitive normal individuals at high risk of AD and decreased significantly in AD 11,12. The report of DTI imaging in normal individual at high risk of AD have shown white matter changes in parahippocampal white matter, caudal portion of cingulum, fornix and posterior portion of corpus callosum 131415. Studies have shown that DTI can contribute in identification of white matter changes in age related cognitive decline 11,16. Although, blood samples are easy to obtain and exploration of biomarker in serumplasma become essentially significant. The recent study conduced by Blasko and coworkers revealed that Aβ-42 level were high in MCI and drops as cognitive function of patient decline in AD 17. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to find change in plasma protein profile of MCI and changes in white matter integrity as compared with age match healthy control to find early marker for detection of prodromal stage of Alzheimers dementia.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The MCI subjects reported in our studies have shown significant decline in cognitive function as evaluated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) neuropsychological test. The decrease in FA value in right and left frontal lobe, fornix, forcep major, corpus callosum and increase in ADC value of right temporal lobe, hippocampus head, corpus callosum and forcep major decreases neuropsychological function such as orientation, immediate recall, attention, 3-step command, delayed recall, naming, reading and comprehension, copy design in MCI subjects as compared with control. The expression of keratin type 2 protein was negative correlated with MMSE score in our study, which depicts lower MMSE score and higher expression of keratin type 2 in MCI subjects. Further, ADC and FA values was strongly correlated with the expression of keratin type 2 in MCI subjects, which implicate that white matter changes and increase in keratin type 2 expression are involved in neurodegeneration. The changes in cognitive functions in MCI subject in our study is in agreement with previous study of Stricker and coworker, in which they depicted that decrease in white matter integrity, was related to cognition and is independent of cortical thinning 23. The identification of keratin type 2 and albumin precursor protein in our study implicates its role in AD pathology, although reports are available in which keratin 9 and albumin were important component of biomarker panel for diagnosing AD 24. The proteomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica patient found that expression of keratin was two fold higher as compared with control 25. Recent, studies by Lie and coworker identified keratin as one of the potential molecule involved in AD pathology but its action of mechanism is still unknown 26. The increase in expression of keratin type 2 in MCI subject in our study indicates that white matter degeneration due to ageing result in myelin sheath to disintegrate which mainly composed of proteolipid having keratin as major constituent, these keratin might exudates from blood brain barrier into the peripheral system. The higher concentration of proteolipid in white matter as compared with grey matter is already reported 27. To ascertain that increase keratin type 2 level in plasma might not be due to entry of keratinocytes through punctured skin in blood plasma, we also checked the level of keratin type 2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MCI subjects and subject having dementia with lewy bodies (DLB), the concentration of keratin type 2 was significantly higher as compared with control and DLB. Further, Keratin 9 was found linked to Wnt-signaling cascade via interaction with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Cadherin 1 (CDH1), which might be involved in signaling of keratinocytes development 28. The dysfunction of blood brain barrier (BBB) has been implicated in AD, and its maintenance through tight junction protein is regulated by Wnt-signaling pathway 28. The activation of Dickkopf (DKK1), which is wntpathway antagonist, induces keratin expression in epidermis, furthermore its expression was found higher in brain of AD patient 29,30. The neurodegeneration in MCI subject as evident from white matter changes, in our study strongly correlates with increase in DKK1 expression which might induce the Keratin level in plasma through BBB dysfunction. Although, the expression of DKK1 need to be validated in MCI subject, but due to non-availability of tissue sample it could not be done. The expression of albumin was significantly lower in MCI subject as compared with control. The decrease in albumin level in our study is in agreement with previous case control studies, which linked low level of albumin with cognitive impairment 31,32. The role of inflammatory mediators and free radical in pathogenesis of MCI and dementia is widely accepted 33. The free radical generation in MCI subjects causes cell death, by damaging lipids, DNA, protein and carbohydrates, while the reaction between neurotransmitter and free radical form neurotoxin leads to neurodegeneration 34. The albumin act as plasma oxygen trapping and antioxidant defense for both endogenous and exogenous free radicals 35,36. The plasma albumin play vital role in conjugation with drugs, hormones and free fatty acid, the lower level of albumin might lead to neurotoxicty which results in mild cognitive impairment. Albumin also inhibits the formation of amyloid beta-peptide fibrils 37. The lower level of albumin in plasma and CSF might induce Alzheimers type pathology as reported earlier 38. The data from current study indicate that white matter changes and up regulation of Keratin and down regulation of albumin in plasma of MCI subjects might provide initial signatures for identification of MCI at prodromal stage.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed case-control studies of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with Alzheimers dementia (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in order to establish the relative severity and location of white matter microstructural changes. EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched using the keywords, (diffusion tensor and Alzheimer or mild cognitive impairment), as were reference lists of relevant papers. Forty-one diffusion tensor imaging studies contained data that were suitable for inclusion. Group means and standard deviations for fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, or p values from 2-sample tests, were extracted and pooled, using standard methods of meta-analysis and metaregression. Fractional anisotropy was decreased in AD in all regions except parietal white matter and internal capsule, while patients with MCI had lower values in all white matter regions except parietally and occipitally. Mean diffusivity was increased in AD in all regions, and in MCI in all but occipital and frontal regions.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and currently affects over 4.5 million people in the USA alone; this figure is set to rise to 13.2 million by 2050 (Hebert et al., 2003). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a descriptive category that identifies patients referred with memory impairment beyond that expected for age and education, who do not qualify for a diagnosis of dementia (Petersen, 2004).\nA recent meta-analysis calculated the annual conversion rate from MCI to AD at 5-10 (Mitchell et al., 2009), although some studies report rates of up to 41 (Geslani et al., 2005). As a result, there is great interest in improving our understanding of the underlying neuropathology of AD and MCI which, in time, may stimulate new avenues for treatment and novel means to evaluate them. Furthermore, new methods to aid in the early diagnosis of AD and MCI may even provide opportunities for preventative therapies.\nPathologically, AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles prominently located in medial-temporal lobe and anterior and posterior cingulate regions. However, both postmortem studies (Brun and Englund, 1986;Englund, 1998) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (Bartzokis et al., 2003;Brickman et al., 2009;Fazekas et al., 1987) have provided evidence of white matter (WM) abnormalities in AD. Moreover, significant correlations between WM measures and disease severity have been reported (Fjell et al., 2009;Heo et al., 2009), which suggests that WM measures may be used as indexes of disease progression. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive MRI technique that can study the orientation and integrity of WM tracts by measuring the diffusion of water molecules in neural tissue (Le Bihan, 2003). To date, the majority of studies of AD and MCI have used DTI to estimate the degree of anisotropy (fractional anisotropy, FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules locally in a priori defined regions of interest (ROI) using manual tracing, masking, or tractography methods.\nOverall, DTI studies to date have detected lower FA and higher MD values in AD and MCI groups compared with controls. However, there is great heterogeneity in the anatomy of the regions studied, and although there have been several descriptive reviews of DTI studies of AD and MCI (Bozzali and Cherubini, 2007;Chua et al., 2008;Medina and Gaviria, 2008) no review has to our knowledge included a quantitative analysis. The present work aims to conduct a meta-analysis of studies that use ROI or tractography analysis to compare AD or MCI with a control group. The relationship between WM integrity and symptom severity will also be explored, as well as the effect of potential confounder variables, including patient characteristics and acquisition parameters.",

      "text": "First, titles and abstracts were screened for journal articles published in English that used DTI to analyze group differences between participants with either Alzheimers disease or MCI and healthy control participants, acquired with a minimum of 6 diffusion encoding directions to ensure sufficient reliability. Postmortem studies were excluded at this stage. Second, full-text articles were retrieved and screened for studies that used manual tracing, masking, or tractography to study a priori-defined ROI. Studies that assessed FA or MD globally, for example using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), were excluded from the meta-analysis. Such studies would add a considerable source of bias to our analysis as they typically only provide details of areas that are significantly different between groups, and are better examined separately using coordinate-based or image-based meta-analysis methods (Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2009). In order to eliminate repeat publication of data, we included the study with the more complete description of the data, where 2 contemporaneously published studies had the same first author and data acquisition methods, and similar patient characteristics, data analysis, and results.\nPatient subgroups of vascular MCI or AD were excluded from the meta-analysis. Where several data acquisition methods were used (Firbank et al., 2007), the more sensitive measure as stated by the authors was included, and where multiple scans per participant were acquired (Mielke et al., 2009), the first scan was used. AD subgroups of varying severity (Ding et al., 2008;Parente et al., 2008) and MCI subgroups of amnestic MCI and nonamnestic MCI (Chua et al., 2009) were entered as if they were separate studies with the number of subjects in the control group (degrees of freedom) divided by the number of patient subgroups, as in previous meta-analyses (Kempton et al., 2008).",

Regions that were reported by a minimum of 3 studies were included in the meta-analysis, a threshold employed by previous meta-analyses (Kempton et al., 2008). Studies that reported FA or MD values as means and standard deviations, and those that did not report means and standard deviations, but did present p values obtained from 2-sample tests, were entered into the meta-analysis. A conservative estimate of p ϭ 0.049 was assumed if p Ͻ 0.05 was stated. To obtain the most complete dataset possible, authors were contacted and asked to provide means and standard deviations where only p values were provided, or where values were not stated for all regions studied.",

Effect size was measured using Hedges g to correct for small sample size (Hedges and Olkin, 1985). A randomeffects model was used to calculate the pooled mean effect size, as we wished to make an unconditional inference beyond the included studies (Hedges and Vevea, 1998). In studies that used multiple ROIs in a single region, the average effect size was calculated. In order to maximize the number of studies included in the meta-analysis, effect size was averaged across the left and right hemispheres. Effect sizes between 0.2 and 0.5 were classified as small, between 0.5 and 0.8 as medium, and over 0.8 as large.\nIn regions where at least 4 studies presented lateralized values, a separate analysis of left and right values was also performed. Effect size differences between left and right ROI was determined with a mixed effects analysis.\nHeterogeneity was assessed using Cochranes Q and publication bias was considered using Begg and Mazumdar rank correlations (Begg and Mazumdar, 1994) and Eggers regression intercept test (Egger et al., 1997). Finally, the influence of the patient groups characteristics (age, percent-age of females, Mini Mental State Examination MMSE scores) and data acquisition parameters (field strength, b value, voxel size, number of directions, number of excitations NEX) was analyzed using fixed effect regression with Hedges g.",

In order to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, fixed effect regression was performed using patient characteristics (age, percentage of females, MMSE) and acquisition details (field strength, b values, acquisition voxel size, number of diffusion-encoding gradient directions, and number of excitations).\nIn 13 of 15 pooled effect sizes with greater than chance variability, at least 1 potential confounder variable was significantly correlated with effect sizes. With the exception of the regressions between age and MMSE of the MCI group and occipital effect size, greater absolute effect sizes were associated with lower mean MMSE (illness more severe), younger age, and a greater percentage of females. With the exception of the regression between the number of directions and MCI posterior cingulum effect size, greater absolute effect sizes were associated with greater numbers of directions, greater b values, smaller voxel sizes, and greater field strengths. However, in 8 of the 9 significant regression analyses with NEX, smaller absolute effect sizes were paradoxically associated with increased NEX. NEX is 2322.e7 C.E. Sexton et al.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "DTI is a sensitive technique that reveals group differences for AD, but also for patients with MCI, who by definition do not yet evidence any impairment of everyday function. AD was associated with reduced anisotropy and increased diffusivity compared with controls, in widespread brain regions, most notably in frontal and temporal lobes, and the posterior cingulum, corpus callosum, SLF, and UF (Fig. 2a). Differences between MCI and controls paralleled the differences between AD and controls, but fewer regions reached statistical significance (Fig. 2b). Separate analysis of lateralized values did not indicate important differences between hemispheres.\nWhite matter abnormalities have been detected using DTI in a wide range of studies, including those examining aging (Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006), affective disorders (Sexton et al., 2009), and other dementias (Firbank et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2009). As a result, to help differentiate between conditions, it is important not only to consider which regions display white matter abnormalities, but also which regions are unaffected. Effect size in occipital WM was not significant in MCI and small in AD, indicating that the occipital lobe may be a useful control region.\nIncreased severity (decreased MMSE) of the patient group was associated with greater absolute effect sizes in several regions (Fig. 4). This finding agrees with many studies that have found a significant association between decreased MMSE and reduced FA (Bai et al., 2009;Bozzali et al., 2002;Catheline et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2007;Duan et al., 2006;Mielke et al., 2009;Muller et al., 2007;Rose et al., 2000;Ukmar et al., 2008;Xie et al., 2005) or increased MD (Bozzali et al., 2002;Duan et al., 2006;Muller et al., 2007) either within or across groups in at least 1 region.\nVariability of outcomes was greater for MCI than for AD studies, possibly reflecting the fact that they represent a heterogeneous group of patients and that there are no universally recognized criteria. Where there was significant heterogeneity of effect sizes there was also an increased chance of detecting an effect of confounds, such as patient MMSE, age, and the proportion of female patients in the sample. There are a number of possible 2322.e11 C.E. Sexton et al.  Neurobiology of Aging 32 (2011) 2322.e5-2322.e18 explanations for this, including restricted variability of MMSE or WM abnormalities. This could reflect the early onset of white matter changes in MCI, or more trivially, the practical limitation to scanning AD patients beyond a certain level of impairment, where they may not be able to tolerate the MRI procedures, leaving a relatively smaller range of impairment represented among AD patients included in studies.",

    "Methodological considerations": {
      "text": "A significant degree of heterogeneity was detected in 12 group comparisons of FA. Attempted modeling with potential confounds indicated that both patient characteristics (MMSE, age, and percentage of women) and acquisition parameters (b value, voxel size, number of directions, number of excitations) contributed to heterogeneity in varying regions. Greater severity of cognitive impairment was associated with increased effect size, in line with previous studies. In addition, increased age was associated with reduced absolute effect size in FA, possibly due to more of the control group displaying age-related white matter abnormalities (Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006). More female patients in a study appear to be associated with a greater abnormality of DTI measures. This may be due to relatively fewer vascular brain abnormalities in female controls, resulting in a greater effect size (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2006). A key limitation of the regression analysis with patient characteristics is that it did not incorporate a measure of confounder variance within each study. For example, the standard deviation associated with mean age varied from 4.0 (Naggara et al., 2006;Taketomi et al., 2002) to 11.0 (Parente et al., 2008;Stahl et al., 2007), and mean MMSE from",

Also, studies varied in how well matched patient and control groups were for age and gender (Table 1). With regard to data acquisition parameters, increased NEX was most often associated with decreased absolute effect sizes. This somewhat counterintuitive result may be explained by the expected positive correlations of absolute effect sizes with numbers of diffusion-encoding gradient directions. The product of the last 2 determines imaging time, which is a resource factor of DTI experiments and tends to be limited in all patient studies. Regression analysis with acquisition parameters is thus limited as it examines each parameter separately, even though each acquisition parameter does not affect the quality of data independently. For example, Firbank et al. (2007) compared b values of 1000 and 4000 secondmm 2 and found that, although 4000 secondmm 2 may be more sensitive to differences in FA, a lower signal-to-noise ratio meant that slice thickness had to be doubled to obtain useable images. A further limitation of our regression analysis is that, as the majority of studies were performed at 1.5 T, many regions lacked a sufficient range to adequately investigate the effect of field strength.\nAlthough analysis of patient characteristics and acquisition parameters may help explain the variability observed, it was not possible to systemically investigate all possible sources of heterogeneity. For example, with regard to patient characteristics, a range of disorders have been associated with a reduction in WM integrity. Reduced FA in affective disorders is well documented (Sexton et al., 2009), but comorbidity was often not referred to in the inclusion or exclusion criteria.\nIn contrast to group comparisons of FA, only 3 group comparisons of MD displayed significant levels of heterogeneity. In addition to MD, it is also possible to calculate axial and radial diffusivities in order to examine diffusivity perpendicular and parallel to the WM tract respectively. As there may be increases in both axial and radial diffusivities in AD and MCI, it has been suggested that absolute diffusivities may be more reliable markers of degeneration than FA, which is a function of the ratio of these diffusivities (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010). Although our meta-analy- Sexton et al.  Neurobiology of Aging 32 (2011) 2322.e5-2322.e18 sis found comparable effect sizes for anisotropy and diffusivity in the majority of regions, this may help explain the increased variability of FA results.\nAs this meta-analysis only includes regions that were examined by at least 3 studies, a key limitation is type II error. For example, it was only possible to examine FA",

Also, it was not possible to examine the UF, SLF, internal capsule, and hippocampi for all group comparisons. Another possible source of bias results from studies that did not present means and standard deviations or p values for all regions studied. For example, some studies carried out an analysis of variance (ANOVA) across multiple ROI and groups, and subsequently only performed 2-sample tests on regions that were significantly different. On the other hand, we assumed p ϭ 0.049 if a study presented p Ͻ 0.05, so the effect size in these cases may have been underestimated.

    "Context of findings": {
      "text": "There is still much debate concerning the pathophysiology underlying the WM abnormalities in AD and MCI. In particular, it is unclear whether WM pathology is related to, or independent of, gray matter (GM) pathology. One theory proposes that microstructural WM changes occur as a result of Wallerian degeneration (Coleman, 2005). In this case, it follows that WM abnormalities parallel the pattern of gray matter pathology, which first occurs in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, before progressing to wider temporal and parietal association cortices (Braak et al., 1997). Alternatively, the retrogenesis hypothesis proposes that decreased WM integrity is the result of myelin breakdown that occurs in the reverse order to myelogenesis (Bartzokis, 2004;Reisberg et al., 2002). According to this theory, small diameter, early-myelinating tracts would be first affected. Finally, although vascular MCI and AD were excluded from our analysis, local microvascular changes may also contribute to WM pathology.\nWithin the studies included in our meta-analysis there is no clear consensus in support of one theory, with some studies concluding that their findings indicate Wallerian degeneration (Bozzali et al., 2002;Duan et al., 2006;Huang and Auchus, 2007) and others retrogenesis (Choi et al., 2005;Stricker et al., 2009). The anatomy of WM changes is one factor that can help differentiate between Wallerian degeneration or retrogenesis. For example, within the corpus callosum, the genu projects to the prefrontal cortex and myelinates later than the splenium, which projects to temporal and occipital lobes (Bartzokis, 2004;Zarei et al., 2006). In our meta-analysis, the effect sizes for FA were significant in AD and MCI for both the genu and splenium, but the effect size was greater for the splenium compared with the genu in all group comparisons (Fig. 5). This could therefore be interpreted as providing greater support for Wallerian degeneration than for retrogenesis. It is important to note, however, that our meta-analysis was not designed to specifically test either the Wallerian degeneration or retrogenesis theories, and results should be interpreted with caution.\nIn summary, diffusion tensor imaging is a sensitive method for detection of white matter changes in Alzheimers disease, but also in mild cognitive impairment. White matter changes generally follow the anatomical pattern of gray matter atrophy, supporting a Wallerian degeneration theory of white matter involvement in this condition.",

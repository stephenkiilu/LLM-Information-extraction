    "abstract": "Background: Degradation of white matter microstructure has been demonstrated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). In preparation for clinical trials, ongoing studies are investigating the utility of longitudinal brain imaging for quantification of disease progression. To date only one study has examined sample size calculations based on longitudinal changes in white matter integrity in FTLD. Objective: To quantify longitudinal changes in white matter microstructural integrity in the three canonical subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and AD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: 60 patients with clinical diagnoses of FTD, including 27 with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 14 with non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and 19 with semantic variant PPA (svPPA), as well as 19 patients with AD and 69 healthy controls were studied. We used a voxel-wise approach to calculate annual rate of change in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in each group using two time points approximately one year apart. Mean rates of change in FA and MD in 48 atlas-based regions-of-interest, as well as global measures of cognitive function were used to calculate sample sizes for clinical trials (80 power, alpha of 5). Results: All FTD groups showed statistically significant baseline and longitudinal white matter degeneration, with predominant involvement of frontal tracts in the bvFTD group, frontal and temporal tracts in the PPA groups and posterior tracts in the AD group. Longitudinal change in MD yielded a larger number of regions with sample sizes below 100 participants per therapeutic arm in comparison with FA. SvPPA had the smallest sample size based on change in MD in the fornix (n  41 participants per study arm to detect a 40 effect of drug), and nfvPPA and AD had their smallest sample sizes based on rate of change in MD within the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (n  49 for nfvPPA, and n  23 for AD). BvFTD generally showed the largest sample size estimates (minimum n  140 based on MD in the corpus callosum). The corpus callosum appeared to be the best region for a potential study that would include all FTD subtypes. Change in global measure of functional status (CDR box score) yielded the smallest sample size for bvFTD (n  71), but clinical measures were inferior to white matter change for the other groups. Conclusions: All three of the canonical subtypes of FTD are associated with significant change in white matter integrity over one year. These changes are consistent enough that drug effects in future clinical trials could be detected with relatively small numbers of participants. While there are some differences in regions of change across groups, the genu of the corpus callosum is a region that could be used to track progression in studies that include all subtypes.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "FTLD is a pathological term used to designate a group of neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes (Brun, 1987;Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). FTLD is associated with a variety of clinical presentations, including three of the most commonly described subtypes of FTD: bvFTD, nfvPPA, and svPPA (Johnson et al., 2005;Galantucci et al., 2011). These three syndromes differ in their clinical features, with bvFTD presenting primarily with changes in socioemotional function (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011;Seeley, 2008;Garcin et al., 2009), svPPA with loss of knowledge about words, and objects, and nfvPPA with agrammatism, nonfluent speech and articulatory difficulties (Wilson et al., 2009;Wilson et al., 2010). Yet the three syndromes are linked by a relatively limited number of underlying proteinopathies. The two most common molecular pathologies include abnormal depositions of Tau or TDP-43 (TAR DNAbinding protein 43) (Neumann et al., 2006;Baborie et al., 2011). In some cases, the clinical syndrome strongly predicts the underlying pathology, as is the case with svPPA, which is associated with TDP-43 type C in about 83 of cases (Spinelli et al., 2017), or autosomal dominant genetic cases of bvFTD, such as GRN or C9orf72 mutations, also associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, for the most part, clinico-pathological correlations continue to pose important diagnostic challenges. For instance, nfvPPA is often associated with tauopathy, although in certain cohorts a high frequency of TDP-43 pathology is reported 11, (Boxer et al., 2006). The bvFTD clinical syndrome remains the most pathologically heterogenous subtype, caused most frequently by TDP-43 and tau pathologies, less frequently FUS, in addition to other more rare pathologies (Spinelli et al., 2017;Mann and Snowden, 2017;Munoz et al., 2009;Grossman, 2010).\nAs it stands, there are no approved therapies for FTLD, however efforts to develop treatments are ongoing (Zhang et al., 2016;Rojas and Boxer, 2016). In preparation for future clinical trials, efficient measures of disease progression that allow detection of drug effects with the smallest possible number of participants need to be developed. The heterogeneity in clinical presentations of FTLD proteinopathies makes this problem particularly complex. Future therapeutic trials will target specific proteinopathies. Therefore, once a biomarker is available to identify the proteinopathy for each case of FTLD in vivo, the ability to enroll any patient with the targeted protein disorder, irrespective of the specificity of their symptoms, would increase power. Drugs targeting tau, for instance, may include bvFTD and nfvPPA patients. In such trials, it would be difficult to choose an appropriate specific symptomrelated outcome measure. Whereas language tasks may be appropriate for nfvPPA or svPPA, they would likely be insensitive to change in bvFTD within the optimal therapeutic window. Thus, in addition to global cognitive measures and assessment of functional abilities, there would be value in identifying quantifiable intermediate phenotypes, standing between the underlying molecular pathologies and clinical phenotypes. Such measures would be anticipated to be equally applicable to a variety of clinical syndromes, as well as perhaps especially needed for the study of specific subgroups, such as bvFTD patients with a slowly progressive, subcortical form of neurodegeneration (Ranasinghe et al., 2016).\nDiffusion tensor imaging, which utilizes measures of water diffusion to assess microstructural alterations in white matter, has been used in cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of white matter degeneration in FTD (Galantucci et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2016;Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2011;Agosta et al., 2014;Borroni et al., 2007;Mahoney et al., 2015;Matsuo et al., 2008;Schwindt et al., 2013;Whitwell et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2009;Lam et al., 2014;Floeter et al., 2016;Tu et al., 2016). This is consistent with pathological studies demonstrating that, in addition to neuronal cell death, FTLD brains also show substantial gliosis and degeneration of white matter tracts (Lant et al., 2014). Moreover, recent studies showed that longitudinal white matter changes over a 12 month period are more extensive than grey matter (Whitwell et al., 2010). Studies in bvFTD have demonstrated favorable effect sizes for white matter changes when compared to clinical or volumetric grey matter changes (Mahoney et al., 2015;Santillo et al., 2013). This suggests that longitudinal measures of white matter integrity may be excellent markers of pathological progression in FTLD.\nThe goal of this study was to quantify longitudinal changes in white matter integrity using DTI in bvFTD, svPPA and nfvPPA and to assess the utility of DTI as a metric of disease progression in each of these variants. In order to evaluate the specificity of the findings, we also examined longitudinal white matter changes in AD, a neurodegenerative disease affecting posterior rather than frontotemporal brain regions, with proteinopathies that differ from those noted in FTLD.",

Our control group was composed of participants who also had MRI scans approximately one year apart and were not given a diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease, and considered neurologically and cognitively normal (n  69). Patients included in this study were recruited between 2008 and 2016 through ongoing studies (AG019724, AG032306, AG023501) at the MAC. Diagnoses were based on a multidisciplinary evaluation including neurological exam and symptomatic evaluation, neuropsychological and nursing evaluations, and socioemotional assessments. Disease duration was estimated based on the year of initial symptoms provided by the patient or their informant. All study participants were provided informed consent and the study protocols were approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research.

DTI-TK implements a tensor-based registration paradigm, maximizing the alignment of white matter structures and minimizing interpolation of DTI images. Intra-subject templates were created through iterative non-linear and linear registration of baseline and follow-up diffusion tensor images. A similar process was repeated at the intrasubject level using the intra-subject templates to create a groupwise template. Deformations from native space to intra-subject space and from individual subject to group space were concatenated and applied to individual time point images, bringing them to groupwise space. Once in groupwise space, diffusion tensor images were diagonalized into eigenvectors from which fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were calculated.

    "Sample size calculations": {
      "text": "The results for voxel-wise sample sizes are displayed in Fig. 2, which shows maps of voxel groups yielding sample sizes between 50 and 400 participants per study arm. As expected, frontotemporal regions, with a slight left-predominance produced the smallest sample sizes for PPA groups, whereas the smallest sample sizes were found predominantly in frontal white matter for the bvFTD group. Additionally, consistent with the posterior predominance of white matter change in AD, the smallest sample sizes were within posterior cerebral regions in this group. Although smaller sample sizes were calculated based on voxel-wise change in MD in all groups, especially in the AD group, change in FA and MD showed a high degree of overlap (Fig. 2).\nFor ROI-based sample size calculations, we report on all regions yielding a sample size estimate of  100 participants per study arm, in at least one disease group (Table 2.A), and include tables with all samples size values across all 48 tracts investigated as Supplemental data. Using mean annual rate of change in FA, the svPPA group showed the largest number of regions with sample size below 100, followed by nfvPPA (Table 2.A). The smallest sample size for svPPA and bvFTD were in the genu of the corpus callosum (n  78 for svPPA; n  162 for bvFTD). Whereas, the smallest sample size for nfvPPA was in the left tapetum (n  72), and the smallest sample size for the AD group in the left sagittal stratum (n  91). More regions were found with small sample sizes based on MD measures. Using change in MD, the smallest sample sizes in FTD groups were in the fornix for svPPA (n  41), the genu of the corpus callosum for bvFTD (n  140), and for nfvPPA and AD, the left anterior limb of the internal capsule yielded the smallest sample size (n  49 for nfvPPA, and n  23 for AD).\nThe genu of the corpus callosum emerges as the region with the most consistent change in white matter across all FTD groups, and consequently the smallest sample sizes, taking all FTD subtypes into consideration. This was true for both FA and MD.\nCalculations based on annual rate of change in clinical measures, such as quantitative assessment of functional status with clinical dementia rating score (CDR), and global measure of cognition with the mini-mental status examination (MMSE), yielded favorable sample sizes for bvFTD and svPPA, respectively (Table 3). Based on the annual rate of change in CDR box scores a sample size of 71 participants per study arm was calculated for bvFTD, and with annual change in MMSE, a sample size of 86 was calculated for svPPA. The smallest sample size for nfvPPA was 200, based on annual rate of change in CDR box scores.\nOverall, annual rate of change in white matter integrity yielded sample sizes below 100 for all disease groups, except bvFTD. For the bvFTD group, annual rate of change in global assessment of functional status yielded the best sample size (Table 4).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study used DTI to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal change in the integrity of white matter microstructure in patients with FTD and AD. We sought to evaluate longitudinal DTI metrics (FA and MD) as surrogate biomarkers of disease progression for use in clinical trials. In each clinical variant, we identified regions of white matter where the rate of change was significantly faster in disease groups compared with controls. The patterns generally matched expectations, with changes over time occurring mostly in regions already affected at baseline. FTD groups showed change in anterior more than posterior brain regions, and the AD group mostly in posterior regions. In the PPA and AD groups, tracts were identified where annual rate of change in the white matter microstructure would permit detection of a moderate (40) reduction in rate of change in a drug trial to be observed with 100 or less subjects per arm. Change rates in white matter in bvFTD gave rise to larger sample sizes; the smallest sample size estimated in bvFTD came from change in global measures of functional status. These findings are generally consistent with prior studies and provide support for DTI as a potential measure of disease progression for clinical trials in FTLD and AD.\nWhen comparing longitudinal white matter degeneration across FTD subtypes we identified some differences across syndromes, but also significant overlap. SvPPA and nfvPPA showed degeneration in tracts that mediate communication with the temporal lobes, including the fornix, uncinate fasciculus, and tapetum. Correspondingly, these tracts are among those that generated the best effect sizes for svPPA and nfvPPA. At the same time, we found that the genu of the corpus callosum showed significant change in these two variants as well as in bvFTD, making it a good candidate region for longitudinal studies that might include more than one FTD subtype. The finding of areas of overlap in white matter degeneration across FTD subtypes is congruent with prior reports of overlap in degeneration of underlying functional networks, and the ensuing symptomatology, in particular between bvFTD and svPPA (Rosen et al., 2002a;Rosen et al., 2002b;Liu et al., 2004). Furthermore, the emergence of the corpus callosum as a tract with a relatively large effect size for change in three separate groups is a highly unlikely finding, and so provides some internal validation that the corpus callosum may indeed prove to be a valuable region for tracking white matter pathology. Interestingly, a recent study of white matter development and degeneration in a large group of healthy subjects ages 5-83 demonstrated that the corpus callosum was one of the first regions to show degeneration due to aging (Lebel et al., 2012).\nTo date, few studies have investigated longitudinal change in white matter integrity in FTD and AD (Frings et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2016;Mahoney et al., 2015;Lam et al., 2014;Floeter et al., 2016;Tu et al., 2016), and only one prior study has generated sample size estimates, specifically in bvFTD (Mahoney et al., 2015). Sample size estimates from that study of bvFTD were smaller than the estimates we generated in our bvFTD group. We note that the prior study used a diffusion gradient of 1000 smm 2 , and acquired two diffusion weighted scans. Both of these approaches might improve signal to noise ratio, contributing to the stability of measurements over time, and therefore generating a smaller sample size estimate. This should be addressed in future studies. Moreover, separate analyses of anatomically distinct groups of bvFTD, such as a slowly progressive, subcortical subtype (Ranasinghe et al., 2016), or genetic bvFTD cohorts may reduce variability and improve sample sizes in this pathologically heterogenous group. It is also notable that, in our analysis, MD generated lower sample size estimates than FA. That said, because this was a relatively small dataset, we did not do a formal analysis of whether MD was a significantly better measure of change in white matter than FA, and we would note that the prior longitudinal study of DTI in bvFTD produced lower sample sizes for FA compared with MD (Mahoney et al., 2015). Thus, any conclusion about which is the better metric for longitudinal tracking would seem premature. FA may have potential advantages over MD because FA is a measure of directionality in white matter tracts rather than absolute diffusion, and therefore increases in diffusion across white matter tracts could be balanced by increases along white matter tracts, which would decrease the magnitude of change detected in FA, without affecting MD. Furthermore, FA and MD reflect many processes that affect microstructural integrity including white matter cellularity and protein deposits, and the extent to which each of these aspects of pathology is involved in a particular form of neurodegeneration could influence the relative sensitivity of FA or MD (Racine et al., 2014). Given the complexity of these processes it is likely premature to make firm conclusions about the contexts in which FA or MD would be the most appropriate measure. Our finding that imaging measures generally allowed for lower sample size estimates than clinical measures is consistent with prior studies in FTLD showing that measures of grey matter volume (Knopman et al., 2009) and white matter integrity (Mahoney et al., 2015) require lower sample sizes than clinical measures. The one exception in this study was bvFTD, where the CDR sum-of-boxes score produced a lower sample size estimate than DTI. The finding that functional measures such as CDR are attractive for clinical trials in FTLD has been highlighted in prior studies (Knopman et al., 2008;Borroni et al., 2010). The fact that this measure was better than imaging specifically in bvFTD can best be interpreted in light of previous findings that the brain regions that change over time are quite heterogeneous across patients with bvFTD, which limits the ability of imaging to improve upon clinical measures (Binney et al., 2017). In contrast, because global measures of function capture the effects from a variety of impairments, they are somewhat immune to the variability in the specific cognitive and behavioral changes across patients. These observations provide support for methods that would create personalized metrics for disease tracking that are targeted at the clinical or imaging regions most likely to change in that individual, in line with prior proposals of multiple-n-of-1 designs in clinical trials (Irwig et al., 1995;Tsapas and Matthews, 2008). It will be important for additional studies to be done on independent, larger cohorts. Such studies will help confirm whether our sample size estimates are reasonable, while ascertaining whether there is consistency regarding the best regions for tracking disease over time. Voxel-wise sample size estimates represent a novel approach to sample size calculation that may produce more sensitive regions of interest tailored to each disease. Future studies could pursue empiric discovery of ideal regions for use as imaging biomarker for therapeutic trials, similar to what has been done for grey matter atrophy (Pankov et al., 2016). In addition, treatments aim to improve functional abilities that clinical measures, such as neuropsychological assessments, aspire to capture. While our data indicate that measures of change in the white matter microstructures could be a valuable surrogate marker of disease state progression, it will be important to verify the relationship between imaging biomarkers and functional and clinical measures before these measures could become acceptable outcomes in treatment studies. Additional work should also be done to define how clinical and imaging data can be best combined to assess both pathological disease state and clinical disease stage progression. Finally, future studies could investigate whether patterns of white matter change can help distinguish underlying molecular pathologies in sporadic as well as familial cases of FTLD at various stages of disease.\nIn addition to the utility of our findings for clinical trials, with progress in knowledge of molecular and cellular components of FTLD, the need for translational methods of quantifying the various components of pathology in vivo increases. Animal models and pathological studies in FTLD have established the importance of persistent microglial activation and the ensuing detrimental effects on white matter integrity. Therefore, the use of white matter imaging for studies of FTLD trajectories has the two-fold advantage of providing a pragmatic, shared measure of therapeutic intervention across clinical subtypes, as well as the potential for specific measurements of therapeutic effects for molecules targeting microglia and white matter degeneration. Last, according to the trans-synaptic hypothesis of spread of neurotoxic proteinopathies, longitudinal patterns of white matter degeneration represent a promising means of tracing the spread of disease.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated relationships between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings and clinical profiles in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) patients, along with differences in DTI parameters between cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders. Fifty-four INPH patients constituted the final group for analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity were assessed using atlas-based tract-mapping methods on 20 different fiber tracts. Uncorrected results revealed that CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, exhibited lower FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH), and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO) and higher axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity in the left CgH and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). FA values in the ATR (bilateral), corticospinal tract (right), IFO (bilateral), and ILF (bilateral) were negatively correlated with Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale motor scores. In the right CgH, FA values showed significant positive correlations with Korean-Mini Mental State Examination scores and negative correlations with Clinical Dementia Rating Scale scores. Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes of white matter in patients with ventriculomegaly as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders. Unique patterns of white matter microstructural changes, as measured using DTI, might underlie impairments in distinct symptom domains in patients with INPH.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is an adult-onset syndrome of uncertain origin, with symptoms of gait disturbance, cognitive deterioration, and urinary dysfunction, involving nonobstructive enlargement of the cerebral ventricles along with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure at lumbar puncture 1. Patients with INPH may present with varying combinations or degrees of each of these classic clinical symptoms. INPH is regarded as a potentially treatable syndrome by shunt surgery.\nIt has been suggested that the destruction of neural tracts associated with ventricular enlargement can precipitate the typical deficits of motor and cognitive function observed in INPH patients 1. Disorders of white matter are generally viewed as the principal pathological features of INPH 2,3. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter integrity not always detectable by routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 4. The most widely used DTI indices are fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) 5. DTI is an important tool for probing the effects of neurodegenerative disorders, including INPH 2,4,6.\nThe CSF tap test (CSFTT) has been known as a valuable tool for diagnosis in patients with INPH 7,8. The CSFTT response has been regarded as an important mark for the prediction of shunt effectiveness in patients with INPH and a valuable characteristic for understanding INPH patients 7,8. There may be relevant relationships between measures of white matter and CSFTT response heretofore unknown. One hypothesis is that certain microstructural changes of vulnerable connectivity in INPH may also affect CSFTT response. Analyzing DTI measures in various brain regions between CSFTT responders and non-responders might shed light on that issue.\nTo date, there have been a few investigations into specific relationships in INPH patients between DTI-based findings and clinical characteristics, but their results are inconsistent 3,4,9. For example, while FA and MD values in the corticospinal tract (CST) correlated with poorer cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 4, FA values within the CST did not correlate with the INPH Grading Scale (INPHGS) cognition score 9.\nWe broadly investigated 20 different fiber tracts (i.e., 9 tracts in each hemisphere and 2 inter-hemispheric tracts) utilizing DTI and automated atlas-based tract-mapping methods in a relatively large sample of INPH patients 10. The aims of the study are 1) to evaluate differences in DTI measures, including FA, AD, RD, and MD, in INPH patients relative to the outcome of their CSFTT and 2) to investigate relationships between DTI indices and various clinical profiles in INPH patients. We hypothesized that the topographical DTI features may be different according to CSFTT response, and there may be unique relationships between DTI findings and clinical characteristics.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our main result was that, among INPH patients in our study, CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, showed lower FA in the left ATR, left CgH, and left IFO and higher AD, RD, and MD in the left CgH and left ILF.\nAs an explanation for the lower FA values in the left ATR for CSFTT non-responders, we can speculate as follows. The ATR carries white matter fibers projected to the frontal cortex, including mainly the prefrontal cortex 3. Further, a study of INPH patients using single photon emission computed tomography showed that impaired functioning in the frontal lobe can play a role in shunt-responsiveness of INPH; and it was emphasized in this study that perfusion in the prefrontal cortex was relatively smaller in the shunt-nonresponsive group than in the shunt-responsive group 25. Considering the connection between the CSFTT and shunt-responsiveness 7, and the fact that a previous study has proved a close relationship between cerebral perfusion (also referred to as cerebral blood flow) and white matter microstructural integrity 26, we can hypothesize that a link between the CSFTT and white matter deterioration in ATR may exist. However, no previous study until now properly investigated this issue. Degenerative changes, reflected in FA decrease, in the ATR might contribute to the poor response to CSFTT in patients with INPH. And reductions in FA alone suggest a mixture of subtle differences in AD and RD 27. It seems that a small difference in microstructural alterations between two groups leads to lowered FA but no net differences in MD 27.\nAs a possible explanation for the lower FA values in the left CgH and left IFO and higher AD, RD, and MD in the left CgH and left ILF for CSFTT non-responders, we may speculate as follows. In a report on INPH cases, most of them were found to have Alzheimers disease pathology 28, and INPH with more severe Alzheimers disease pathology burden has been associated with shunt unresponsiveness 29. Furthermore, DTI has been regarded as one of the well-known neurodegenerative biomarkers in Alzheimers disease 30. Fibers located deep in the posterior white matter, such as the posterior cingulum adjacent to the hippocampus, are consistently found to be chiefly affected in Alzheimers disease in previous DTI studies 6,30,31. Recent MRI studies of diffusion tensor metrics in Alzheimers disease also highlighted the importance of these white matter regions from the fact that cingulum fiber disruption began near the parahippocampal regions and then progressed to the posterior cingulate regions with Alzheimers disease progression from the preclinical to the clinically-evident stage 31,32, whereas the cingulum region adjacent to the middle cingulate gyrus showed no FA reduction in Alzheimers disease 32. And Alzheimers disease-risk has been also associated with white matter integrity declines in the inferior temporal lobe white matter (IFOILF) 33. In the early stages of Alzheimers disease, white matter integrity of the IFO and ILF has deteriorated 34,35, and the ILF contains connections between medial temporal lobe areas affected early in the course of Alzheimers disease 35. The reason for CSFTT unresponsiveness is not well understood, but it is possible that the degree of coexistent Alzheimers disease pathology may influence responses to the CSFTT, and that this may be reflected in the changes in DTI parameters in our study. We cautiously suggested that non-responders may have a greater degree of comorbidity with Alzheimers disease than responders in the context of brain reserve. Further studies on INPH patients using additional biomarkers associated with Alzheimers disease would be needed to establish this hypothesis. In addition, various neurobiological processes involved in white matter degeneration can cause various tensor behaviors in different pathological states 5, and FA may lack sensitivity if water diffusion changes proportionally along the direction of all three eigenvectors 5. It has also been suggested that only diffusivity abnormalities can precede FA abnormalities in Alzheimers disease 30. Therefore, a lower FA with simultaneously higher AD, RD, and MD in the left CgH for CSFTT nonresponders likely reflects the more advanced white matter deteriorations than in other ROIs 27,30.\nAnother point in need of explanation is that, when comparing CSFTT non-responders to responders, regions that showed differences in diffusion measures were located mainly in the left hemisphere in our study. One potential explanation of the asymmetry is that some neurodegenerative diseases are believed to progress asymmetrically 36. For example, asymmetric brain atrophy has been reported in Alzheimers disease patients, and this asymmetry seemed to contribute to symptoms 36. In Alzheimers disease, it was suggested that the left hemisphere degenerated faster than the right 37. Additionally, Alzheimers disease is known as a prevalent comorbidity in older patients with INPH 28. Although, in INPH, information about asymmetry of damages is unclear, one previous study suggested that the reduction of cerebral blood flow was limited to the left frontal lobe in the shunt-nonresponsive group relative to the shunt-responsive group 25.\nWe also investigated relationships between FA and clinical symptoms of INPH. We found that unique patterns of FA values might relate to differential performance in distinct symptom domains in patients with INPH.\nRegarding parkinsonism, our results showed that parkinsonism severity as measured by the UPDRS motor score in INPH was largely such as INPH 39. There are several findings in the literature supporting our results. The CST is known as the major white matter for the transmission of neural command signals from the sensorimotor cortex to the spinal cord, and thus, its role in some aspects of motor symptoms may not be surprising 40. Furthermore, not only the ATR but also the CST is composed of white matter fibers projected to the supplementary motor area 3. The supplementary motor area is an important region of the brain that plays an important role in the planning, initiation and learning of complex motor functions, including gait 2. This region is also known to regulate upper limb mobility in INPH 41. Both IFO and ILF are the neocortical association pathways connected to the occipital lobe and these are known to affect visual processing 42. And visualmotor coordination is likely to play a role in performance on a number of the items assessed using the UPDRS motor score, such as toe and finger tapping and hand movements 43. Our findings indicate that DTI measures in the ATR, CST, IFO, and ILF may have potential use as biomarkers in the study of parkinsonism deterioration in INPH.\nRegarding cognition, significant correlations were chiefly found between FA values in the CgH and global cognitive function in our INPH patients, as measured by the K-MMSE and CDR. Interestingly, it was reported that hippocampal atrophy was associated with severe cognitive dysfunction in patients with INPH 44. The caudal portion of the cingulum is known to contain fibers that connect the posterior cingulate cortex with the hippocampus 45. In addition, hippocampus volume was significantly correlated with FA values of the parahippocampal cingulum and posterior cingulate cingulum 32. Our findings might be in agreement with these studies investigating the role of the cingulum in cognitive functions.\nAll subjects were selected in consecutive order from a prospectively enrolled INPH registry at our institute. And, in our study, we also believe that there might be merit in utilizing automated atlas-based tractmapping methods in a relatively large sample of INPH patients. One limitation of this study is that we did not have a normal control group, so we could not compare DTI measures of INPH patients against controls, and only comparisons between INPH subgroups were possible. A second limitation was that we did not investigate other methods of analyzing DTI data in our INPH patients. Third, in the analyses of the differences in DTI measures in INPH patients relative to the outcome of their CSFTT, all p-values are uncorrected and lack of significance at the corrected level seems to rely on a limited sample size. Therefore the results of this study need to be replicated in future studies. However, correction methods for type I errors are frequently too conservative and the optimal parameters are still unclear 46. We also assessed for group differences in mean FA, AD, RD, and MD for each ROI using a nonparametric permutation test (Supplementary Table 2).\nINPH patients in our study showed differences in FA values for the left ATR, left CgH, and left IFO and AD, RD, and MD values for the left CgH and left ILF depending on their response to the CSFTT. Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter integrity in patients with ventriculomegaly as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders. This study additionally showed that FA values in the ATR, CST, IFO, and ILF largely correlated with parkinsonism severity, whereas FA values in the CgH chiefly correlated with global cognitive performance. Unique patterns of white matter microstructural changes as measured using DTI might underlie impairments in distinct symptom domains in patients with INPH.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients show few significant macroscopic structural changes, especially at the early stages of the disease, making quantitative MRI especially interesting to explore more subtle changes that are not detectable by conventional volumetric techniques. Microstructural alterations have been reported in DLB at the dementia stage, but no study to date was conducted in prodromal patients. Here, quantitative MRI data were collected from 46 DLB prodromal patients and 20 healthy elderly subjects, who also underwent a detailed clinical examination including the Mayo Clinic Fluctuation Scale. We conducted voxel-wise between-group comparisons in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics and in R2 mapping, along with a multivariate analysis combining the two modalities. We highlighted multiple grey matter and white matter microstructural changes in DLB patients at the prodromal stage, compared to control subjects. Our multivariate analysis identified three distinct regional patterns of DTI and R2 changes (anterior, anteromedial, posterior) in DLB patients, that could reflect different neuropathological processes across brain regions. We also observed an association between R2 alterations in the thalamus, and the severity of fluctuations, in the DLB group. These preliminary findings are promising and require future investigations to better understand the biological underpinnings of microstructural alterations.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cognitive progressive disorder after Alzheimers disease (AD), accounting for 15-20 of pathologically diagnosed dementia cases (McKeith et al., 2017). Although the underlying brain mechanisms remain poorly understood, previous imaging studies highlighted that DLB, especially at the early stages, is characterized more by functional disturbances than by significant macroscopic structural changes (Bal ažov a et al., 2019). Compared to AD patients, DLB patients show a less pronounced global atrophy, with a more diffuse and less focal pattern (Bal ažov a et al., 2019;Watson et al., 2012) and a relative preservation of medial temporal lobes (Watson et al., 2016). Of note, atrophy of bilateral insulae and of the right anterior cingular cortex was also observed in DLB cases compared to healthy controls (Zhong et al., 2014), including at the prodromal stage (Blanc et al., 2016, Roquet et al., 2017). Apart from these findings, though, very few consistent structural changes were found at the early stages of the disease.\nIn many brain regions, it is thus possible that functional changes characterizing the prodromal stages of DLB co-exist with more subtle structural changes that are not detectable by conventional volumetric MRI techniques. Among recent techniques, quantitative MRI (qMRI) might be particularly relevant to explore such changes, as it reflects the physical properties of water underlying MRI contrast (Tofts, 2005). qMRI parameters can be used to characterize brain tissue properties, and could provide valuable additional insight on the pathophysiological processes occurring at the microstructural level (Draganski et al., 2011) in early DLB patients.\nOnly a small number of studies investigated microstructural changes in DLB, and most of these works used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters (Pierpaoli et al., 1996). Compared to healthy controls, DLB patients show white matter (WM) changes mainly located in parieto-occipital regions (Bozzali et al., 2005;Nedelska et al., 2015) and in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015;Kantarci et al., 2010;Kiuchi et al., 2011;Ota et al., 2009). One study (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015) also found WM alterations in the right anterior thalamic radiation and the left cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle. In addition to these WM DTI findings, one study (Su et al., 2015) evaluated quantitative changes in longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times in grey matter (GM) in DLB compared to normal ageing. DLB patients showed significant alterations in posterior regions -especially visual association areas-, and in basal ganglia.\nInterestingly, microstructural WM changes found in DLB patients in previous studies appeared to be independent of concomitant AD-related β-amyloid load (Nedelska et al., 2015). These alterations did not show an increased rate of deterioration when longitudinally compared to elderly controls (Firbank et al., 2016), suggesting that WM deterioration could occur relatively early in DLB progression, and be underpinned by different mechanisms than those observed in AD.\nFinally, as no study to our knowledge focused on patients in the prodromal stage of the disease, little is known about the onset of microstructural abnormalities in early DLB.\nIn this study, we conducted whole brain voxel-based analyses of multiple qMRI parameters, to investigate WM and GM microstructural changes in prodromal DLB patients compared to healthy elderly controls. The qMRI parameters included DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy FA, mean diffusivity MD, axial diffusivity axD and radial diffusivity RD), as well as the effective transverse relaxation rate (R2  1T2). DTI measures are sensitive to changes in water diffusion within biological tissues, and can thus reflect the disintegration of microstructural barriers (neuronal or axonal loss, demyelination) occurring in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Goveas et al., 2015). R2 is sensitive to iron related changes in brain tissues (Langkammer et al., 2010;Sedlacik et al., 2014;Uddin et al., 2016), that can reflect oxidative stress. Increased brain iron levels have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (Adlard  Bush, 2018) and Parkinsons disease (PD) (Jiang et al., 2019). Iron has also been shown to interact with Aβ, tau and α-synuclein to promote neurotoxicity (Duce et al., 2010;Jiang et al., 2019;Lei et al., 2012).\nWe hypothesized that prodromal DLB patients would show microstructural changes in regions that do not correspond to the pattern of macroscopic atrophy reported by previous studies focusing on this stage. We also expected that the profile of multivariate microstructural changes in the DLB group could be different from one region to another. Finally, we wanted to investigate the influence of these subtle alterations on cognitive fluctuations, one of the core symptoms of DLB.",

DLB patients were recruited through the Geriatrics and Neurology Departments of the University Hospital of Strasbourg (HUS) and the Geriatrics Department of the General Hospital Center of Colmar, which are member teams of the Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche (CM2R) Alsace, France. The recruitment of healthy participants was carried out by the Clinical Investigation Centre and CM2R of HUS.\nThe study was approved by the Est-IV ethics committee (CPP Est-IV, Strasbourg) and all participants provided written informed consent. To be included, the subjects had to be over the age of 50 years and be native speakers of French. Exclusion criteria were as follows: MRI contraindications, alcohol or substance abuse, sensory or motor disability, additional neurological or psychiatric conditions that could explain the symptoms, significant focal cerebral lesions shown on brain imaging, and cooccurrence of DLB and AD (for details, see the patient inclusion flowchart in Figure S2).\nDLB patients were diagnosed by experienced neurologists and geriatricians, based on the McKeith criteria (McKeith et al., 2017(McKeith et al., , 2020)), and control subjects were examined in the same way as patients to exclude any occult mild cognitive impairment or dementia cases. The potential presence of medial temporal atrophy was assessed using the Scheltens visual rating scale on brain MRI scans for the two groups. All participants underwent a detailed clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mayo Clinic Fluctuation Scale (Ferman et al., 2004). For a comprehensive description of the different neuropsychological assessments, see Kemp et al. (2017).",

Raw DTI imaging datasets were first corrected for field inhomogeneities using B0 maps. DTI scalar parameters (FA, MD, AxD and RD maps) were computed using dwi2tensor and tensor2metric functions from MRtrix3 software package ( (Veraart et al., 2013), https:www.mrtrix.org), while R2 maps were estimated using a log-linear (LL) least squares fitting method (Otto et al., 2011;Pei et al., 2015). In a second step, diffusionR2 maps were coregistered with the structural T1 images in each subjects native space, and then spatially normalized to a group specific template (of all subjects) using ANTs multivariate template construction tool (Avants et al., 2011). In keeping with the VBQ approach, no modulation of parameters values by the Jacobian determinants was applied during the normalization step. To minimize partial volume effects and preserve parameters values, we lastly performed a combined weightingsmoothing procedure (Draganski et al., 2011) with an 8 mm fullwidth at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian smoothing kernel on the quantitative maps.",

Age and gender were included in the design matrix as covariates of no interest. Considering the early stage of the disease in our DLB patients, we expected group differences to be subtle and we thus set the statistical significance at an uncorrected threshold of p  .001 at the voxel level (cluster extent: 50).\nWithin the DLB group, we also explored the potential correlation between microstructural changes and patients fluctuation scores, by adding these scores to the GLM model and assessing their effect on regional DTI and R2 values.\nSecondly, we performed a voxel-based multivariate analysis combining both DTI and R2 maps, to identify the brain regions showing a similar pattern of multiparametric microstructural changes. In a first step, we used the Stouffer method (Stouffer et al., 1949) to generate a spatial map that combined all significant between-groups quantitative parametric changes (FA, MD, AxD, RD and R2) in a global cluster. More specifically, we computed a single p-value for all considered parameters, based on the combination of the pvalues derived from the statistical group comparison maps of each separated parameter. We generated a mean cluster, corresponding to significantly changed voxels from all combined maps. We then applied a voxel-wise approach to assign a specific signature of parametric alterations for each voxel. Using a clustering algorithm, voxels showing a similar pattern of multivariate changes were finally extracted as sub-clusters, corresponding to specific brain regions (voxel-wise threshold: p  .01, cluster-wise threshold: p  .01, cluster extent: 500 voxels). Statistical results were represented as spider-plots.",

    "Voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging and R2 alterations in early Dementia with Lewy bodies patients": {
      "text": "Our VBQ analysis revealed a significant FA decrease in several focal WM areas, including the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). This result is consistent with earlier studies reporting ILF disruptions in DLB patients at the dementia stage (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015;Kantarci et al., 2010;Kiuchi et al., 2011;Ota et al., 2009), and further indicates that this alteration is already present at the prodromal stage. We also found an increase in diffusivity values (MD, RD and AxD) in several focal areas mainly located in the GM, in anterior brain regions such as the bilateral superior and middle frontal cortex and the right anterior cingular cortex. Although its precise biological underpinning remain unclear, increased diffusivity in GM is F I G U R E 4 (a-c) Clusters with significant multiparametric microstructural differences between DLB patients and healthy elderly subjects (p unc.  .01 voxel-level, p  .01 cluster-level, cluster extent: 500 voxels) are displayed in red, superimposed on a mean anatomical template. The three corresponding multivariate signatures are represented in radar plots. The dark blue circle corresponds to the mean parameter value of the control group, while circles of larger diameter indicate an increase from control value, and circles of smaller diameter, a decrease from control value. Significant differences between DLB and control groups are represented by light blue circles (p  .05 or z  2) and red circles (p  .01 or z  2). Abbreviations: AxD: axial diffusion, FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusion, RD: radial diffusion commonly associated to a breakdown of microstructural barriers (cell membranes, intracellular organelles, myelin) and an increased extracellular space (Le Bihan, 2003). Increased diffusivity values in GM regions have been reported in previous studies in AD and PD, and have been shown to correlate closely with clinical symptoms (Fellgiebel  Yakushev, 2011;Kim et al., 2013;Walhovd et al., 2009). In AD, these alterations have been hypothetically linked to neuronal loss, and could precede macroscopic atrophy in the early stages of the disease (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2012). In DLB, considering the minimal atrophy compared to AD, especially in the prodromal stage, these microstructural changes may reflect a reduced synaptic density, or neurodegenerative changes in axons and myelin in GM fibers, rather than neuronal loss. The location of diffusivity alterations in our DLB group is in accordance with previous studies (Chabran et al., 2020;Schumacher et al., 2018) highlighting early functional connectivity changes in fronto-parietal attentional networks in DLB patients. It is thus possible that microstructural changes may parallel the functional disturbances occurring in these regions at the prodromal stage (although further studies would be required to determine if such changes have a causativecontributing or a consecutive role regarding functional troubles).\nIn addition to DTI changes, prodromal DLB patients also exhibited a significant decrease in R2 values in a set of focal GM areas including the bilateral frontal cortex, the left superior temporal cortex, the right lingual fusiform gyrus and the bilateral brainstem (midbrain). We also found a decreased R2 in one WM cluster corresponding to the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. These findings contrasts with the increased R2 values and corresponding iron accumulation commonly observed in cognitive neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (Adlard  Bush, 2018;Peters et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2019) and PD (Jiang et al., 2019;Langkammer et al., 2016;Xuan et al., 2017). Of note, though, one study (Yu et al., 2013) reported decreased iron levels in the temporal cortex in PD patients postmortem brains and suggested that the mechanisms of iron homeostasis could differ among brain regions (leading for example to an accumulation if iron in the substantia nigra, along with a possible decrease in some other areas). Another study also highlighted significantly decreased R2 values in the substantia nigra and the putamen in patients with restless legs syndrome (Allen et al., 2001), and attributed this result to a potential iron insufficiency.\nThe decrease in R2 found in our prodromal DLB group may thus suggest a local dysregulation of iron homeostasis, and oxidative stress processes. R2 is a multi-determined parameter, which can be influenced by other tissular characteristics such as myelin density, or extracellular water content (Bagnato et al., 2018;Brass et al., 2006;Gelman et al., 1999). However, no significant concomitant DTI changes were found in the brainstem and the left superior temporal cortex in our VBQ analyses, suggesting that the R2 decrease in these two regions might reflect changes in iron content. Conversely, as increased MD and RD values were found in the frontal superior cortex, R2 alterations in this area may partly result from myelin and water content changes.\nOverall, our results highlighted multiple GM and WM microstructural changes in prodromal DLB patients compared to healthy elderly subjects. These alterations covered a wide range of brain regions that appear consistent with the clinical picture of DLB, and of which only a few (e.g., the right anterior cingular cortex) are known to be atrophied at the early stages of the disease. These group differences appeared to be subtle and did not survive a multiple comparisons correction, which was not surprising giving the early stage of progression of the patients, but also the primarily functional and diffuse nature of DLB.\n3.1.1  Regional profiles of multiparametric microstructural changes in early DLB Our multivariate analysis highlighted three distinct patterns of microstructural alterations in prodromal DLB patients compared to controls, suggesting that the underlying neuropathological processes could vary depending on the brain regions affected.\nThe first cluster included multiple GM areas, mainly located in anterior brain regions, and a few posterior WM areas. Its signature of microstructural changes consisted in mildly increased diffusivity values (with a higher increase of RD), a tendency of FA decrease, and a significant R2 decrease. Based on previous work, this pattern may reflect moderate microstructural alterations such as synaptic, axonal or dendritic loss, in brain regions undergoing functional disturbances consecutive to proteinopathy. The decrease in R2 might indicate a modulation effect of iron dysfunction on neuropathological processes.\nThe second cluster consisted of GM areas in the bilateral anterior cingular cortex, bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, and left inferior temporal cortex. It showed a different multivariate profile, with a greater increase in diffusivity values (p  .05 for MD, RD and AxD), no significant change in FA, and a trend of decrease in R2 (but which did not reach significance). The absence of significant change in FA, as well as the similar increase in RD and AxD might be explained by the fact that water diffusion is more isotropic in GM than in WM. Consequently, FA is considered less sensitive than diffusivity values to microstructural changes in GM (Chiapponi et al., 2013). Among the brain regions included in this cluster, the anterior cingular cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex correspond to areas connected by the cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundle, a WM tract which is disrupted in DLB patients at more advanced stages of the disease (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Esposito, et al., 2015). We did not find alterations of this tract in the present study, indicating that GM microstructural changes in the two above-mentioned regions could precede WM alterations in related WM tracts. In addition, the anterior cingular cortex is one of the only regions, together with the insulae, that show a GM loss at the prodromal stage in DLB subjects (Blanc et al., 2016;Roquet et al., 2017). These regions are both spatially close and structurally well connected to the olfactive bulb, and could be the among the first to be affected by alpha-synuclein pathology, according to the potential olfactive spreading pathway recently proposed by M. G. Cersosimo (2018). The signature of multivariate changes in this cluster could thus indicate specific microstructural alterations linked to proteinopathy, and potentially including neuronal loss.\nLastly, a third distinct pattern of microstructural changes was found in WM areas corresponding to the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus. DTI alterations consisted in a strongly decreased FA, consecutive to an increased MD with higher increase in RD than in AxD. Additionally, the R2 was also strongly decreased (p  .01). Interestingly, this pattern appeared globally similar in shape, but more marked, than the one observed in the WM sub-clusters of the first cluster (see Figure S1). It also differs from it in regard of AxD values, which in this case tended to decrease. This might suggest a more severe alteration of WM integrity, such as a loss of myelinated fibers.",

This suggests that cognitive fluctuations, that are a core symptom of DLB (Ferman et al., 2004) and have significant impact on patients quality of life and autonomy (Ballard et al., 2001), could arise from iron-related microstructural disturbances in this structure. This result is consistent with previous findings showing an association between the severity of fluctuations and the external functional connectivity of the left and right thalami in prodromal DLB patients (Chabran et al., 2020). It also concurs with another study combining DTI and proton MR spectroscopy (Delli Pizzi, Franciotti, Taylor, Thomas, et al., 2015), that reported microstructural alterations, as well as a cholinergic imbalance, in bilateral thalamic regions projecting to the frontal cortex in DLB patients (although only cholinergic measures correlated with fluctuations scores).",

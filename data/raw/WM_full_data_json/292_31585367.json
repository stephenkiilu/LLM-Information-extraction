    "abstract": "Our aim was to investigate the patterns and trajectories of white matter (WM) diffusion abnormalities in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutations carriers. We studied 22 MAPT mutation carriers (12 asymptomatic, 10 symptomatic) and 20 noncarriers from 8 families, who underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a subset (10 asymptomatic, 6 symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers, and 10 noncarriers) were followed annually (median  4 years). Crosssectional and longitudinal changes in mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy were analyzed. Asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers had higher MD in entorhinal WM, which propagated to the limbic tracts and frontotemporal projections in the symptomatic stage compared with noncarriers. Reduced fractional anisotropy and increased MD in the entorhinal WM were associated with the proximity to estimated and actual age of symptom onset. The annualized change of entorhinal MD on serial DTI was accelerated in MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers. Entorhinal WM diffusion abnormalities precede the symptom onset and track with disease progression in MAPT mutation carriers. Our cross-sectional and longitudinal data showed a potential clinical utility for DTI to track neurodegenerative disease progression for MAPT mutation carriers in clinical trials.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with behavioral and language disorders, executive dysfunction, and impaired social cognition (Bang et al., 2015). About 30-50 FTLD patients have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (Rohrer and Warren, 2011), with many showing mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene (Spillantini et al., 1998). Mutations in MAPT result in filamentous accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and glia leading to neurodegeneration, atrophy, and white matter (WM) microstructure alterations years before the onset of clinical symptoms (Bunker et al., 2006;Cash et al., 2018;Dopper et al., 2014;Ingram and Spillantini, 2002;Kantarci et al., 2010). Families with MAPT mutations provide a unique opportunity to investigate early disease-burden brain changes and identify biomarkers for tracking disease progression in the context of potential diseasemodifying therapies.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to the WM micro-structure alterations, such as loss of myelin and axonal membranes. Loss of WM microstructural integrity on DTI was associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of tau protein and Braak staging of the neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology in Alzheimers disease (Bendlin et al., 2012;Kantarci et al., 2017). Damage to WM caused by tau pathology is a frequent observation in postmortem examinations of genetic and sporadic cases of patients with FTLD (Kovacs et al., 2008;Larsson et al., 2000;Sima et al., 1996) and in animals expressing tau mutations (Gotz et al., 2001;Lin et al., 2003). Recently, focal myelin injury was identified as the first manifestation of tauopathy in a tauP301L mouse model (Jackson et al., 2018). Despite the growing literature of DTI findings in patients with FTLD and in asymptomatic carriers of the granulin (GRN) (Pievani et al., 2014) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutations (Bertrand et al., 2018), few studies have demonstrated microstructural WM changes in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers (Dopper et al., 2014;Jiskoot et al., 2018Jiskoot et al., , 2019;;Panman et al., 2019). We hypothesized that DTI measures of WM microstructure occur early in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers and the trajectory of DTI changes are associated with the disease progression during longitudinal follow-up.\nOur objectives were 1) to determine the DTI abnormalities across all WM regions of interest (ROIs) to distinguishing asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers from noncarriers; 2) to estimate the relationship between diffusion abnormalities and proximity to symptom onset in MAPT mutation carriers; 3) to compare the trajectory of DTI changes on serial DTI in MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers.",

The behavioral neurologist (BB, JGR, NGR, DJ, or DK) who examined all of the participants was blinded to the mutation status. None of the participants fulfilled the exclusion criteria.\nInclusion criteria include the following: 1) participants are eligible for enrollment if they are members of families with a known mutation in MAPT and are aged 18 years or older, and preferably above age 30 years; 2) the predominant phenotype in the kindred should be cognitivebehavioral (i.e., kindreds in whom behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) or primary progressive aphasia is the predominant clinical phenotype among affected relatives is favored over parkinsonism or ALS, although all phenotypes are eligible for enrollment); 3) a reliable informant who personally speaks with or sees that participant at least weekly; 4) participant is sufficiently fluent in English to complete all measures, 5) willing and able to consent to the protocol and undergo yearly evaluations, 6) willing and able to undergo neuropsychological testing (at least at the baseline visit), and 7) no contraindication to MRI.\nExclusion criteria include 1) absence of a known mutation in MAPT in the participant or family; 2) presence of a structural brain lesion (e.g., tumor, cortical infarct); 3) presence of another neurologic disorder which could impact findings (e.g., multiple sclerosis); 4) unwillingness to return for follow-up yearly; 5) unwillingness to undergo neuropsychological testing and MRI; and 6) no reliable informant.",

Baseline characteristics were compared among asymptomatic, symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers, and noncarriers using logistic mixed effect models for sex and linear mixed effect models for the other variables. These models were adjusted for age at DTI where appropriate, and accounted for within-family correlations. Tukey contrasts based on the mixed models were used for pairwise comparisons for continuous variables.\nThe weighted median of the tract-based MD and FA values derived from WM JHU atlas ROIs combining the right and left hemispheric regions were determined. Because age influences DTI measures, we used the data from the noncarriers to estimate the age effects on DTI measures and adjusted the MD and FA values in the MAPT mutation carriers for age. Predicted probabilities accounting for family mutation was used to calculate the estimates area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) for each ROI to distinguish the MAPT mutation carriers from noncarriers. The DTI values from the asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT carriers were compared with noncarriers, and ranked according to AUROC values. Because we were conducting comparisons in 43 different ROIs, we adjusted for multiple comparisons to control the familywise error rate. Significant after correction for multiple comparisons were displayed on a rendered single-participant transparent brain for visualization (Fig. 1).\nThe association between DTI values and time to expected age of onset and time past age of onset was tested using multiple linear regression analysis after adjusting for age. We tested interactions between time from symptom onset and groups in FA and MD in these models. A significant interaction would produce a change in the estimated slopes at the time of symptom onset.\nTo assess the longitudinal DTI abnormalities, we modeled DTI metrics from each individual time-point to estimate annualized rate of change in FA and MD. The annual changes in FA and MD over time were modeled to compare MAPT mutation carriers to noncarriers using linear mixed-effect models with random subject-specific intercepts and slopes, while accounting for within-family correlations. Owing to the small sample size of this group, we only analyzed regions that showed abnormal FA and MD values in the cross-sectional analysis in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers. We coded group (noncarriers, asymptomatic, or symptomatic) using dummy variables with noncarrier as the reference, and included two-way interactions for group  age at MRI scan.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal DTI abnormalities in asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers. Our main findings are 1) elevated MD in the entorhinal WM is present as early as the asymptomatic stage in MAPT mutation carriers; 2) the WM degeneration extends to the limbic tracts and the frontotemporal lobe WM in the symptomatic stage; 3) higher MD and lower FA in the entorhinal WM are associated with the proximity to the estimated and actual age of symptom onset; and 4) longitudinal increase of MD in the entorhinal WM accelerates with aging in MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers.\nThe WM alterations on DTI can be linked to a variety of degenerative changes in the WM of MAPT mutation carriers. Progressive accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and glia caused by the MAPT mutation can impair the neuronal and axonal transport (Coleman, 2005;McAleese et al., 2017), and initiate a degenerative loss of axons and associated demyelination in FTLD (Adalbert et al., 2018). Furthermore, WM tau pathology were also observed in postmortem studies of MAPT mutation carriers (Sima et al., 1996), sporadic FTLD patients (Kovacs et al., 2008;Larsson et al., 2000), and animals expressing mutant tau (Gotz et al., 2001;Lin et al., 2003), even in the asymptomatic stage (Ling et al., 2016), indicating that WM degeneration occurs early and is a significant component of pathophysiology in MAPT mutation carriers.\nIn the present study, DTI findings in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers revealed higher MD in the entorhinal WM, which harbors the perforant pathway connecting the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. This early entorhinal WM involvement is concordant with the pattern of gray matter atrophy predominantly involving anteromedial temporal lobe in MAPT mutation carriers (Rohrer et al., 2015) and FTD patients (Fumagalli et al., 2018;Whitwell and Josephs, 2012). Entorhinal cortex is affected heavily with the tau pathology and subsequent atrophy, with a volume loss of about 28 in FTD patients compared with controls (Laakso et al., 2000). However, it is not yet clear if the entorhinal WM diffusion abnormalities are due to the Wallerian degeneration secondary to the cortical tau pathology or to the tau pathology observed in the WM. Pathologic correlation would be needed to determine the underlying pathophysiology of these WM changes in MAPT mutation carriers.\nPrevious cross-sectional studies have demonstrated reduced FA and increased diffusivity in bilateral uncinate fasciculus in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers (Dopper et al., 2014;Jiskoot et al., 2018). Furthermore, lower FA in uncinate fasciculus and other WM tracts were present 2 years before symptom onset in converters with MAPT and GRN mutations, whereas no difference in FA was found between asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers who remained asymptomatic and noncarriers (Jiskoot et al., 2019). In the present study, we found diffusivity changes in the uncinate fasciculus only in symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers, while we did not find an alteration in diffusivity in the asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers in this tract. On the other hand, MD was higher in the entorhinal WM in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers. This discrepancy may be related with region specific involvement at the different time windows during the disease process. It is possible that uncinate fasciculus may be involved right before conversion to symptomatic disease as demonstrated by Jiskoot et al., and many of the asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers we studied may not have reached that stage. However, our findings in symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers demonstrate that uncinate fasciculus is involved at later stages.\nThe DTI findings in symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers revealed a pattern of increased MD and reduced FA primarily involving the WM connections of the limbic system network. Except for the entorhinal WM, increased MD was also observed in the fornix, which primarily carries the efferent projections from neurons of the hippocampus and from the subiculum to the subcortical gray matter and back; the uncinate fasciculus, which connects the anterior temporal lobe with the inferior frontal gyrus and the base of the frontal lobe; the cingulum tract, which carries hippocampal projections to the medial parietal lobe; the corpus callosum, which is the major commissure integrating the 2 hemispheres; the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, which connects the frontal and occipital lobes with some branches also terminating in the parietal and temporal lobes. This pattern of DTI alterations involving the limbic pathways connecting the anterio-medial temporal lobe to the subcortical gray matter, from temporal lobe to basal portion of frontal lobe and from frontal lobe to occipital lobe, is consistent with most of the DTI studies in patients with FTLD (Bertrand et al., 2018;Dopper et al., 2014;Elahi et al., 2017;Frings et al., 2014;Kassubek et al., 2018;Mahoney et al., 2015;Pievani et al., 2014;Whitwell et al., 2010).\nWe found an association between the entorhinal WM diffusion abnormalities and the proximity to symptom onset, characterized by decreasing FA and increasing MD as the participants approached the estimated age of onset that continued with a similar trend after passing the actual age of onset in the symptomatic group. Furthermore, with a median 4 years of follow-up, our longitudinal data provided information on annualized rates of change in DTI metrics, indicating that the annualized rates of increase in entorhinal WM MD in MAPT mutation carriers was faster than noncarriers. These findings demonstrated that the loss of WM integrity related to neurodegeneration occurred years before symptom onset and progressed over time in MAPT mutation carriers. A similar pattern of diffusion abnormality was reported in converters with MAPT and GRN mutations, demonstrating longitudinal decline of FA in uncinate fasciculus, genu and posterior corpus callosum, forceps minor, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Jiskoot et al., 2019). Increasing MD and decreasing FA were also found in animal models of tauP301L mutations, along with the WM pathology. Increased diffusivity and lower FA were detected in the WM during the early stages preceding severe tauopathy, and got worse with a disorganized pattern of myelinated fiber arrangement with enlarged interaxonal spaces in the later stage (Jackson et al., 2018;Sahara et al., 2014).\nThe association of entorhinal MD with proximity to symptom onset was mainly driven by the symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers. A possible explanation is that entorhinal WM integrity was already impaired before symptom onset, but accelerated after clinical symptom onset. This is supported by our cross-sectional findings of higher MD in the entorhinal WM of asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers compared with noncarriers. The accelerated increase of entorhinal MD was also noted in our 2 asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers after they progressed to the symptomatic stage (Fig. 3).\nMD was more sensitive than FA in detecting the longitudinal diffusion abnormalities in the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages, correlating with the disease progression in MAPT mutation carriers as they aged. These differences may in part be explained by variations in underlying pathological findings with disease progression. Elevation of MD in the asymptomatic stage and accelerating during the symptomatic stage may be related to the astrogliosis, laminar spongiosis (Sima et al., 1996) and micro-vacuolization (Mann et al., 1993) that would lead to an increase in free water in the extracellular space observed in MAPT mutation carriers during early stages of pathologic involvement. On the other hand, the consistent decline in FA may be due to a gradual loss of WM organization because of deafferentation in the projections from the ventral frontal and temporal lobe throughout disease progression, which may be linked to the neurodegenerative changes in the gray matter. FA could also be influenced by crossing fibers more than MD, which may have limited the sensitivity of FA to detect subtle WM degeneration (Jeurissen et al., 2013).\nIn our longitudinal cohort, we observed that 3 symptomatic carriers of the V337M MAPT mutation, from the same family, with disease duration up to 31 years had relatively lower MD values in entorhinal WM than symptomatic carriers of the S305N MAPT mutation with even shorter disease duration. Interestingly, the unusually delayed symptom onset and long duration was reported in another FTLD family with V337M mutation (Domoto-Reilly et al., 2017). Further studies are needed to fully characterize the WM abnormality and heterogeneous clinical presentation across different mutation types.\nLimitations of our study include a small sample size and the unbalanced representation of MAPT families in carrier and noncarrier groups. Larger cohorts of asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers are needed to longitudinally follow and establish the patterns of WM diffusion changes in specific tracts. Furthermore, the right hemispheric WM tracts had higher MD than the left but no difference in FA values in MAPT mutation carriers. Whether this asymmetry observed in this sample is generalizable to other samples need to be clarified in larger data sets. In addition, DTI remains an indirect measure of WM integrity. Although different DTI metrics may reflect different processes, linking them to specific pathologies remains challenging. Further studies are needed to characterize and compare the trajectory of change across different FTLD mutations, such as GRN and C9orf72 mutations. Multishell DTI that enable measurements of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (Zhang et al., 2012) and multitissue constrained spherical deconvolution (Jeurissen et al., 2014) may address more specific characterization of tissue microstructure in MAPT mutation carriers than conventional DTI in future studies. Because heterogeneity was a common feature in symptom onset across different MAPT mutationsfamilies and within the same family, future studies by tracking the trajectory of DTI alteration in MAPT mutation carriers with respect to the actual time of symptom onset during a longitudinal evaluation would provide more information.",

Our cross-sectional and longitudinal data showed a potential clinical utility for DTI to track neurodegenerative disease progression for MAPT mutation carriers in clinical trials.

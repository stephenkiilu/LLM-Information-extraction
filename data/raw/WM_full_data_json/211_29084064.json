    "abstract": "Purpose of review We review recent MRI research that addresses two important challenges in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) research: early diagnosis, and linking SVD with cognitive impairment. First, we review studies of MRI measurements of blood flow and blood-brain barrier integrity. Second, we review MRI studies identifying neuroimaging correlates of SVD-related cognitive dysfunction, focusing on brain connectivity and white matter microarchitecture. This research is placed in context through discussion of recent recommendations for management of incidentally discovered SVD, and neuroimaging biomarker use in clinical trials. Recent findings Cerebral perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), blood-brain barrier permeability, and white matter microarchitecture are measurable using MRI, and are altered in SVD. Lower cerebral blood flow predicts a higher future risk for dementia, whereas decreased CVR occurs at early stages of SVD and is associated with future white matter hyperintensity growth. Two new approaches to analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in SVD patients have emerged: graph theory-based analysis of networks of DTI connectivity between cortical nodes, and analysis of histograms of mean diffusivity of the hemispheric white matter. Summary New, advanced quantitative neuroimaging techniques are not ready for routine radiological practice but are already being employed as monitoring biomarkers in the newest generation of trials for SVD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) makes an oversized contribution to risk for stroke and dementia 1,2. Yet the disease is often underdiagnosed, and there are few disease-specific treatments 3.\nSVD has diverse pathomechanisms and cerebral manifestations (Fig. 1) 4. There are a host of putative mechanisms of brain injury in SVD 5, including vessel occlusion, leakage of toxins, impaired vascular reactivity, decreased clearance of waste products, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, increased oxidation, and inflammation (Fig. 1). This complexity contrasts with large artery disease, in which brain injury results almost exclusively from thromboembolism with resulting brain ischemia and infarction. An important objective of SVD neuroimaging research is to develop in-vivo markers of these processes.\nA key challenge in SVD diagnosis and research is that the affected arteries and veins are too small to be directly visualized in vivo. Instead, SVD must be diagnosed by inference, based upon associated patterns of brain injury. Identifying early physiological changes that precede vascular brain injury could allow prevention to be implemented before irreversible injury occurs.\nAnother diagnostic challenge in SVD is determining the clinical relevance of patterns of SVD for individual patients, where it can be difficult to judge whether the load of SVD is sufficient to result in a clinical cognitive syndrome such as MCI or dementia. Recent criteria from the International Society for Vascular Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders proposes that one large infarct or hemorrhage, a strategic infarct or hemorrhage, multiple lacunes, or extensive and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of vascular origin may be sufficient 6. However, there is little validation of these thresholds and the relationship between lesion location and the resulting cognitive syndromes are not fully understood.\nWe review recent research that addresses these two important challenges in SVD diagnosis and management. First, we review recent neuroimaging research on how two important functions of vascular physiology -delivery of blood flow and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity -are disturbed in patients with SVD. Second, we review recent SVD research identifying neuroimaging correlates of cognitive dysfunction. Specifically, we review recent advances in detecting microinfarcts, the lesion type that may be most closely associated with cognitive impairment, as well as studies of loss of brain connectivity in SVD. Next, we review a recent synthesis of the clinical relevance of neuroimaging signs of SVD before describing future directions in research.",

    "SMALL VESSEL DISEASE AND CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW": {
      "text": "Delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain is the most critical function of the cerebral vasculature. SVD is associated with lower cerebral blood flow (CBF). A systematic review of 24 cross-sectional studies 7   found that more severe WMH burden is associated with lower global, gray matter, and white matter CBF (findings corroborated by subsequent studies not included in the meta-analysis 8,9).\nWhat is less clear is whether low CBF is a cause or a consequence of WMH. As CBF is tightly regulated to meet tissue demands, it is expected that CBF will decline in damaged tissues. The systematic review by Shi et al. 7   found only four relevant longitudinal studies of CBF and WMH that provided",

      "text": "Recent neuroimaging research on SVD is addressing challenges of identifying early stage changes in vascular physiology that precede vascular brain injury, and understanding the relationship between SVD and cognition.\nA scientific statement from the American Heart Association synthesizes information on neuroimaging diagnosis of silent SVD in routine clinical care, offering practical suggestions for work up of causes and risk factors, and management to prevent future symptomatic stroke.\nAdvanced neuroimaging measures of cerebral perfusion, CVR, and DTI of white matter microarchitecture are being employed as monitoring biomarkers in the latest generation of trials for SVD and vascular cognitive impairment. FIGURE 1. Complexity of cerebral small vessel disease. Vascular disorders lead to abnormalities in vascular function, causing brain injuries which interfere with brain networks and result in clinical impairments. Advanced, quantitative neuroimaging techniques are increasingly able to assess aspects of vascular dsyfunction (such as cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier permeability) which precede tissue injury, and to quantify the degree of disrupted network connectivity. contradictory findings, with individual studies reporting that greater WMH volume at baseline was associated with decreasing CBF, that lower CBF at baseline was associated with more WMH volume progression, and that increasing CBF in certain brain regions was associated with progression of WMH volume. Supporting cerebral hypoperfusion as a cause of WMHs, lower CBF within normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) neighboring WMHs is associated with both future development of WMHs and greater structural damage of white matter 10  ,11. Overall, findings related to the mechanistic role of cerebral hypoperfusion in the development of WMH are somewhat discordant. As CBF may be maintained or even increased during the early stages of SVD and decreased during the later stages, this discordance may have resulted from variations in the populations studied.\nThe predictive value of brain blood flow for clinical events was recently shown using data from the Rotterdam study, a large population-based study. The investigators found that lower CBF, quantified using 2D phase-contrast imaging of the internal carotid and basilar arteries, was independently associated with increased risk for incident dementia in the 7 years following the baseline assessment (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31, 95 confidence interval per SD decrease in CBF: 1.07-1.61;\nOverall, greater incorporation of noninvasive, high resolution, contrast-free MRI quantification of CBF (e.g., arterial spin labeling) into longitudinal population-based and patient-based studies will allow greater insight into the role of CBF in SVD disorders.",

    "IMPAIRED VASCULAR REACTIVITY": {
      "text": "The cerebral vasculature serves as a conduit for blood flow, but is also a highly dynamic organ that constantly works to adjust blood flow to meet tissue needs. Emerging evidence suggest that SVD-related impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) contributes to the ischemic consequences of SVD 13,14  . CVR is defined as the ability to augment CBF in response to either increased metabolic demand (i.e., neuronal activation) or a vasodilatory stimulus e.g., inhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and its quantification provides an index of cerebrovascular (dys)function when compared with the appropriate control group. Impaired CVR could lead to episodic local ischemia, demyelination of white matter, and cortical microinfarcts.\nIn studies of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the second-most common form of SVD, reductions in the occipital lobe blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI response to a visual stimulus has been investigated as a surrogate of CVR, because the BOLD signal depends on blood flow (as well as tissue metabolic activity) 15,16. Additional research in patients with a rare CAAcausing genetic mutation shows that the impaired BOLD response appears early, before clinical hemorrhages begin 17  . Furthermore, visual BOLD responses progressively decline over time, according to a small longitudinal study of 22 patients with sporadic CAA and 16 controls 18  . However, persons with lobar microbleeds but without a clinical history of CAA did not exhibit impaired visual BOLD responses in a small case-control study nested within the population-based Rotterdam study 19.\nStudies in SVD caused by non-CAA-related arterioloscerosis have begun using CO 2 as a more specific vasoactive stimulus, providing a measure of microvascular function throughout the brain (Fig. 2). A recent systematic review found only five relevant studies published between 1990 and 7 May 2015 with two studies reporting that greater WMH severity is associated with a lower CVR, but the remaining three studies finding no relationship between CVR and WMH volume 20  . These discordant findings are likely due to the differing CO 2 stimuli and patients used within each study, as well as relatively small sample sizes. However, after publication of that review there are increasing numbers of studies assessing CVR using BOLD imaging 21,22  ,23 or ASL 24 and using more comparable CO 2 stimuli. The major finding from these studies were that a reduced CVR in NAWM precedes the development of WMH 21,22  , a reduced NAWM CVR is associated with greater disruption of white matter integrity 22  ,23, and a lower CVR is associated with an increasing number of lacunes in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical microinfarcts and leukoencephalopathy 24.\nThese recent findings on CBF and impaired reactivity have motivated new clinical trial efforts to intervene to improve perfusion and blood flow regulation that are using quantification of CBF with or without CVR imaging as a monitoring biomarker. These trials include the ongoing LACI-1 clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02481323), PASTIS clinical trial (NCT02450253), PRESERVE clinical trial (http:www.preserve.org.uk), and the SVDstarget program (http:cordis.europa.eu ID: 666881).",

    "BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY": {
      "text": "The BBB plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the vasculature and regulating the influx of nutrients and signaling molecules from the bloodstream into the brain, and the efflux of wastes out of the brain into the bloodstream. Early proof of principle studies, using either neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis, suggest that BBB leakage is a common feature of SVD 25.\nThe most common neuroimaging method for quantifying BBB function, originally developed for oncology applications, uses dynamic contrastenhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to image the slow leakage of a gadolinium-based contrast from the vascular space into the extracellular fluid space 26. A limitation of this technique is that a long acquisition time is needed to be sensitive to slow rates of leakage, which are often not visible to the naked eye.\nTwo recent cross-sectional studies show that higher SVD severity is associated with higher BBB permeability in multiple brain regions. In the first study, 102 participants with a range of WMH had DCE-MRI measures of BBB permeability in WMH, NAWM, cortical gray matter and deep gray matter. Both K trans (representing the rate of leakage) and the area under the curve (representing the total leakage) were higher in all brain regions in patients with greater global WMH burden, adjusting for age 27  . In the other study, 80 patients with lacunar stroke or mild vascular cognitive impairment were compared with 40 controls 28  . The leakage volume was higher in cases in WMH, NAWM, and cortical gray matter, but the leakage rate (K i ) was only higher in NAWM, compared with controls. These studies are concordant in that they both show that BBB dysfunction is widespread in the brains of patients with SVD, being detectable in visually normal tissue as well as lesional tissue such as WMHs. The reason for the differing relationships with leakage rates is unclear but may be related to differences in image acquisition and postprocessing between the two studies.",

    "MICROINFARCTS": {
      "text": "According to autopsy studies, microinfarcts may be the single SVD lesion type that is most closely associated with cognitive impairment 29, perhaps because they can be so numerous.\nIn this context, new neuroimaging standards and definitions for microinfarct detection have recently been proposed (Table 1) 30  . Applying these definitions should standardize microinfarct assessments across studies, increasing comparability and facilitating multicenter research on microinfarct prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and associations with cognitive impairment and decline.",

      "text": "SVD-related subcortical damage can disconnect brain regions. Advances in processing and analysis Example positive blood oxygen level dependent CO 2 cerebrovascular reactivity maps for a 66-year-old male patient with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (left) and a 62-year-old male healthy individual (right) in response to a 2-min hypercapnic challenge (inspired gas concentration: 5 CO 2 , 21 O 2 , balance N 2 ). The difference in blood oxygen level dependent signal before and after CO 2 inhalation was divided by the increase in exhaled end-tidal CO 2 concentration. In comparison with the healthy individual, the patient with cerebral amyloid angiopathy exhibits widespread lower cerebrovascular reactivity in the cortex and hemispheric white matter.\nof diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) are offering new, better ways of measuring this phenomenon.\nDTI provides a measure of the diffusivity of water protons, which diffuse more freely along the orientation of white matter tracts rather than perpendicular to them. In postprocessing, DTI data can be used to mathematically compute the course of major white matter tracts such as the corticospinal tract, or to derive metrics of the overall range and shape of diffusion such as mean diffusivity.\nA new DTI analysis method exploits the concept that the brain functions as an interconnected network of cortical nodes to derive mathematical metrics of brain connectivity based on graph theory. In this method, the cortex is parcellated into regions based on anatomic boundaries using automated software, and then DTI processing methods are used to determine the strength of DTI connections between each node (Fig. 3). This method was first used in a case-control study of lacunar stroke patients and controls, showing that network efficiency was lower in patients than controls and was more closely associated with cognitive dysfunction than traditional measures such as WMH severity 31. Subsequent research has independently replicated these findings 32,33   and has shown that decreased network efficiency predicts conversion to dementia in SVD patients 34  , and prominently affects richly connected nodes 35,36. Patients with CAA also exhibit reduced network efficiency 37 that progresses over time 38   and is associated with cognitive impairment and decline.\nOther methods to assess global white matter dysfunction are based on analysis of histograms of mean diffusivity in the entire hemispheric white matter, without examining specific tracts or regional connections. In a multicenter case-control study, peak width of the skeletonized mean diffusivity, reflecting increased variation in mean diffusivity in an individuals white matter, was associated with SVD but not neurodegenerative diseases, and explained more of the variance in cognitive processing speed than conventional measures such as WMH or lacunar volume 39  . Another study by a different group found that DTI histogram metrics were sensitive to change over a 3-year interval, FIGURE 3. Schematic of graph-theory based analyses of structural white matter connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging. The cortex is parcellated into discrete regions based on functional and neuroanatomic boundaries (left), which are considered to be nodes in a whole-brain network. Next, diffusion tensor imaging tractography is used to calculate the strength of connections between each node (the edges of the graph). (For sake of simplicity, all possible connections are not displayed in the schematic). From this information, mathematical metrics of network efficiency can be calculated such as global network efficiency and network density.\nTable 1. Criteria for detecting microinfarcts on MRI",

Adapted from 30 although in this case they found that mean diffusivity peak height was the most sensitive 40  . These new methods confirm the importance of white matter disconnection as a major contributor to the clinical symptoms in SVD. These methods appear to be more sensitive to group differences and cognitive variation than the burden of lesions visible as WMH and lacunes. This increased sensitivity may be because they are continuous, quantitative measures; they reflect global dysfunction in the entire white matter; and because they are sensitive to subtle disruptions in microarchitecture in tissue that appears normal to the naked eye.\nAnother method to interrogate connectivity uses rs-fMRI to analyze correlated BOLD signal fluctuations at rest. Analyses can extract networks of connected activity (such as the default mode network) using principal components analysis or similar techniques, use cortical regions as seeds to determine their connectivity to other regions, or examine regional homogeneity. Early, small-scale studies using case-control designs suggest that these techniques may hold promise for discriminating SVD cases from controls and may also associate",

For radiological diagnosis, the Statement recommends using the STRIVE terms and definitions for WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and other lesions, and that WMH should be clinically reported using a standardized scale such as the Fazekas scale. Although high-quality evidence from clinical trials is currently lacking, the Statement proposes that clinicians should be aware that SVD is associated with a higher risk for future stroke, and that it is reasonable to consider this information when making decisions about primary stroke prevention strategies such as whether to anticoagulate patients with atrial fibrillation or to give aspirin.",

      "text": "SVD is a complex disease. An increasing number of manifestations can now be imaged, reflecting early-stage physiological dysfunction and more clinically relevant consequences such as white matter disconnection.\nHowever, challenges remain. With so many MRI markers, new techniques will be needed to understand how they interrelate and evolve over time. In addition, newer, quantitative MRI techniques require substantial postprocessing that makes them impractical for routine radiological practice at the present time.\nCurrently, the advanced techniques may be most appropriate for use as biomarkers for monitoring, prognosis, and treatment effects in observational studies and clinical trials. However, many of these markers are in the early phase of development. As such, they will require further harmonization and standardization for use in multicenter Finds associations between DTI measures and cognition in a five-site multicenter study with similar effect sizes as previously seen in single-center studies, suggesting that DTI can be implemented across multiple sites with robust associations with cognition. 50.",

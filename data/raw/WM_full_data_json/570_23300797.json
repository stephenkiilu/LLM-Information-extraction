    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline in old age. In its early stages, AD is associated with microstructural abnormalities in white matter (WM). In the current study, multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and brain volumetric measurements were employed to comprehensively investigate the landscape of AD pathology. The sample comprised 58 individuals including cognitively normal subjects (controls), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients. Relative to controls, both MCI and AD subjects showed widespread changes of anisotropic fraction (FA) in the corpus callosum, cingulate and uncinate fasciculus. Mean diffusivity and radial changes were also observed in AD patients in comparison with controls. After controlling for the gray matter atrophy the number of regions of significantly lower FA in AD patients relative to controls was decreased; nonetheless, unique areas of microstructural damage remained, e.g., the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus. Despite sample size limitations, the current results suggest that a combination of secondary and primary degeneration occurrs in MCI and AD, although the secondary degeneration appears to have a more critical role during the stages of disease involving dementia.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "In recent years, novel methods of neuroimaging have enabled biological tissues to be investigated in vivo 1,2. One of the most useful of these techniques is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which is sensitized to the motion of water molecules as they interact within tissues, thus reflecting characteristics of their immediate structural surroundings 3,4. DTI signal is an indirect measure of various aspects of tissue integrity and may be influenced by myelin density, membrane intactness and possibly other fiber components 5,6. Diffusivity represented by the water motion in a particular region can thus be altered by ordered structures such as axonal tracts in nervous tissues 7. Because diffusivity oriented by the fiber direction (anisotropic) is largely restricted in the gray matter (GM), an increase in anisotropic diffusion may correlate with myelin sheath content, thus being a valuable tool in assessing the microstructure integrity of white matter (WM) fiber tracts 8. By sampling the diffusivity along multiple directs spaced on a sphere a representation of the ellipsoid can be computed 4,8. DTI uses measures derived from the eigenvectors that define the diffusion ellipsoid in each voxel 4. Axial diffusivity reflects the diffusion coefficient along the principal eigenvector (l1), whereas radial diffusivity indicates the average diffusion coefficients along the two axes perpendicular to l1 Mean diffusivity (MD) is a measure of the total amount of diffusion within a voxel and is computed as an average of all three diffusion axes 4. Finally, fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value between zero and one and it is calculated from the eigenvalues (l1, l2, l3) of the diffusion tensor 4; this parameter indicates the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. Diffusion properties associated with multiple DTI measures can be interpreted as reflecting different structural contributions to WM integrity. The coherence of the orientation or directionality of water diffusion is reflected by FA, which is thought to provide an overall assessment of WM integrity 4 and is the most commonly used parameter in DTI studies 9. MD depends on the density of physical obstructions such as membranes and the resultant distribution of water molecules between different cell compartments 6. MD is a measure of overall gross diffusion and higher MD values point to increased diffusion and suggest tissue breakdown with increased brain water content 4. Axial and radial indices provide more specific information about the integrity of axons versus their surrounding myelin sheaths: an increase in radial diffusivity has been linked with loss of myelin in animal studies of experimentally induced myelin loss 10,11; in contrast, a decrease in axial diffusivity has been reported in rodents and in the majority of DTI studies with humans, being associated with axonal swelling and fragmentation 11,12.\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline in old age 13. The pathology of AD stems from the deposition of two proteins bamyloid and tau 14, which leads to a loss of cortical neurons with consequent cerebral atrophy 15. Even though cortical disease has been primarily considered in AD, increasing evidence from DTI has reported diffusivity changes in AD to WM degeneration and anatomical loss of connectivity which may be associated with different mechanisms, including axonal damage and demyelination 16. It is hypothesized that myelin pathology leads to bamyloid axonal damage in the WM tracts thus increasing the vulnerability to neurodegenerative processes which culminate in the clinical symptoms of AD 17.\nNewly proposed criteria for AD and its preclinical states encourage the use of DTI and other biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis in those likely to develop cognitive disorders 12, but the clinical significance of diffusion indices deserves a more comprehensive understanding. Early DTI studies have employed FA alone or in combination with MD 9. It has also been suggested in AD and MCI patients that an increase in radial and axial diffusivities may be more reliable markers of degeneration than FA, which is a function of the ratio of these diffusivities 18,19 and may not be able to detect subtle changes in WM 19. Furthermore, recent reports suggest that the sensitivity of radial diffusivity to the changes that occur in WM during normal aging is higher than that of axial diffusivity, possibly because the former is more closely associated with myelin breakdown 20; conversely, other studies indicate that axial diffusivity increases are more useful in identifying early changes (e.g., axonal damage) in AD 12. Because of these constraints, the investigation of multiple indices of DTI may help to develop a more comprehensively understanding of the landscape of diffusion changes in AD 18192021. Another less explored topic is the association of brain volumetric changes observed in cortical and subcortical areas with DTI findings. Two main pathophysiological hypotheses leading to the WM damage have been discussing by the recent literature: according to the Wallerian degeneration model, degradation of WM microstructure can occur secondary to GM pathology resulting from the accumulation of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau protein, deposition of b-amyloid 22, oligodendrocyte death and reactive gliosis 23; conversely, the retrogenesis theory suggests that WM degeneration results from a pattern that is the reverse of myelogenesis with late-myelinating pathways being first affected by AD (specially in the neocortical projections), and earlymyelinating pathways affected later in the disease 17,24.\nAmong the voxel based methods, Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) 25 is a powerful technique for investigating WM microstructure. TBSS has additional advantages in comparison to conventional region of interest (ROI) oriented DTI, specifically a higher accuracy in differentiating between cerebrospinal fluid and GM and the possibility of aligning data onto a WM skeleton, thus minimizing the effects of misalignment 25. Additionally a higher reliability and reproducibility of TBSS has been demonstrated by previous studies 18,20,26,27.\nThe objectives of this study are twofold. First, we sought to describe and investigate the main DTI changes in subjects with different cognitive status using the FA, MD, radial and axial indices in order to characterize and compare the patterns of WM microstructural changes between these groups. Secondly, we investigate the underlying WM pathology in distinct brain areas using two complementary procedures: the interpretation of FA, MD, radial and axial diffusivity changes through the overlapping between those indices; the correlation between anisotropic values in regional WM tracts with volumetric findings in gray matter, WM, and whole brain.\nWe hypothesize that multiple indices of diffusion would be altered in the early stages of cognitive decline and that WM degeneration may follow a distinct and progressive pattern that becomes more pronounced and widespread in more severe disease states. Based on the recent literature 18192021282930, we wanted to assess whether or not Wallerian degeneration andor retrogenesis contributed to WM damage.",

Participants were submitted to a broad standardized clinical assessment including geriatric, neurological, neuropsychological and psychiatric exams to define clinical status. A panel consisting of three neuropsychiatrists with expertise in dementia research (FKS, CEA, EE) made clinical decisions, including the assignment of CDR rating. The cognitive assessment included the CAMCOG 31, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 32, semantic verbal fluency (animal category), Clock Drawing Test (CLOX1) 33, Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B 34, and the 12-item Boston Naming Test 35.\nDiagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) amnestic (single or multiple domain) was established according to the Petersen criteria 36 as follows: (a) memory complaint corroborated by an informant, (b) objective memory impairment corrected for age, education and gender; (c) essentially preserved general cognitive function; largely intact functional activities, (e) not demented. To fulfill the item b of the Petersen criteria we assessed the memory performance in the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAM-COG) 31. Because of educational heterogeneity in the sample, normative values suggested by a previous study with 292 elderly subjects in the Alzheimers disease Center of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro were adopted 37. Subjects with cognitive performance 1.5 S.D. below the quartile values recommended by this study for age and education were included as MCI. All MCI individuals had an overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 38 of 0.5 and scored below 4 in the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire 39 and were included if they were subtype amnestic (single or multiple domain). AD patients met the diagnostic criteria of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer disease and Related Disorders (NINCDS-ADRDA) working group 40. Clinical diagnosis was reviewed periodically for a period of two years after the beginning of the study during which regular medical evaluations were performed, and cases that converted to any type of non-AD cognitive disorder were excluded. During the time of the study, patients family members (or spouses) were evaluated by the same protocol as outlined above and were selected as healthy older controls if they fulfilled the criteria for this group.\nExclusion criteria for all participants were a history of seizures, major psychiatric disorder, motor and sensorial impairment, dementia, impaired thyroid function, abuse of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence. Clinical, structural and DTI data presented in this study were acquired at baseline and analyzed in 2011 at the Laboratory of Neuroscience (Dept. of Psychiatry) and the Institute for Neuroradiology of the Goethe-University, Frankfurt.",

This created a calculation of the amount of warping needed for the images to be aligned. The most representative image was determined as the one needing the least warping for all other images to align to it. This target image was affine-aligned into 16161 mm 3 MNI152 standard space. Each FA image was then transformed into MNI152 space by applying their respective nonlinear transforms to the target and then the affine transform to MNI space. The aligned FA images were averaged to create a mean FA image which was thinned using an FA skeletonization program (threshold FA value of 0.2). This identified all fiber pathways consistently across all subjects, FA data were then projected onto the mean FA skeleton that is common to all participants 25.\nA standard approach with the simple permutation function (randomize, v 2.1) in FSL was used on the skeletonized data to calculate voxel wise differences between AD, MCI and controls. Voxel wise statistics were carried out using a General Linear Model (GLM) and voxelwise group comparisons were performed using simple two sample T-test 54. As the mean years of age tended to be higher in AD and there were statistically more females in the control group (Table 1), these two variables were input as covariates in the voxel wise analysis. The number of permutations was set to 5,000; the level of significance was adopted at p,0.05 level and corrected for multiple comparisons using the 2D parameter settings with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), a method which avoids using an arbitrary threshold for the initial cluster-formation 55. In order to characterize the different patterns of neurodegeneration, overlapping areas between FA and MD and FA and radial diffusivity were identified and their clinical meaning discussed.\nFollowing analysis with randomize and the creation of the WM skeleton, ROI areas were created using a semi-automated procedure that incorporated 20 structures identified probabilistically by the Johns Hopkins University WM tractography Atlas 565758. These structures were: anterior thalamic radiation Left Right (LR), corticospinal tract LR, cingulum (cingulate gyrus) LR, cingulum (hippocampus) LR, forceps major, forceps minor, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus LR, inferior longitudinal fasciculus LR, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) LR, uncinate fasciculus (UF) LR, SLF temporal part LR. An intersection between statistical significant TFCE images threshold at 5 and each atlas ROI was done in order to create a mask that belongs to a particular anatomical tract.

Current findings are in line with previous reports, which have found FA decreases in both AD and MCI patients in the corpus callosum, cingulum fibers, prefrontal cortex 16,63,64; significantly lower FA in the UF in the AD 65 and in the frontal callosal fibers in the MCI group 66 in comparison to controls have already been reported. The present findings support that in a preclinical stage of dementia widespread changes in FA are associated with WM primary atrophy. Conversely, no significant differences in DTI indices were found between AD and MCI, a finding consistent with recent TBSS-based investigations 16,20,26,67. FA overlaps were clearly observed between MCI and AD. The areas of significant lower FA in AD relative to control overlap to a large extent with the anatomical distribution of FA decreases in MCI relative to control. As previously reported by some studies 16,64, these results suggest a continuum for anisotropic changes over pre and dementia stages, with WM changes becoming progressively more evident as the cognitive level declines.\nSimilarly to our results, FA overlaps were previously described for the cingulum 64,68, frontal corpus callosum 68 and UF 27,69. Moreover results suggest that for WM tracts of particular importance in AD, the patterns of neurodegeneration may follow an anatomical gradient, with more severe disease states showing more widespread pathology. This was observed in the UF, largely compromised in AD while in MCI patients DTI changes were more restricted to the frontal lobe. The UF connects the subgenual cortex to the inferior temporal lobe 70 and there is equivocal evidence for its involvement in pre-symptomatic AD, with DTI changes being reported by some TBSS studies 26,27 while others found no changes 20,67. The UF is a long association tract with prominent connections to the fronto-orbital cortex, amygdala, temporal lobe and the subgenual region of hippocampus 71. It has been linked to the episodic memory network functioning 72737475. In the current results MCI and control subjects had no statistical differences in GM atrophy and the voxelwise analysis revealed a pattern of damage in UF quite similar to the AD-controls comparison in the model 2 (Figure 4). These results suggest that damage to the UF follow an anterior to posterior gradient which may be associated with the retrogenesis hypothesis in the early stages of neurodegeneration, when there is still no large scale gray matter atrophy. In later stages of the disease, when dementia is already manifest, hippocampal atrophy can further compromise the parts of the UF that lie within the temporal pole 18. It is plausible to hypothesize that within the UF, retrogenesis is the first mechanism of damage followed by the Wallerian degeneration. However caution is needed with the interpretation of our data, since there is some evidence showing that in MCI hippocampus atrophy may contribute to UF changes 76.",

The absence of statistical significant voxels in regional WM tracts may rely on the small sample size of the groups. An alternative explanation may be related to the complexity and dynamic of changes regarding the axial diffusivity index, as pointed by previous literature 26,787980. When possible myelin damage occurs, axial diffusivity may be initially decreased. In later stages, this decrease may be followed by increases in this parameter as cellular debris is cleared by microglia 78,79.",

      "text": "Our findings show that in the left anterior cingulum and left genu and body of the corpus callosum areas of gross tissue loss (low FA-high MD) coincided to a large extent with regions of myelin damage as indicated by low FA and high radial diffusivity. The meaning of DTI changes of the anterior segment of corpus callosum (which includes genu and anterior body) has been highlighted in recent investigations with pre-clinical AD 29,818283. The anterior portion of this bundle is responsible for the interhemispheric connection between the prefrontal association cortices and is implicated in monitoring information in working memory and in the active retrieval of information from posterior cortical association areas 82,84,85. Contrasting with posterior corpus callosum atrophy, generally more associated with Wallerian degeneration, the anterior atrophy of these tracts has been reported as closely related to myelin breakdown 82. Our findings for overlapping DTI indices in the AD group (Figure 4) suggest therefore that the underlying pathology of anterior corpus callosum is related to myelin breakdown. Di Paola et al. 82 Table 3 have shown that myelin breakdown is a key mechanism in Alzheimers Disease and according to the retrogenesis hypothesis it may affect late myelinating fibers 86 such as the UF, limbic pathways and callosal fibers 87. Some authors postulate that AD begins with damage to myelin 17. This process may involve amyloid and tau accumulation arising as byproducts from homeostatic repair mechanisms that are activated by this demyelination process 17.",

    "Findings Related to the Localization of Diffusion Changes": {
      "text": "Diffusion changes in both MCI and AD patients were predominantly distributed in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and corpus callosum, while in the AD group the left temporal was also compromised. Even though discrepancies in the literature exist, with some DTI studies with AD patients reporting WM changes in anterior regions 888990, while others found a greater occurrence of posterior changes 62,91, a different approach to the interpretation of diffusion changes has been proposed by the recent literature 87. In this perspective, the characterization of WM degeneration pattern in AD should be more focused on the prediction of WM changes in vulnerable late-myelinating fiber pathways, rather than looking for anterior versus posterior gradients of changes 21,87.",

    "Correlation of Regional DTI Changes with Structural Data": {
      "text": "In MCI patients, primary atrophy of WM was the main structural variable associated with diffusion changes in the anterior thalamic radiation, cingulate gyrus, forceps minor, SLF and UF. These correlations endorse the results of voxelwise analysis (Figures 3 and4) in which late myelination fibers are more vulnerable to primary pathological modifications on pre-dementia stages 17.\nAs expected, we also found a positive correlation between FA in the hippocampal cingulum and GM volume. Hippocampal fibers connect the prefrontal and parahipocampal cortices 92,93. Disruption between hippocampal cingulate and memory brain networks has been implicated in the development of cognitive decline, as outlined by MRI and functional studies 9 and may be associated with early atrophy of the hippocampal cortex, as demonstrated by previous studies supporting the Wallerian degeneration model 9.\nIn AD patients, global WM hyperintensities burden correlated with low FA in several tracts, particularly in the anterior thalamic radiation, SLF and UF. These lesions may often reflect small vessel pathology but are also frequently observed in AD. Our results support the view that frontal WM hyperintensities contribute to the clinical syndrome of AD. However the regional pattern of WM burden is still controversial, with previous reports showing a higher vulnerability for different areas such as the forceps minor 94; likewise it is still unclear how the distribution of these lesions could interact with Ab pathology in AD 95 and further studies are needed to elucidate the interaction of WM macrostructural changes and AD pathology.\nOur study has a number of limitations that deserves discussion. Firstly the interpretation of the results is limited since there was no follow up on the DTI changes. There was a large SD of the MCI group for MD, axial and radial indices (Figure 1) and widespread FA changes were found in both AD and MCI, but and surprisingly, they were found to a greater extent in MCI in the left forceps minor and the right putamen. The reason for such discrepancies is not clearly understood but might reflect the heterogeneity in this cohort. Our conclusions are also restricted by the small sample size which prevented further comparisons between amnestic single domain and multiple domain MCI groups. Additionally, some MCI subjects of the current study can be already considered pre-clinical AD patients and may already show similar increases in MD, axial and radial diffusivities as those found in the AD group. According to the new diagnostic criteria\n(not yet validated for clinical studies) MCI due to AD has been considered a high risk group for conversion to AD and a highly accurate categorization is possible by combining positron emission tomography and lumbar puncture 96. Because these instruments were not part of the study protocol, categorization between MCI converters and non converters could not be established. Future studies need to integrate DTI indices to other biomarkers in preclinical dementia. The interpretation of FA results has been questioned more recently, especially in relation to its specificity as a biological marker of disease progression. Some authors have suggested that FA should not be interpreted alone, because this index lacks sensitivity when diffusion changes proportionally along all three eigenvectors 18. Finally we used a 1.5 Tesla machine, what might have limited the accuracy of our findings. Nevertheless, studies with a similar MRI technology reported diffusions changes in many analogous WM tracts as ours 636465; recent evidence with probabilistic tractography, which allows to trace pathways from crossing-fiber regions, also give support to our findings, by evidencing that the SLF, UF, corpus callosum (entire extension) and cingulate bundle are the most affected WM tracts in AD 80.\nThere is a marked diffusion changes in the UF and frontal callosal fibers in MCI and AD patients favoring the retrogenesis model as a primary mechanism of degeneration followed by a Wallerian degeneration over the course of the disease. We found that was a degree of both direct white matter pathology as well as a degree of GM atrophy. A global picture of the current results for late myelinating fibers is more likely to sustain the retrogenesis hypothesis. Nevertheless, evidence supporting the Wallerian Degeneration theory was also found, since our results showed that in demented individuals DTI changes reflected progressive changes in GM atrophy namely in the temporal lobe. Therefore neurodegeneration patterns of DTI changes may vary in conformity with cognitive status, being independently associated in MCI subjects with WM microstructural changes of the prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal lobe while on later stages WM pathology may be more strongly associated with GM atrophy.\nOur results indicate that an integrative approach of DTI and volumetric analysis may give insights to the investigation of WM landscape pathology in AD. Further research oriented on the anatomical specificity of microstructural abnormalities of WM fibers will help to integrate DTI findings (especially axial and radial changes) and volumetric data on the clinical scenario.",

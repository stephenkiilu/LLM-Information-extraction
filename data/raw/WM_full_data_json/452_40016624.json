    "abstract": "We investigated whether aquaporin-4 (AQP4) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence Alzheimers disease (AD) progression through changes in the glymphatic system. We included 242 non-dementia participants and chose six SNPs previously shown to be related to AD. We analyzed the associations between AQP4 SNPs and glymphatic markers, including enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), white matter free water (FW), and diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. We investigated whether AQP4-related glymphatic markers are associated with AD pathology progression and cognitive impairment, and whether they mediate the relationship between AQP4 SNPs and AD progression. There was no association between AQP4 SNPs and glymphatic markers at baseline. Carriers of the AQP4 SNP rs72878794 minor allele status exhibited slower FW increase in the amyloid-positive group (SNPtime: β  -0.0040, t(46.25)  -2.062, p  0.045, 95 CI  -0.0078  -0.0001), whereas the rs9951307 minor allele carrier showed a faster FW increase in the amyloid-negative group (SNPtime: β 0.0033, t(81.19)  2.245, p  0.027, 95 CI  0.0004  0.0062). The higher FW was associated with faster cognitive decline at follow-ups. AQP4 SNPs influence interstitial fluid accumulation, contributing to cognitive decline but not amyloid deposition in AD. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathways linking AQP4 SNPs and AD progression.

    "Background": {
      "text": "The glymphatic system has been described as a garbage truck of the human brain (Nedergaard 2013). Studies demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can flow into the perivascular spaces (PVS) surrounding penetrating arteries and enter the brain interstitial space through aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels located on the endfeet of astroglial cells, where CSF and interstitial fluid (ISF) mix and efflux, taking away brain metabolic wastes (Benveniste et al. 2017;Iliff et al. 2012;Nedergaard and Goldman 2020). Impairment of the glymphatic system may lead to the accumulation of pathological proteins, such as amyloidbeta (Aβ) and tau (Tiwari et al. 2019), the core pathologies of Alzheimers disease (AD) (Keshavan et al. 2021), and contribute to the development of various neurological disorders (Fang et al. 2022;Vittorini et al. 2024).\nAlong the glymphatic pathway, the AQP4 channels are a crucial component (Mestre et al. 2018). They form abundant pores in the cell membrane, creating a high permeability that is essential for the rapid CSF -ISF exchange and waste clearance (Rasmussen et al. 2018); Zeppenfeld et al. (2017). Utilized brain autopsy data from non-AD and AD patients and found that the loss of perivascular AQP4 localization was associated with an increased amyloid burden. Through stereotactic injection of HiLyte 555 Tau into the brain of AQP4 KO mice, Ishida et al. (Ishida et al. 2022) found that tau was cleared from the brain to the CSF by an AQP4-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AQP4 gene may alter the functionality of AQP4 proteins and influence glymphatic function. Several recent studies found that variations in the AQP4 gene might accelerate Aβ deposition and cognitive decline in humans (Burfeind et al. 2017;Chandra et al. 2021;Rainey-Smith et al. 2018). Nonetheless, there is a lack of human studies validating whether an altered glymphatic function mediates the association between gene variations and AD progression. Because AQP4 is also related to many other water exchange processes and degeneration mechanisms (Saadoun et al. 2005;Verkman 2012), clarifying the role of glymphatic clearance is necessary.\nCurrently, a few non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers are considered to be related to glymphatic alterations. First, dilation of PVS, the main conduit of glymphatic flow, has been found to be associated with aging, hypertension, Aβ, and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (Zeng et al. 2022). The dilation was considered a compensatory restructuring of PVS in response to reduced glymphatic flow (Brown et al. 2018). Second, interstitial water content assessed by free water (FW) imaging may reflect fluid stagnation due to glymphatic dysfunction. A previous study (Gomolka et al. 2023) found increased parenchymal water diffusivity in mice with AQP4 water channel deletion, supporting the association between parenchymal water content measured by MRI and glymphatic dysfunction. Third, diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) (Taoka et al. 2017), an index measuring fluid transport in the perivenous space along the deep medullary veins, has demonstrated a good association with glymphatic clearance measured by DCE-MRI (Zhang, Huang, et al. 2021;Zhang, Zhou, et al. 2021). While there are still debates regarding whether they could reflect global glymphatic function, these markers have been chosen due to the paucity of available MRI markers. Several previous studies have demonstrated their close association with clinical status and pathological deposition (Hong et al. 2024;Kamagata et al. 2022;Perosa et al. 2022).\nIn the present study, we aim to study whether AQP4 SNPs are associated with glymphatic function and clinical progression in non-demented older adults. Specifically, we aim to study (1) the association between AQP4 SNPs and glymphatic markers through both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and (2) whether changes in glymphatic markers mediate the association between AQP4 SNPs and AD progression.",

Specifically, we removed the SNPs that were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p  0.05) (Hosking et al. 2004) and had a minor allele frequency of  5 (Tabangin et al. 2009). Linkage disequilibrium-based SNP pruning (Hill and Robertson 1968) was performed to reduce statistical redundancy and maintain coverage of the AQP4 gene. From the rest of the SNPs, six SNPs that had been shown to be clinically relevant in AD were chosen. The results are shown in Figure S1.

FW was associated with global cognition, memory, and executive function in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. These results may provide insights for understanding the influence of AQP4 SNPs on the glymphatic system and AD progression. This is the first in vivo study revealing the effect of AQP4 SNPs on WM FW. FW is a diffusion imaging marker that measures the fraction of water content with unrestricted and isotropic diffusion. An elevated FW may reflect an increase in ISF (Duering et al. 2018;Zhang, Huang, et al. 2021;Zhang, Zhou, et al. 2021). Because AQP4 proteins are crucial for the CSF -ISF exchange, their structural and functional variations may alter the water permeability and change the glymphatic flow. A previous study found that mice with genetic deletion of AQP4 (AQP4 KO) had larger interstitial spaces and higher brain water content, despite a similar CSF production rate and vascular density (Gomolka et al. 2023). Furthermore, the increased interstitial space was associated with a higher water diffusivity. These results suggested that AQP4 KO could result in a reduction in glymphatic flow and lead to stagnation of fluid in the interstitial space. Although this evidence is useful for understanding the modulation of glymphatic flow and for developing potential treatment methods, no study has investigated the effect of AQP4 SNPs on glymphatic function in humans, which could be mild compared to the extreme gene knock-out approaches.\nThe AQP4 is encoded by a 3 kb gene located on chromosome 18. Depending on the selection of two transcription starting sites, it can be translated into AQP4-M1 or AQP4-M23 isoforms, which differ in structural characteristics and their ability to form orthogonal arrays of particles, thereby affecting the water permeability of AQP4 (Nagelhus and Ottersen 2013;Smith et al. 2014). The rs72878794 is located in the promoter region upstream of exon 0 of the AQP4 gene (Figure 2). Its polymorphism may lead to differential expression of isoforms and subsequent downstream events (Zhang, Huang, et al. 2021;Zhang, Zhou, et al. 2021;Hook-Barnard and Hinton 2007). In the cortex of AD patients, a decrease in the M1-to-M23 isoform ratio was associated with changes in the localization of AQP4 (Zeppenfeld et al. 2017), but how they exactly influence AD pathology accumulation awaits further investigation. Chandra et al. (Chandra et al. 2021) found that AQP4 SNP rs72878794 minor allele carrier status was associated with decreased Florbetapir SUVRs, and they inferred that an altered glymphatic function might mediate the association. Here, we found that the AQP4 SNP rs72878794 minor allele carrier status was associated with a slower longitudinal increase in FW.\nConsistent with Chandras study, this result implies a protective role of rs72878794 minor allele carrier status.\nThe rs9951307 is located at the C-terminal end of AQP4, approximately 15 kb downstream of the AQP4 UGA canonical stop codon (Rainey- Smith et al. 2018), in a region that lacks known transcription factor-binding sites. Burfeinds study (Burfeind et al. 2017), using a longitudinal aging cohort, found that rs9951307 minor allele carrier status was associated with a slower cognitive decline in subjects diagnosed with AD. However, we found that the rs9951307 minor allele",

However, there was no significant correlation between FW and amyloid accumulation, and we had not investigated the association between FW and tau due to a small sample size. It should be noted that ISF stagnation may influence the clearance of a wide range of metabolic wastes and poisonous proteins, and it may cause brain degeneration through other pathological mechanisms rather than amyloid accumulation. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanism.",

      "text": "We did not observe any associations between SNPs and PVS or ALPS. Although the three imaging markers are all related to the glymphatic system, they reflect different structural or functional properties, as discussed above. These properties are influenced by distinct pathological processes, such as arterial stiffness or venous collagenosis. As a result, the three markers may not exhibit simultaneous changes under a specific disease condition but instead display varied alteration patterns across different neurological diseases.\nThis study is subject to several limitations. First, we included only SNPs that are associated with AD, and thus, we cannot dismiss the potential impact of previously reported SNPs unrelated to AD on our results. Second, the sample size was relatively small for uncovering associations between genetic variations and clinical or imaging features due to the requirements for genetic data and multi-sequence imaging data. This limitation may explain the lack of significant findings regarding PVS and DTI-ALPS. Similarly, although AQP4 SNPs were associated with FW, and FW was associated with cognitive scores, we did not observe a mediation effect, possibly due to a small effect size. While ADNI is already the largest multi-center project focused on AD, a substantial portion of data has not yet been released. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to validate our findings. Third, the involvement of multiple research centers may contribute to variability in diffusion metrics. However, as the acquisition protocol of ADNI has been harmonized by a specialized imaging core and we have conducted multi-center harmonization, these differences should have been minimized. Lastly, although we used the three most widely used markers to represent glymphatic-related changes, the pathophysiological underpinnings of these markers are still undergoing validation. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the results.",

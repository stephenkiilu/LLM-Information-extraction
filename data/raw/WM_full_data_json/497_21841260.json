    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess metabolic, perfusion, and microstructural changes within the posterior cingulate area in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) using advanced MR techniques such as: spectroscopy (MRS), perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Thirty patients with AD (mean age 71.5 y, MMSE 18), 23 with aMCI (mean age 66 y, MMSE 27.4), and 15 age-matched normal controls (mean age 69 y, MMSE 29.5) underwent conventional MRI followed by MRS, PWI, and DTI on 1.5 Tesla MR unit. Several metabolite ratios (N-acetylaspartate NAAcreatine Cr, choline ChCr, myoinositol mICr, mINAA, mICho) as well as parameters of cerebral blood volume relative to cerebellum and fractional anisotropy were obtained in the posterior cingulate region. The above parameters were correlated with the results of neuropsychological tests. AD patients showed significant abnormalities in all evaluated parameters while subjects with aMCI showed only perfusion and diffusion changes in the posterior cingulate area. Only PWI and DTI measurements revealed significant differences among the three evaluated subject groups. DTI, PWI, and MRS results showed significant correlations with neuropsychological tests. DTI changes correlated with both PWI and MRS abnormalities. Of neuroimaging methods, DTI revealed the highest accuracy in diagnosis of AD and aMCI (0.95, 0.79) followed by PWI (0.87, 0.67) and MRS (0.82, 0.47), respectively. In conclusion, AD is a complex pathology regarding both grey and white matter. DTI seems to be the most useful imaging modality to distinguish between AD, aMCI, and control group, followed by PWI and MRS.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, while amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is regarded as the predementia state. Both pathologies are caused by degenerative process resulting in generalized atrophy, microscopic amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles formation 1. AD pathology involves both grey and white matter. In AD, neuropathological damage of grey matter begins in primary limbic areas, such as hippocampi, and spreads to associated limbic areas, such as posterior cingulate cortex, followed by the temporo-parietal, and finally frontal cortices 2. White matter damage in AD includes loss and degeneration of axons, demyelination, and loss of oligodendrocytes as well as reactive astrocytic hyperplasia 3,4 and mostly affects the posterior circuitry which consists of fibers connecting both hippocampi and posterior cinguli.\nIn recent years, a wide spectrum of neuroimaging studies has been used in patients with AD and MCI in order to assess in vivo structural and functional changes in those pathologies. The results of many PET and SPECT studies 5,6 as well as magnetic resonance techniques such as proton spectroscopy (H 1 MRS) 7,8, perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) 91011, or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 121314, indicate the posterior cingulate area to be the most severely affected region in dementia and predementia patients. Metabolic reduction in this area is believed to be able to predict cognitive decline in presymptomatic individuals, indicating that the pathologic process begins well before even mild dementia is recognized clinically 15. Those findings are not surprising since the posterior cingulate area is a part of limbic system with reciprocal connections with medial temporal lobe and hippocampal formation. The area of posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus due to functional connectivity with thalamus is called a thalamocortical portion of Papez circuit and is involved in learning and memory processes which are deteriorated in AD and MCI 16.\nAlthough there are a great number of reports on metabolic and perfusion changes within the grey matter as well as microscopic damage within the white matter fiber tracts in AD and MCI, they focus mostly on the diagnostic ability of a single imaging technique rather than on a comparison among several techniques.\nIn our study, we used MRS and PWI methods to assess cortical changes and DTI to evaluate white matter abnormalities within the posterior cingulate region.\nMRS is a widely used method for assessing cerebral biochemical structure by evaluation of different metabolite ratios reflecting molecular and cellular processes. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels correlate with neuronal and axonal density, myoinositol (mI) is thought to be a marker of gliosis, and choline (Cho) represents myelin content and reflects membrane turnover. In AD the levels of NAA and mI are consistently found to be lower and higher, respectively, while there are contradictory reports regarding Cho 7,8.\nPWI is a new MR technique that enables measurements of cerebral hemodynamics with the use of cerebral blood volume (CBV) parameter. The value of CBV correlates with vessel density and is found to be lower in AD and MCI patients 91011. Finally, DTI is a non-invasive technique of evaluation of white matter microstructural damage, even within the white matter regions appearing normal on structural MRI. DTI uses parameter of fractional anisotropy (FA) which is a marker of white matter fibers integrity and is decreased in patients with AD and MCI 121314.\nThe purpose of the study was to assess metabolic, perfusion, and microstructural changes within the posterior cingulate area in patients with AD and aMCI and to investigate whether there are temporal correlations among them. In order to evaluate clinical utility sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRS, PWI, and DTI in diagnosis of AD and aMCI were assessed. The results of the neuroimaging techniques were also correlated with the scores of neuropsychological tests.\nTo our knowledge this is the first report focusing on utility of three advanced MR techniques (MRS, PWI, and DTI) in diagnosis of AD and aMCI on the basis of their results from the posterior cingulate region.",

Subjects with AD and aMCI were outpatients referred from the Department of Psychiatry, and the control subjects were volunteers recruited from the families of the patients and the hospital crew. All AD patients fulfilled the DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD 17 and the diagnosis of aMCI was determined according to Petersens criteria 18,19. The exclusion criteria for all three subgroups were severe head injury, headache, street drug or oral steroid use, current alcohol abuse or dependence, and loss of 25 of weight in the past year. Subjects with cerebral vascular damage (especially white matter lesions involving fibers of interest) or vascular risk factors were also excluded from the study. The additional exclusion criterium for the control group was any history of major psychiatric or central nervous system illness.\nAll subjects underwent detailed psychiatric examination, as well as laboratory and neuropsychological tests including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) adjusted for age and education level, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Clock Drawing Test, Dem-Tect, and Global Scale of Depression (GSD). The distribution of age, gender, MMSE, and CDR scores for each group are presented in Table 1.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the University Ethics Committee for conducting research involving humans.

Ten seconds after the start of image acquisition a bolus of a 1.0 moll gadobutrol formula (Gadovist, Schering, Berlin, Germany) in a dose of 0.3 mlkg of body weight was injected via 20-gauge catheter placed in the antecubital vein. Contrast administration was performed using an automatic injector (Medrad) at a rate of 5 mls and was followed by a saline bolus (20 ml at 5 mls). The whole perfusion imaging lasted 1 min 26 s in which sets of images from 13 axial slices were obtained before, during, and after contrast injection. The dynamic images were postprocessed using Functool software (GE, ADW 4.4). CBV maps were computed on a pixel-wise basis from the first-pass data as described by Belliveau et al. 22. Regional CBV values were obtained using single circular ROI (size CBV 525 mm 2 ) placed manually 24 cm above the AP-CP line within the posterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 2c). Since CBV values obtained with this methodology are not absolute measurements and require to be related to the reference standard, all CBV values from posterior cingulate cortex were normalized to the mean values in the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 2d) which is the region less affected in AD compared to other cortical measures 23.\nDuring the whole MR examination the subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "The aim of our study was to assess both the grey and white matter damage within the posterior cingulate region in AD and aMCI patients and to explore the relationship between those pathologies.\nIn our study in AD we detected several metabolic disturbances in the posterior cingulate cortex in MRS, which is consistent with the previous reports 7,8. We found lower NAACr and increased mINAA ratios with no detectable changes in mICr. Increased mINAA ratios in AD in our study were caused more by the severe NAA reductions than by an increase in mI, suggesting neuronal loss to be more evident in AD pathology than gliosis. We also did not find any abnormalities in ChoCr ratios in AD, though several MRS and neuropathological studies have reported a reduction of Cho levels and decrease in myelin content in the white matter. However, the majority of those changes were seen in frontoparietal rather than in the occipital regions 24, which was a region of interest in our study. Though metabolite abnormalities were previously reported in MCI patients 8, we did not detect any of them in our work. Our findings are in strong agreement with the recent study by Wang and colleagues who evaluated the posterior cingulate area using 3T MR unit and found no metabolite abnormalities in the MCI group compared to normal controls 7.\nIn our study, we also used perfusion techniques (PWI) to evaluate pathology of posterior cingulate grey matter. There are only a few reports on the use of DSC MRI in AD and even less in MCI pathology 91011. Posterior cingulate region was evaluated previously only in a single MR perfusion study by Cavallin et al., who did not find any hemodynamic deficits in this area in both AD and MCI patients 25. Those results do not parallel our findings of significant hypoperfusion of the posterior cingulate cortex in MCI and even more severe hypoperfusion of this area in AD patients. Moreover, in our previous study which was recently published 11, we had found that in AD and MCI patients hemodynamic deficits measured with DSC MRI were more pronounced in the posterior cingulate gyrus than in the temporo-parietal and frontal cortices or in hippocampi, which on the other hand stays in agreement with a large number of perfusion and metabolic studies using SPECT and PET 5,6.\nTo investigate white matter pathology, we used DTI which is a novel non-invasive MRI technique for in vivo mapping of brain microstructure particularly used for assessing white matter integrity 21,26,27. It is a quantitative technique that measures the movement of water within the different tissue compartments. Due to linear architecture of fiber bundles and presence of myelin sheaths, mobility of water within the normal white matter is restricted and preferentially oriented to the directions of the fibers. This is called anisotropic diffusion, in contrast to isotropic diffusion characteristic for cerebrospinal fluid in which mobility of water is unrestricted. The degree of anisotropy can be assessed using parameter of FA. FA is defined as a non-specific indicator of white matter integrity and its decrease is consistent with degradation or impairment of the white matter coherence due to microstructural pathology such as myelination defects 21,26,27. Since in dementia white matter pathology occurs at a microscopic level and thus is invisible on structural MRI, DTI seems to be a very promising technique 28.\nIn our study we found significant decreases of anisotropy in AD and aMCI patients compared to normal controls within the white matter bundles of the posterior cingulate region. This is in agreement with many previous DTI studies which showed posterior cingulum fibers to be the most affected association tracts in AD and MCI 12,13,29303132333435. In those studies the white matter damage was also detected in other association fibers such as superior and inferior longitudinal fascicles, inferior fronto-occipital fascicles, or commissural tracts (corpus callosum) but it was less severe than in the posterior cingulate bundles. In both AD and MCI, no FA changes were seen within projection bundles (posterior limbs of internal capsules and middle cerebellar peduncles) 36,37. There are two suggested explanations why association tracts and particularly posterior cingulum fibers are so strongly damaged in dementia. First, that white matter change in AD and MCI may be caused by the Wallerian degeneration of axons secondary to neuronal loss within association cortices 38, thus cingulum degeneration may result from atrophy of enthorhinal cortex which is characteristic for AD and MCI 5. To explain the pattern of white matter degradation, the so-called retrogenesis hypothesis may be adopted which assumes that degeneration follows a pattern that is the reverse of myelogenesis 39. According to this hypothesis, the late-myelinating fibers, such as those within association tracts including posterior cingulum fibers, are more susceptible to myelin breakdown than earlier myelinating fibers such as projection tracts.\nOur study revealed different patterns of functional changes within the posterior cingulate region in AD and aMCI patients. AD subjects showed more complex and advanced abnormalities compared to the aMCI group. In AD we noticed decrease of NAA and perfusion deficits within the grey matter as well as the white matter damage of cingulum fibers in the posterior cingulated region while in aMCI only abnormal results of PWI and DTI examinations were detected, with hypoperfusion and white matter damage being less severe than in AD and with no metabolite abnormalities found in MRS. These results indicate that white matter disintegrity and cortical hypoperfusion within the posterior cingulate region progress in the course of dementia (from aMCI to AD state) and appear as FA and rCBV disturbances well before metabolic changes are detectable in MRS. In dementia, spectroscopic measurements seem to be indirect markers of cerebral pathology, while DTI and PWI are methods enabling direct evaluation of brain abnormalities such as neuronal degeneration and hypoperfusion.\nCorrelations among the three MRI techniques revealed interesting associations between different pathologic processes in the brain which may also explain the pathophysiologic background of AD changes. In our study we found positive correlation between mean FA values and NAA levels within the posterior cingulate region, suggesting that the damage of cingulum fibers is strongly associated with the decreased number of neurons and axonal loss. It has to be stressed that this positive correlation between mean FA and NAA levels was found in both AD and aMCI patients. This finding may support the hypothe-sis of Wallerian degeneration rather than the retrograde hypothesis to be a cause of the white matter damage in the pathology of AD and predementia states. We did not find any correlations between FA values and the levels of mI that was reported by Ding et al., suggesting that the white matter damage may be associated with gliosis and neuroinflammatory processes 40. On the other hand, in our study rCBV values correlated strongly with almost all metabolite levels as well as with the DTI results. Those numerous correlations of rCBV values suggest the important role of hypoperfusion in different aspects of degeneration including neuronal loss, gliosis, or fiber tract damage. Those findings parallel a recent neurovascular hypothesis of neurodegeneration in AD which, in contrast to traditional neurocentric views on AD, indicates neurovascular dysfunction as a primary cause of degeneration processes. According to this new hypothesis, faulty blood-brain barrier clearance of amyloid-, aberrant angiogenesis, and arterial dysfunction may initiate neurovascular uncoupling, amyloid- accumulation, cerebrovascular regression, brain hypoperfusion, and neurovascular inflammation leading to chemical imbalance in the neuronal milieu, resulting in neuronal and synaptic dysfunction 414243.\nThe second major aim of our study was to evaluate clinical utility of MRS, PWI, and DTI techniques in assessing correct diagnoses and distinguishing between the different subject groups. Of three evaluated neuroimaging techniques, only PWI and DTI enabled differentiation between all the subject groups. MRS failed to differentiate the aMCI patients from the control group and showed the lowest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting AD and aMCI compared to PWI and DTI. DTI was found to be an imaging method with the highest accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, followed by PWI (Table 3). Our findings are very different from the results of Fayed and coworkers who aimed to assess the utility of several MR techniques in predicting conversion of MCI to AD 44. Of the three evaluated MR methods such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), PWI, and MRS, Fayed et al. found MRS to be the most useful technique with the highest accuracy values. In contrast to our study, Fayed et al. did not evaluate DTI which is a more advanced diffusion technique than DWI.\nThe analysis of redundancy showed that even though DTI appears to be the method with the highest accuracy in distinguishing both AD and aMCI, it was still not sufficient to discriminate all the patients with AD or aMCI and other techniques such as PWI and MRS were used for these purpose. These findings reflect the need for a multimodal approach in diagnosis of patients with dementia since the MR techniques seem to be complementary methods.\nFinally, correlation of MRS, PWI, and DTI measurements with the results of cognitive tests revealed significant correlation of NAACr ratio, rCBV, and FA values with MMSE and CDR, which is in agreement with the previous reports 45. Parameter of FA showed the strongest correlations with the neuropsychological test, followed by rCBV and NAACr levels (Table 4). Those findings demonstrate that pathology of the posterior cingulate region has a major impact on cognition of patients with dementia and that several pathological processes including neuronal loss, perfusion deficits, and white matter disintegrity contribute to cognitive decline. MRI measurements, especially FA values, may thus be used in objective assessment of the degree of dementia, as well as monitoring of the disease progression or therapeutic response.\nIn summary, the use of multimodal imaging approach is able to reveal significant biochemical, hemodynamic, and submicroscopic abnormalities within the posterior cingulate region in patients with AD and aMCI. DTI compared to other MR techniques such as MRS and PWI seems to be the method with the highest accuracy in distinguishing between healthy controls, aMCI, and AD. Magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive method may be a great tool for in vivo detailed evaluation of the complex pathology of AD. It has to be stressed though that the background of MRS, PWI, and DTI findings in dementia as well as their correlation with the gross pathology are not fully understood yet and further investigation is needed. The use of the new advanced MR techniques in diagnosis of other dementias than AD is also required and these studies are also being conducted in our institution.",

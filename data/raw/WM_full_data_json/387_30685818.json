    "abstract": "Patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) may exhibit a high risk of cognitive impairment (CI) by disruption of white matter (WM) integrity. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is recommended as a sensitive method to explore whole brain WM alterations at an asymptomatic stage of the disease, which might be correlated with underlying cognitive disorders. We aim to investigate alterations in WM microstructures and evaluate the relationships between the mean values of diffusion metrics (FA, MD, AD, and RD) and cognitive assessments in SIVD patients. Fifty SIVD patients with (SVCI, N  25) and without (pre-SVCI, N  25) cognitive impairments and normal controls (NC, N  23) underwent DTI and neuropsychological examinations. DTI data were analyzed via TBSS to detect significant changes in WM tracts. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between the mean values of diffusion indices and the cognitive assessments. In general, extensive symmetrically altered areas that involved approximately the entire cerebral WM were noted in the pre-SVCI group but were less distinct than that noted in the SVCI group compared with NCs. The genu of corpus callosum exhibited the most damaged WM fiber. Throughout WM, FA was decreased, whereas MD, AD, and RD were increased. Some specific WM tracts in patient groups were significantly correlated with the severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), cognitive assessments about executive functions and processing speed. WM integrity has already been damaged at the pre-SVCI stage, which would be associate with future cognitive dysfunction. DTI could potentially establish early biomarkers to detect underlying mechanisms of SIVD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is the most common type of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), which is characterized by white matter lesions (WMLs), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVSs), lacunar infarcts (LIs), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in subcortical structures (Benjamin et al. 2016;Wardlaw et al. 2013). The consequences of SIVD include gait decline (van der Holst et al. 2018), cerebral complications (Yew et al. 2017), and vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) especially with disorders in executive functions, attention, and mental processing speed (Lyoubi-Idrissi et al. 2017). Previous studies have revealed significant brain abnormalities in SIVD, including brain perfusion deficits in the temporal and frontal lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, and insula. These abnormalities are related to the degree of cognitive impairment (Sun et al. 2016), abnormal resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), orbitofrontal lobe (OFL), and the inferior frontal gyrus, which are mainly involved in executive and memory functions (Zhou et al. 2016) and disruption of rich club organizations with lower network strength and efficiency that are associated with lower scores on psychomotor speed and executive functions (Tuladhar et al. 2017). However, the pathomechanisms of cognition injury in SIVD seem to be most closely related to diffuse areas of WM damage with neuronal loss, demyelination, and gliosis (D Souza et al. 2018). Such damages are likely to reduce the efficiency of gray matter connections and disrupt communication pathways Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https:doi.org10.1007s12031-019-01266-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nbetween distinct brain regions, thus resulting in cognitive dysfunctions (Reijmer et al. 2016).\nOne promising technology to detect early WM alterations in SIVD is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Zeestraten et al. 2017). Early studies demonstrated that DTI was more sensitive than traditional methods to investigate WM microstructure and integrity (Nitkunan et al. 2008;Xu et al. 2010). Several studies have reported that both lacunes and diffuse WM damage detected in DTI are associated with cognitive impairment (Lawrence et al. 2013;Yuan et al. 2017). Thus, DTI could be applied as a sensitive method to explore the neural mechanism underlying cognitive impairment. To provide a comprehensive view of the patterns of change in WM and its relationship with cognitive functions, four main diffusion metrics, including the fractional anisotropy (FA), the mean diffusivity (MD), the axial diffusivity (AD), and the radial diffusivity (RD), are conjointly calculated to provide more information about reduced myelination and loss of axons (Amlien and Fjell 2014;Shu et al. 2011;Soares et al. 2013).\nRecent studies have demonstrated that patients with cognitive impairment exhibited decreased FA, increased MD, and different combination of changes in AD and RD of WM tracts especially located in thalamic-and caudate-prefrontal pathways, such as the corpus callosum (CC) and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), which are significantly related to the neuropsychological assessments of executive function and processing speed (Biesbroek et al. 2017). However, most studies mainly focus on patients with cognitive impairment (SVCI) or dementia (VaD) but neglect the asymptomatic stage of disease when individuals suffer vascular damage without cognitive impairments, which might represent a high-risk period of future cognition decline (pre-SVCI) (Sachdev et al. 2014).\nTract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is a reliable and optimized method with no bias and automation advantages (Smith et al. 2006) that can be used to comprehensively understand WM fiber damage across the entire brain. We investigated the extent of the changes in the microstructure of major WM tracts using TBSS and evaluated relationships between the diffusion metrics (FA, MD, AD, and RD) and cognitive disturbances in SIVD patients.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the current study, we evaluated WM alterations in SIVD patients with (SVCI) and without (pre-SVCI) cognitive impairment compared with the well-matched NC group using the TBSS method. The results demonstrated that patients with SIVD exhibit extensive areas of microstructural changes mostly in WM fibers, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and bilateral anterior thalamic radiation and corticospinal tract. Compared with the NCs, the pre-SVCI group exhibited widespread damage in whole brain WM skeletons, but the damage was less distinct compared with that noted in the SVCI group. The SIVD group exhibited significantly reduced FA and increased MD, AD, and RD in multiple WM regions. The genu of corpus callosum was the most affected WM tracts in the early stage of the disease. We also found that mean values of diffusion indices in some specific WM tracts in patient groups were significantly correlated with the burden of WMH and neuropsychological assessments that concerned executive functions. SIVD is a heterogeneous group of diseases that is characterized by extensive cerebral WM lesions and lacunar infarcts (Rosenberg et al. 2014). The pathologies of the disease could disrupt the global connection between cortical and subcortical networks, resulting in vascular cognitive impairment by damaging the intensity of the WM fibers, increasing the extracellular space and secondarily leading to atrophy of the gray cortex (Zeestraten et al. 2017). In the present study, we found that the WM microstructure was already impaired, mainly in cognitive and sensorimotor-related WM fibers at the early stage of SIVD. These findings were consistent with previous studies (Kim et al. 2015;Tuladhar et al. 2015). The underlying mechanisms of the disease may be related to the loss of myelin and axon damage from microvascular pathology (Joutel and Chabriat 2017), so we evaluated diffusion indices to explore the possible pathologic characteristics and revealed significantly reduced FA and increased MD in widespread WM tracts. Based on previous studies, FA represents the integrity of nerve fibers and has been used as an indicator reflecting WM tract damage (Wang et al. 2017), whereas MD represents a condition with reduced barriers to free water diffusion (Alves et al. 2015). The combination of reduced FA and increased MD may reflect the progressive loss of intensity of WM. We also found increased AD and RD in WM tracts, suggesting lesion-related axonal damage and demyelination contributing to WM impairment (Huang et al. 2018;Sun et al. 2018). The DTI-derived indices revealed more diffuse abnormalities of MD and RD compared with FA and AD (Fig. 2). Moreover, the mean MD values of the right SLF and left IFOF in the SVCI group were significantly correlated with WMH scores (shown in Supplement Table ), which is consistent with previous studies that concluded the MD was more sensitive for the progression of cerebral vascular disease compared with FA. MD and RD might serve as early markers of demyelination in WM regions (Hulst et al. 2013;van der Holst et al. 2018). The post hoc analysis demonstrated that the SVCI group exhibited more pronounced WM tissue disruption compared with the other two groups, which implied more serious axonal damage and myelin loss during disease progression. DTI approaches could be utilized as a remarkable method to detect early alterations of WM tracts at the prodromal stage of SIVD and additionally evaluate the severity of WM alterations.\nWe confirmed that specific WM tracts related to cognitive function were particularly vulnerable to SIVD. The mean values of diffusion indices in bilateral ILF and right SLF in the pre-SVCI group exhibited a significantly positive correlations with the cognitive assessments (R-DST, TMT-B, and stoop-1 test), which were considered acknowledgement tests to evaluate speed processing and executive functions (Ciulli et al. 2016;Palta et al. 2016). SLF and ILF are the major association fibers that connect frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices involved in executive functions and processing speed (Biesbroek et al. 2017). In the SVCI group, we also identified that the mean values of diffusion parameters in the bilateral ATR, a complex projection system that involves ascending fibers from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex and descending fibers from the fronto-parietal cortex to subcortical nuclei (Duering et al. 2013), were significantly negative related with the Stroop-1 test and CDT. Our results suggested that prefrontal-subcortical projections and long association tracts connecting strategic cognitive-related brain regions were susceptible to SIVD interruptions, and these findings are consistent with other relevant studies (Duering et al. 2014). The GCC exhibited WM tracts that were highly influenced at the early stage of SIVD. These results confirmed that cerebral vascular disease could lead to the loss of microstructure integrity of the GCC. These commissural fibers connecting the frontal lobe and other multiple cortical areas involved in attention and executive functions were ultimately impaired (Reginold et al. 2016). However, we observed no relationship between the mean valued of diffusion indices in GCC and cognitive assessments, which were inconsistent with the previous studies (Sun et al. 2018). This finding might be explained by the fact that we recruited some SIVD patients without cognitive impairments, and the early phase of the disease might only cause slight alterations in cognitive function. Other significant relationships between WM tracts and neuropsychological tests might be demonstrated by the fact that SIVD lesions impact WM fibers not only confined to some certain areas but along with the entire fiber skeleton.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the study included a relatively limited sample size and involved crosssectional research, which might lead to reduced sensitivity and accuracy of the results. Second, the severity of the disease in SIVD patients were rather mild, thus the underlying mechanism of the disease seems to be incompletely understood. In addition, some correlations between the WM tracts and cognitive assessments (shown in Supplement Table ) were not significant following Bonferroni multiple comparisons, indicating that these studies should only be considered an exploratory analysis. Future longitudinal follow-up studies with a larger scale and moderate-severe SIVD subjects are needed to provide comprehensive insight into the pathophysiology of the disease and statistical power. Third, WMH scores served as a covariate in the randomized analysis according to the Fazekas standard. Therefore, future studies with advanced methods, such as semiautomatic algorithm approaches, are recommended to strength the accuracy and reliability of our results.\nIn conclusion, this study indicated that SIVD patients exhibited extensive WM damage at the early stage of the disease, especially the GCC. Moreover, WM disruptions in bilateral ILF and right SLF of the pre-SVCI group and bilateral ATR of the SVCI group seemed to be closely related to cognitive assessments regarding executive functions and processing speed. Using TBSS analyses, we generated a global map of the WM changes in SIVD patients by measuring anisotropy and diffusivity alterations across the brain. DTI could be regarded as a sensitive tool for exploring the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in SIVD, especially during the early stage of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Although cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies revealed significant white matter changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the utility of this technique in predicting further cognitive decline is debated. Thirty-five healthy controls (HC) and 67 MCI subjects with DTI baseline data were neuropsychologically assessed at one year. Among them, there were 40 stable (sMCI; 9 single domain amnestic, 7 single domain frontal, 24 multiple domain) and 27 were progressive (pMCI; 7 single domain amnestic, 4 single domain frontal, 16 multiple domain). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and longitudinal, radial, and mean diffusivity were measured using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Statistics included group comparisons and individual classification of MCI cases using support vector machines (SVM). FA was significantly higher in HC compared to MCI in a distributed network including the ventral part of the corpus callosum, right temporal and frontal pathways. There were no significant group-level differences between sMCI versus pMCI or between MCI subtypes after correction for multiple comparisons. However, SVM analysis allowed for an individual classification with accuracies up to 91.4 (HC versus MCI) and 98.4 (sMCI versus pMCI). When considering the MCI subgroups separately, the minimum SVM classification accuracy for stable versus progressive cognitive decline was 97.5 in the multiple domain MCI group. SVM analysis of DTI data provided highly accurate individual classification of stable versus progressive MCI regardless of MCI subtype, indicating that this method may become an easily applicable tool for early individual detection of MCI subjects evolving to dementia.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Although there are currently no proven diseasemodifying treatments for Alzheimers disease (AD), several promising candidates are to date evaluated (for review, see 1,2). However, recent studies pointed to the limited performance of some of these curative strategies in patients with clinically overt dementia 3,4. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was originally conceived as a functionally non-disabling amnestic disorder that has been later on expanded to include essentially any form of cognitive complaint 5. The effect of an intervention on the conversion rate from MCI to AD has become a paradigm for assessing possible neurobiological modifiers early in the course of the disease. However, not all MCI evolve to AD or decline at identical rates and a significant proportion of cases remain stable for several years or even improve (for review, see 6). Based on this observation, several research groups attempted to identify structural neuroimaging markers that could predict at baseline the subsequent cognitive decline within this diagnostic category. The most common approach that has been taken up in previous investigations consisted on group comparisons of grey matter (GM) volumes based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in restricted cortical areas such as the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex (for review, see 7). As a complement to region of interest (ROI)based volumetry, several studies implemented either semi-manual volume segmentation (e.g., 8,9), or automatic voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 10 providing an analysis of the GM concentration across the entire brain (e.g., 111213141516). A series of VBM studies revealed volume differences between MCI and controls mainly distributed within the precuneus and cingulate gyrus (for review, see 17). More recently, multivariate models such as principal component analysis, structural equation modeling and support vector machine (SVM) 18 were used to provide individual risk scores for MCI conversion to AD on the basis of GM VBM data 17,19202122.\nDespite the fact that cortico-cortical disconnection is thought to be a main determinant of clinically overt dementia (for review, see 23), only a few studies explored the structural changes occurring in white matter (WM) in MCI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the interrogation of the microstructural integrity of white matter. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is estimated from DTI 24 and correlates with the integrity of white matter fiber bundles 25. Earlier studies on DTI FA in MCI can be sep-arated into three main categories: ROI-based 262728293031323334353637, voxel-based 38394041, and recently introduced Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), an improved voxelbased technique 424344. These contributions documented the presence of reduced FA primarily in white matter tracts with homogeneously oriented fibers (i.e., genu or splenium of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulus) and more rarely in frontal, parietal and temporal white matter. Overall, the pattern of white matter integrity disruption tends to follow an anterior to posterior gradient with greater damage noted in posterior regions in AD and MCI. However, other studies led to negative data challenging this point of view (for review, see 45).\nTo date and unlike the recent GM-focusing reports, there are no longitudinal studies addressing the utility of the DTI as an assessment tool for individual prediction of MCI rapid cognitive decline. We report here the results of a DTI-TBSS analysis in 35 HC and 67 MCI individuals who were neuropsychologically followedup after one year (2 drop-outs at follow-up). The present data reveal that the assessment of white matter tract changes at baseline provides a highly accurate discrimination between cases that remain cognitively stable (sMCI) and those which displayed progressive cognitive deficits at follow-up (pMCI).",

Both MCI and healthy controls (HC), with a high school degree or equivalent, were recruited in Geneva and Lausanne counties through advertisements in local newspapers. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity, and none reported a history of sustained head injury, or neurological or psychiatric disorders. All participants with regular use of psychotropics, stimulants and β-blockers as well as those with severe physical illness that precludes the participation in either phase of the project were excluded.\nAll individuals were first screened with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 46. The neuropsychological assessment included the MMSE orientation items, memory Digit Span Forward 47, Corsi Block-Tapping Test 48, Buschke double memory test 49, Shapes test 50, Verbal Fluency test 51,\nTrail Making test part B 52, Wisconsin Card Sort test (WCST, 53), Boston Naming test 54, tests of ideomotor 55, reflexive 56 and constructional praxis 57, and Ghent Overlapping Figure test 58. Attention was assessed with the WAIS-R, Code 59 and Trail Making Test part A 52. Global cognitive function was assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR, 60. Cases with CDR 0 and test scores compatible with the age appropriate mean in all tests were classified as HC (n  35, 26 women, mean age 63.7  5.1 years).\nSubjects with MMSE scores between 25 and 28 were considered as possible MCI cases. Subsequently, these cases underwent an additional clinical evaluation, which included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD, 61 and Lawtons Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL, 62). Depressive co-morbidity was excluded on the basis of a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score consistently equal or more than 8. All individuals having a test score more than 1.5 SD below the age and education level adjusted mean in any of the above tests and a CDR score of 0.5 but no dementia, were diagnosed as possible MCI 63. Among these cases, 16 The final sample included 67 MCI cases (38 women, mean age: 65.0  5.1 years), which underwent a detailed neuropsychological follow-up evaluation 1 year after inclusion using the same neuropsychological battery. Upon follow-up, subjects were considered to have progressed and were included in the pMCI group if: 1) they exhibited a significant deterioration (defined as 1.0 SD compared to inclusion values) in one memory test and at least one among the other neuropsychological tests; and 2) they showed clinically deterioration based on the review of all the neuropsychological tests by an independent physician highly experienced in cog-nitive disorders who was blinded to the scope of the study. Subjects were considered stable and included in the sMCI group if: 1) they exhibited no or marginal changes in their neuropsychological performances upon follow-up (test result improved or decreased  1.0 SD compared to inclusion values); and 2) they were considered to be clinically stable by the independent physician who reviewed the neuropsychological data.",

In principle, TBSS projects all subjects FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton using non-linear registration. The tract skeleton is the basis for voxel-wise crosssubject statistics and reduces potential misregistrations as the source for false-positive or false-negative analysis results. The other DTI derived parameters longitudinal (LD), radial (RD) and mean (MD) diffusivity were analyzed in the same way using spatial transfor-mation parameters that were estimated in the initial FA analysis. For MCI versus HC comparisons, we performed a voxel-wise statistical analysis with correction for multiple comparisons implementing threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) considering fully corrected p-values  0.05 as significant 69. We used the JHU ICBM white matter tractography atlas, which is distributed in the FSL package, for anatomic labeling of the supra-threshold voxels.

    "SVM individual classification analysis": {
      "text": "In order to obtain individual discrimination between HC and MCI and most importantly between sMCI and pMCI, we adopted a complex methodology including a processing chain of TBSS pre-processing of DTI FA data, feature selection of the most discriminative voxels, and subsequent SVM classification 17. The classification accuracy of over 98 for stable versus progressive MCI in our series implies that on average across the 10 repetitions of the 10 fold cross validation, only one subject was incorrectly classified regardless of MCI subgroup. In the present study, the performance of the SVM classification for the different MCI subgroups was assessed using two different methods. The first possibility is to train only one SVM classifier with all MCI subgroups, and assess the performance of this classifier for each MCI subgroup separately. In our data, only one sMCI subject (multiple domain) was falsely classified as pMCI. This led to classification accuracy of over 97 for multiple domain MCI and a nearly perfect classification for single domain amnestic and single domain frontal MCI. The second possibility is to use three separate SVM classifiers for the three different MCI subgroups. These results confirmed the extremely high accuracy values in multiple domain MCI subject (97.5) and nearly perfect classification of sin- Cluster index, number of supra-threshold voxels in cluster, maximum p-value, location of maximum p-value per cluster in MNI standard space (X, Y, Z) and centre of gravity of the cluster in NMI standard space (X, Y, Z).\ngle amnestic and single frontal cases. These separate SVM analyses for the MCI subgroups should however be considered with caution given the small sample sizes in particular for single domain amnestic and frontal MCI subgroups. With respect to future clinical applications, our data suggest that one SVM classifier may be sufficient to discriminate stable versus progressive cases even if the neuropsychological profile of MCI subgroups is unknown at the time of SVM analysis.\nTwo previous studies successfully applied a SVM classifier to discriminate AD versus HC, with accuracies of 89 19 and 94.5 22. More relevant in the context of the present investigation are three recent contributions that classified stable versus progressive MCI with accuracies of 75 17, 81.5 21, and 85 20. Unlike the present investigation that assessed WM tract changes, all of these studies were based on VBM 10 analyses of grey matter (GM) con- Note that the accuracy is calculated as average accuracy of 10 repetitions using 10 fold cross validation. For technical reasons, the sensitivity and specificity values are calculated on the basis of single repetitions using 10 fold cross validation. The different rows represent the number of features that were selected using a Relief feature selection procedure (also using 10 fold cross validation). The optimum number of features is highlighted with Bold characters. The highest accuracy for HC versus MCI was 91.36 using 500 features (voxels). The highest accuracy for sMCI versus pMCI was 98.38 using 750 features (voxels).\ncentration derived from T1w images. In comparison to these data, our WM-based classification accuracies tend to be slightly higher based on the DTI FA data. This suggests that the disruption of axonal integrity might be a key determinant of subsequent cognitive decline in MCI. Supporting this possibility, two recent investigations in spinocerebellar ataxia and Friedreich ataxia 82,83 showed a higher sensitivity of DTI TBSS compared to GM VBM in the early stages of the degenerative process. Similarly, a recent study assessing GM VBM and WM TBSS in early primary progressive multiple sclerosis pointed to the need of longitudinal studies to determine whether the GM atrophy precedes or follows the WM damage 84. The presented SVM analysis of DTI TBSS data is not intended to replace, but to complement the previous classification studies, including SVM studies on GM VBM data. Future work is needed to develop methods to combine GM VBM and WM DTI analyses to obtain higher accuracy rates and more robust classification results. At first glance, it might appear counterintuitive that the SVM individual classification was very successful in discriminating stable versus progressive MCI despite the absence of TFCE corrected supra-threshold differences for the corresponding TBSS group comparison. This can however be readily explained by the major conceptual differences of these techniques. For the group comparison, a t-value is computed for each voxel that is subsequently corrected to take into account the multiple comparisons of over 150000 voxels. Increasing the number of considered voxels augments the effect of multiple comparison correction. In the individual SVM analysis, the most discriminative voxels are selected using a feature selection algorithm. The number of additional, not selected voxels is thus irrelevant in this context. Moreover, the SVM analysis results in a single parameter per subject taking into account all included voxels without multiple comparison biases. Finally, the higher classification accuracy for the comparison of sMCI versus pMCI in relation to comparison of HC versus MCI can be explained by the more homogeneous group composition for the first comparison (considering only sMCI or pMCI). Combining all MCI subjects for the second comparison of HC versus MCI results in a more heterogeneous MCI group. The more homogeneous the group composition, the better the SVM classifier can differentiate between groups.",

      "text": "Demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ at inclusion between groups (Table 1). Two MCI cases were lost upon follow-up, which took place one year after baseline assessment (range 1.03  0.17 years). The progressive MCI (pMCI) group consisted of twenty-seven (40.3) cases showing significant deterioration in MMSE (p  0.001), p  0.05), working memory (Digit Span Forward test, p  0.05) and episodic memory (Shapes Test p  0.05). This group included 7 single domain amnestic, 4 single domain frontal, and 16 multiple domain MCI cases. In seven among the pMCI cases, the clinical diagnosis of dementia was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. The remaining 40 cases (59.7) showed no significant changes in cognitive functions (stable MCI, sM-CI; 9 single domain amnestic, 7 single domain frontal, 24 multiple domain). The sMCI showed a significant improvement from inclusion to follow-up in executive functions (Verbal Fluency test and Trail Making test B, p  0.05), attention (Trail Making test A, p  0.05), episodic memory (Buschke double memory test, CR imm p  0.05 and CR tot p  0.005), probably related to re-test learning (Table 2).

There was no supra-threshold difference in LD, RD, or MD between HC and MCI cases. The inverse comparison of MCI versus HC also yielded no supra-threshold voxels (see Fig. 1, Table 3). The FA between HC and MCI cases persisted when adjusting for age and gender. No additional structures with significant group differences were identified in these multivariate models.

There were no significant differences in Fazekas scores between groups (HC 0.97  0.82, sMCI 0.95  0.78, pMCI 1.18  0.88).

      "text": "Consistent with previous studies, the present findings indicate that white matter track changes are widely present in the brain of MCI individuals and affect both homogeneously distributed fibers within the corpus callosum and longitudinal fasciculus as well as axons in the parahippocampal white matter known to be particularly vulnerable in the course of the neurodegenerative process. Most importantly, they reveal that the automatic assessment of white matter integrity using DTI-TBSS provide a highly accurate tool for the prediction of rapid cognitive deterioration in MCI. We were able to discriminate sMCI from pMCI with a 98 accuracy that was even higher to that found for the distinction between HC and MCI (91).",

    "TBSS group analysis": {
      "text": "Overall, the regional distribution of decreased FA observed confirms the vulnerability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric corticocortical connections in MCI as already described by Lee and collaborators 41. As in most recent ROI and voxel-based DTI studies, white matter tracts with homogeneously oriented fibers in the ventral part of corpus callosum display a significant decrease of FA in MCI compared to HC cases 33,34,36,37,74,75. This area concentrates the main interhemispheric long association fibers that originate primarily from large pyramidal neurons known to be prone to NFT formation (for review see 23). Interestingly, our data show that among fibers with intermediate anisotropy, temporal and frontal white matter pathways, i.e., the right uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculi involved in memory performances 76 display the more pronounced loss of FA in MCI cases 77. To date, only three TBSS studies attempted to explore DTI patterns in limited series of MCI cases 424344. The study by Damoiseaux et al. (2009) focused on AD cases and included only 8 MCI cases without definite conclusions. Liu and collaborators (2009) analyzed 27 MCI cases and detected significant FA decreases in the same corticocortical circuits. As some previous ROI and voxel-based studies, these authors reported additional FA decreases in the parahippocampal white matter and cingulum 27,31,32,38,75. An FA decrease in these areas was also found for suprathreshold voxels in our larger MCI series, yet it was less pronounced than that of the ventral part of the corpus callosum and front-temporal WM pathways.\nIn agreement with the recent study of Bosch and colleagues (2010), our data indicate that FA is a more sensitive DTI parameter than LD, RD, or MD for the distinction between MCI and HC cases. Another recent TBSS study assessing the same diffusion parameters Fig. 1. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis between healthy controls (HC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). HC subjects had significantly higher FA in a distributed network, most pronounced in the ventral part of the corpus callosum and the right temporal and frontal WM pathways in the parahippocampal white matterincluding the inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi (red-yellow indicates level of signifinance). The inverse comparison of MCI versus HC yielded no supra-threshold differences.

Grey: mean FA value, green: average skeleton, red: HCMCI Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) corrected for multiple comparisons at p  0.05. Supra-threshold voxels were enlarged using TBSS fill (part of FSL) for illustrative purposes.\nin clinically overt AD cases compared to HC led to opposite results 78. The few available recent investigations on the different diffusion parameters in normal aging, MCI and AD 44,78798081 demonstrated regional differences in the distribution of significant changes in the different diffusion parameters FA, LD, RD, and MD. These available studies are partly controversial. For example in a study of MCI and AD subjects FA was closer related to the cognitive profile than LD or RD. In contrast, another study in AD showed stronger differences in LD, RD and MD as compared to FA, suggesting that FA is the least sensitive diffusion parameter 78. This discordance implies that the sensitivity of the different diffusion parameters may vary substantially as a function of the disease severity. Research using these different diffusion indices is still at an early stage, as is our understanding of the relevance of LD and RD changes in terms of myelin or axonal damage. For example, wallerian degeneration suggested by increased mean diffusivity without significant changes in FA may take place only in advanced stages of the degenerative process. Future work is needed to determine the evolution of changes of these different diffusion parameters in aging, MCI and AD, and to improve our understanding how axonal and myelin changes are related to possibly specific patterns of these different diffusion parameters.",

First, in order to preserve statistical power, we did not perform separate analyses of our TBSS DTI data according to MCI subtypes. We cannot thus exclude that the patterns of TBSS comparisons between HC and MCI may be different in single domain amnestic, single domain frontal and multiple domain MCI 32,75. Second, the best classification data were obtained with nonlinear (RBF-kernel) SVM that does not provide an easy to interpret weight vector to identify the most discriminative brain areas. Third, the very high accuracy rates of individual classification exceeded our expectations. These values were obtained by a well established ten-fold cross validation where nine parts are used for training and the remaining part is used for testing the classifier 17. Even though this cross validation approach is a standard method in the field of machine learningmulti voxel pattern analysis and appropriate for the number of subjects of our study, the present results seem to be too optimistic, probably related to some degree of over-fitting of the data. Additional validation in larger independent datasets, which should be ideally acquired on different MR scanners, is warranted to confirm the present findings.",

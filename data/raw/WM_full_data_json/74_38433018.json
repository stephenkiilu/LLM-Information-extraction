    "abstract": "Background: Astrogliosis and white matter lesions (WML) are key characteristics of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying VCID remain poorly understood. Stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport 1 (NKCC1) and its upstream kinases WNK (with no lysine) and SPAK (the STE20SPS1-related prolinealanine-rich kinase) play a role in astrocytic intracellular Na  overload, hypertrophy, and swelling. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the effect of SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a on pathogenesis and cognitive function in a mouse model of VCID induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). Methods: Following sham or BCAS surgery, mice were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle (DMSO) or SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a treatment regimen (days 14-35 postsurgery). Mice were then evaluated for cognitive functions by Morris water maze, WML by ex vivo MRI-DTI analysis, and astrogliosisdemyelination by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting.

      "text": "Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are currently considered as one of the leading causes of dementing illness in the world and are emerging as a major public health problem in many countries. 1,2 Since there are no approved drugs for VCID treatment, the development of effective therapy is urgently required. Reactive astrogliosis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and white matter lesion (WML) represent the pathological hallmark of VCID. 345 The most common feature of clinical VCID is diffuse WML, detected as areas of hyperintensity on T2weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. 2,6,7 Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), resulting from either small vessel disease or critical arterial stenosis (carotid artery atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), causes oligodendrocyte (OL) death, WML, and subsequent cognitive impairment. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which reactive astrogliosis and WML occur are not well understood.\nEvolutionary conserved WNK (with no lysine K) kinases, along with the downstream SPAKOSR1 (Ste20SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase and oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) kinases, regulate activities of multiple-ion transporters and channels via protein phosphorylation. 8,9 One of the major targets of WNK and SPAK OSR1 is Na  -K  -2Cl -cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), 10 which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple brain disorders. 11 Interestingly, studies from our laboratory and others found that NKCC1 activity causes astrocytic intracellular Na  overload, hypertrophy, and swelling and leads to astrogliosis after in vitro and in vivo ischemia or ammonia-induced toxicity. 12131415 This highlights NKCC1 protein as a potential therapeutic target for various CNS diseases associated with reactive astrogliosis, including VCID. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the involvement of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade in bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)-induced reactive astrogliosis and WML. We also investigated the effect of the non-ATP competitive specific inhibitor of SPAK kinase ZT-1a in mitigating SPAK-NKCC1-mediated reactive astrogliosis, OL death, and memory impairment in a mouse BCAS model. Here, we report that CCH triggered stimulation of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade in white matter astrocytes and led to reactive astrogliosis and demyelination. Most importantly, post-BCAS administration of ZT-1a effectively attenuated VCID pathologies and significantly improved learning and memory function in BCAS mice.",

Through a midline incision, both common carotid arteries (CCA) were carefully exposed and isolated from the vagus nerves and surrounding tissues. A blunt 30-gauge needle (diameter 0.31 mm) was placed on the right CCA (Figure 1A). The artery was doubly ligated with 7-0 silk suture and the needle was gently removed.

Therefore, we focused our investigation on the association between NKCC1 activity and white matterreactive astrogliosis as well as WML in the CC and external capsule and GFAP protein expression in the CC exhibited a significant correlation, with a Pearsons correlation coefficient of r  0.84 (p  0.001) (Figure S1).

However, we did not find any colocalization of NKCC1 with microgliamacrophages marker Iba1 or the oligodendrocytes marker Olig2 (Figure 2D). In the hippocampal CA1 region, we observed a modest increase in tNKCC1 protein expression, which was mostly colocalized with GFAP  astrocytes but not with NeuN  neurons or Iba1  microgliamacrophages (Figure 2E). Collectively these findings confirm that BCAS upregulates tNKCC1 protein expression in GFAP  -reactive astrocytes in the white matter and some in the hippocampal region.

In contrast, the ZT-1a-treated mice exhibited better preservation of CC and EC tract integrity in both hemispheres (arrows).

Figure 4D revealed a massive loss of MBP protein expression in the CC and EC tracts of Veh-treated BCAS brains compared to sham control group, which is consistent with the immunoblotting findings where MBP was robustly decreased in the white matter region (CC  STR) of BCAS brains compared to sham control (Figure 3A). Conversely, the ZT-1a-treated brains exhibited significantly less MBP loss (p  0.05, Figure 4D).

Although the functions of reactive astrocytes have been a subject of debate, growing evidence suggests that C3d  -reactive astrocytes are toxic to cortical neurons, embryonic spinal motor neurons, and mature, differentiated oligodendrocytes in cell culture and mouse brain. 29,30 However, the mechanism by which reactive astrocytes induce cell death in brain cells remains unclear. In this study, we observed reactive astrogliosis in corpus callosum, external capsule, and striatum regions at 2-5 weeks after BCAS surgery. Importantly, an upregulation of NKCC1 protein was detected in white matter tracts which were colocalized with GFAP reactive astrocytes. Moreover, increased phosphorylated and total SPAK protein, and total WNK124 protein were concurrently detected in white matter (striatum and CC) tissues in the BCAS mouse brains. Therefore, we speculated that CCH-mediated activation of WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade contributes to reactive astrogliosis, inflammation, and subsequent demyelination and cognitive impairment, and inhibition of SPAK-NKCC1 complex would prevent reactive astrogliosis, demyelination, and cognitive impairment.\nReactive astrocytes are also able to slow and impair the differentiation of OPC into OL in vitro and in vivo 29,31 and induce caspase-3dependent apoptotic cell death in neurons and OL. 29 Similarly, in this study, we detected a substantial increase in C3d  GFAP  cytotoxic Most importantly, SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a attenuated transformation of quiescent astrocytes into cytotoxic reactive astrocytes and increased the number of S100A10  GFAP  homeostatic astrocytes in the white matter tracts of mouse brains following BCAS. These results support the notion that C3d  -reactive astrocytes play a detrimental role in BCAS-induced demyelination, possibly by killing APC  mature OL and NG  OPC and inhibiting differentiation and maturation of OPC into OL. Indeed, a recent study showed an association between impaired OL maturation and increased C3d  cytotoxic reactive astrocytes in a mouse BCAS model, 31 further supporting our hypothesis. However, the specific toxic molecule(s) secreted by cytotoxic reactive astrocytes that induce OPCOL death and inhibit OPC proliferation and differentiation are yet to be identified. 29 Interestingly, a recent study reported that the leukemia inhibitory F I G U R E 6 SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a inhibits expressions of tNKCC1, pNKCC1, and GFAP, and prevents MBP loss in the corpus callosum (CC) after BCAS. (A, B) ZT-1a treatment prevents BCAS-induced increased expression of GFAP and loss of MBP in mouse brain 5 weeks after BCAS. Data are mean  SEM; one-way ANOVA, Tukeys post hoc test; n  3-4; p  0.05, p  0.01. (C-F) ZT-1a-treated mice exhibit decreased expressions of NKCC1 and GFAP proteins in GFAP  astrocytes in CC compared to Veh-treated mice at 5 weeks after BCAS. Data are mean  SEM; one-way ANOVA, Tukeys post hoc test; n  3-4; p  0.01. factor (LIF) secreted from GFAP  astrocytes plays a protective role against BCAS-induced memory impairment in WT C57BL6J mice during early stage of VCID. 37 Kakae et al. (2023) showed that astrocytic LIF enhanced differentiation of myelinating OL at 2 weeks after BCAS but not at 4 weeks after BCAS. 37 In our study, we found increased myelinating OL in ZT-1a-treated BCAS mice at 4 weeks after BCAS. Whether ZT-1a treatment affects astrocyte LIF secretion warrants further study.\nSystemic administration of the specific SPAK inhibitor, ZT-1a, in mice significantly reduced NKCC1 protein expression and phosphorylation in white matter astrocytes, resulting in attenuated gliosis, demyelination, and improved cognitive function in BCAS mice. Our results are consistent with a prior study 38 in which inhibiting NKCC1 with bumetanide attenuated CCH-induced WML and cognitive impairment, suggesting the SPAK-NKCC1 complex as a potential therapeutic target for VCID. Although we observed a robust efficacy of ZT-1a during the early stage of VCID (2-5 weeks post-BCAS), we did not investigate BCAS-induced pathophysiological changes at delayed time points, or did we assess the efficacy of ZT-1a at advanced stages. Therefore, further study is required to assess the effects of ZT-1a during the advanced stage of VCID and to establish the optimal doses of ZT-1a. It is important to note that SPAK and NKCC1 proteins are widely expressed in the CNS both in glia and neurons, 39 and play an important role in the synaptic transmission, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier integrity, inflammation, as well as brain injury. 404142 BCAS-induced memory impairment is not only associated with WML but also hippocampal neurodegeneration. 43 However, in this needle-gauged BCAS model, we did not observe a significant neuronal death in the hippocampus at 5 weeks after BCAS (Figure S6), suggesting that BCAS-induced memory impairment observed in our study was not associated with hippocampal neurodegeneration, at least, at the early stage of VCID (4-5 weeks post-BCAS). Our results are consistent with previous reports that BCAS-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration is a delayed phenomenon. 44,45 However, we cannot exclude any potential effect of ZT-1a on other types of brain cells, including microglia and endothelial cells, which are integral components of the neurovascular unit and can influence astrocytic swelling and ischemic injury. 46 Taken together, better drug-like properties of ZT-1a including specificity for SPAK kinase, CNS permeability, 20 and robust efficacy in mouse BCAS model reveal the therapeutic potential of ZT-1a for the treatment of VCID.\nNKCC1 phosphorylation and activity are regulated by upstream WNK and SPAKOSR1 kinases. In this study, we observed significant upregulation of total WNK (1, 2, and 4), SPAK, and NKCC1 protein expression in mostly white matter and HP at 4 weeks after BCAS. Upregulation of tNKCC1 protein primarily localized within GFAP  -reactive astrocytes in the white matter tracts.\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms of how WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade proteins are upregulated in astrocytes remain unknown.\nIn our previous study, 21 through bioinformatics and ChIP-qPCR assays, we identified that human and mouse Wnk124, Spak, and Nkcc1 gene promoters contain multiple NF-κB-binding sites (5-GGGRNY Y YCC-3). We also found that ischemia-induced NF-κB activity regulates transcriptional upregulation of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 complex genes in ischemic stroke mouse brains. 21 Therefore, it is plausible that the upregulation of WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade proteins in BCAS mouse brains is a result of increased NF-κB recruitment on Wnk1, Wnk2, Wnk4, Spak, and Nkcc1 gene promoters which remains to be elucidated in future studies. In fact, NF-κB activation has been found to be involved in BCAS-induced astrogliosis and selective inhibition of astrocytic NF-κB activity in Gfap-IkBαdn mice (expressing a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB) attenuated white matter astrogliosis after BCAS 47 and supports our hypothesis.\nConsistent with our previous study, 21 we found that ZT-1a treatment not only reduced BCAS-induced phosphorylation of NKCC1 protein but also decreased the expression of total NKCC1 protein in the current study. Whether ZT-1a affects Nkcc1 transcription or NKCC1 protein translation is not known. A likely mechanism could be that ZT-1a reduced brain inflammation which in turn resulted in reduced NK-κB-mediated Nkcc1 transcription. SPAK kinase regulates immune responses in many inflammatory disorders including ischemiareperfusion injury, 48 inflammatory bowel disease, 49 and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. 27 Using multi-omic approach, recently Robert et al. 50 demonstrated that SPAK kinase acts as both transducer of pro-inflammatory cytokine toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals and regulators of multiple-ion transporters including NKCC1 in neuroinflammatory disorders. Therefore, it is possible that inhibition of SPAK activity by ZT-1a checks TLR4NF-κB inflammatory cascade, potentially contributing to the reduced expression of Nkcc1 in mouse brain.",

      "text": "In this study, we present evidence that BCAS-induced CCH stimulates the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 cascade in the brain, which is, at least in part, responsible for reactive astrogliosis, OL death, WML, and memory impairments. Most importantly, post-BCAS administration of ZT-1a in mice dampens reactive astrogliosis, OL death, and WML and improves learning and memory function. These findings revealed the potential of pharmacological blockade of the SPAK-NKCC1 complex in reducing CCH-induced WML and cognitive impairment and underscored the therapeutic potential of ZT-1a in ameliorating the detrimental effects of cytotoxic reactive astrocytes in VCID and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

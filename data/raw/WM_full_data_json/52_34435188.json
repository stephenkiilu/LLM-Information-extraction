    "abstract": "The recognition, diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injuries are difficult and confusing. It is unclear how the severity and number of injuries sustained relate to brain injuries, such as diffuse axonal injury, diffuse vascular injury and progressive neurodegeneration. Advances in neuroimaging techniques enable the investigation of neuropathologies associated with acute and long-term effects of injury. Head injuries are the most commonly reported injury seen during professional rugby. There is increased vigilance for the immediate effects of these injuries in matches, but there has been surprisingly little research investigating the longer-term effects of rugby participation. Here, we present a longitudinal observational study investigating the relationship of exposure to rugby participation and sub-acute head injuries in professional adult male and female rugby union and league players using advanced MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging and susceptibility weighted imaging was used to assess white matter structure and evidence of axonal and diffuse vascular injury. We also studied changes in brain structure over time using Jacobian Determinant statistics extracted from serial volumetric imaging. We tested 41 male and 3 female adult elite rugby players, of whom 21 attended study visits after a head injury, alongside 32 non-sporting controls, 15 non-collision-sport athletic controls and 16 longitudinally assessed controls. Eighteen rugby players participated in the longitudinal arm of the study, with a second visit at least 6 months after their first scan. Neuroimaging evidence of either axonal injury or diffuse vascular injury was present in 23 (1044) of players. In the non-acutely injured group of rugby players, abnormalities of fractional anisotropy and other diffusion measures were seen. In contrast, non-collision-sport athletic controls were not classified as showing abnormalities. A group level contrast also showed evidence of sub-acute injury using diffusion tensor imaging in rugby players. Examination of longitudinal imaging revealed unexpected reductions in white matter volume in the elite rugby players studied. These changes were not related to self-reported head injury history or neuropsychological test scores and might indicate excess neurodegeneration in white matter tracts affected by injury. Taken together, our findings suggest an association of participation in elite adult rugby with changes in brain structure. Further well-designed large-scale studies are needed to understand the impact of both repeated sports-related head impacts and head injuries on brain structure, and to clarify whether the abnormalities we have observed are related to an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease and impaired neurocognitive function following elite rugby participation.",

      "text": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are common, with a global incidence of 45-54 million per year. 1 Sport-related mTBIs account for 15-20 of these injuries requiring treatment in the USA. 2,3 They are often considered relatively harmless. However, symptoms can persist after injuries that appear relatively trivial 456 and animal models show persistent brain injury after mTBI. 7 Some types of neuropathology, such as diffuse axonal injury (DAI), are under-Graphical Abstract recognised by conventional diagnostic imaging and repeated mTBI has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). 891011 Hence, detailed investigation of the long-term effects of repeated sports mTBI on brain health is important.\nRugby is a high-intensity collision team sport played in over 120 countries by over 9 million people 12 and is split into Rugby Union and Rugby League. In professional rugby union in the UK, mTBI is the most common reported match injury (20 of injuries) with an incidence of 20.4 per 1000 h. 13 In Australia, the rate of mTBI in the National Rugby League (NRL) was estimated to be 14.8 per 1000 player match hours. 14 Despite relatively high rates of head injury and an increasing focus on prevention in the form of law variations 15 and player preparation, 16 there has been relatively little research investigating the long-term effects of rugby participation. Previous work in retired rugby players has found evidence of a limited effect of higher self-reported rates of depression and mild cognitive impairment compared to controls. 171819 However, rates of dementia in the retired rugby player population are not necessarily different from control levels. 20 CTE has recently been reported in a small number of ex-players: two in rugby league 21 and four in rugby union. 22,23 Therefore, further research is needed to understand whether exposure to rugby participation and head injuries experienced during a rugby career are sufficient to lead to lasting brain injury.\nNeuroimaging is key to the investigation of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Standard CT and MRI often appear normal after mTBI. 5 However, white matter injuries can be more sensitively identified using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, such as diffusion MRI and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). 242526 DAI causes many of the long-term effects of TBI. It can be sensitively identified by diffusion MRI. Abnormalities in the directionality of water diffusion, most commonly quantified using changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), provide information about the location and severity of DAI. White matter FA increases acutely and subsequently reduces in the presence of longer-term damage. 272829 FA and other diffusion metrics provide: (i) a validated measure of white matter integrity after TBI in animals models of TBI e.g. Mac Donald et al. 30 ; (ii) increased sensitivity to DAI compared to conventional MRI 24 ; and (iii) information that helps predict long-term clinical outcome after TBI, 31 including the type of post-traumatic problems that develop. 26,323334 Diffusion abnormalities have been demonstrated in a range of sporting mTBI types, however, the direction of change is inconsistent. In mixed sport cohorts, ice hockey players and American Footballers, FA has been shown to increase acutely after a sports mTBI. 35363738 This elevation has been attributed to increased anisotropy caused by cerebral oedema. 27,39 In several studies, these changes persist in the chronic stage, 37,40,41 particularly in cohorts of younger athletes. In others, including studies of boxers, FA is observed to be decreased relative to controls in the chronic stages after a sports mTBI, 42434445 similar to changes observed in non-sport mTBI and moderate-severe TBI. Several studies do not find abnormalities in FA as a result of sports mTBI. 46474849 Few studies investigate solely a population of rugby players with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In 73 non-injured female varsity 50 and 11 retired rugby league players, 51 evidence of reduced FA as well as elevated diffusivity was observed in both studies.\nSWI provides additional information about the presence of diffuse vascular injury (DVI). 52 Gross intracerebral haemorrhage identifiable on CT is relatively uncommon following sports mTBI. However, more subtle DVI can occur and may be missed on conventional imaging. DVI produces small peri-venular haemorrhages that are seen as petechial microhaemorrhages on SWI. Post-traumatic microhaemorrhages are associated with more cognitive impairment and worse clinical outcomes. 53,54 However, studies utilizing SWI in a sporting context are very limited. The majority of studies in boxing, ice hockey and American Football have found little to no evidence of abnormal microhaemorrhage prevalence in athletes. 55565758 Currently, there exist no studies of rugby players using SWI.\nIn addition to the acute effects of sport mTBI, repeated head impacts can lead to progressive neurodegeneration. 7,10,59 Therefore, an important question is to what extent different sports accelerate neurodegeneration and increase the risk of dementia. Most recent research has focussed on sports, such as American Football and boxing, where the long-term risks of CTE and other types of dementia have been clearly demonstrated. 10,11,22,60 The neurodegenerative risks of other sports are less clear and the prevalence of sports related dementia is generally uncertain as is the dose of head injury exposure needed to accelerate neurodegeneration. Recent work has demonstrated a surprisingly large increase in the risk of dementia, in particular Alzheimers disease, in deceased association football players. 61 In rugby, CTE pathology has been reported in small case studies of ex-rugby players, 22,23 but the prevalence and consequences of neurodegenerative pathology in rugby players are unclear.\nThe presence of neurodegeneration can be studied using serial MRI. Brain atrophy is a common end-point of various types of neurodegeneration. This is routinely used in the assessment of dementia and can be sensitively measured using longitudinal brain scanning. Serial structural imaging can be used to generate metrics of volume change over time, such as the Jacobian Determinant (JD). 62 White matter volume changes are highly dependent on age. Volumes increase in children and young adults, before declining in older age. 63,64 The normal development and ageing of the white matter can be affected by TBI. Atrophy is increased after single moderate-severe TBI, 65 is more prominent in the depths of sulci where CTE pathology occurs 66 and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. 67686970 In other neurodegenerative diseases, atrophy measured by MRI has been histologically validated at post-mortem. 71 Hence, serial MRI provides a method of sensitively assessing whether neurodegeneration is taking place and mapping its spatial pattern, which may give an indication of the underlying pathological process.\nHere, we report a longitudinal observational study of 41 male and 3 female elite rugby union and league players using repeated diffusion, susceptibility weighted and volumetric MRI to measure DAI, DVI and brain atrophy, respectively. We test the hypotheses that participation in elite rugby will be associated with: (i) evidence of DAI measured by diffusion MRI; (ii) evidence of DVI measured by SWI; and (iii) evidence of abnormal white matter tract development andor increased brain atrophy, measured by longitudinal changes in brain volume. To investigate the acute and long-term impact of rugby participation, players were recruited with or without a recent history of mTBI. Players were compared against sporting and non-sporting controls to investigate whether imaging abnormalities were associated with participation in high intensity sporting activity.",

Twentyone players were assessed shortly after a mild TBI that was sustained whilst playing professional rugby. On average these players were 4.7 days post-injury. Subacutely injured players presented with a mean symptom severity score of 10.3 on the SCAT-5 during their pitch side assessment at the time of injury and had an average return to play duration of 7.2 days (Supplementary Table 1). Demographic and physical characteristics were well matched between sub-acutely injured and non-acutely injured rugby players. Eighteen rugby players attended a second assessment a mean of 12.1 months later and players who returned for a follow-up were not significantly different in demographics, baseline neuropsychological test performance or any imaging measures compared to players who did not return for follow-up.\nRugby players were compared to three control groups. A non-collision sport cross-sectional (Sport Controls), a non-sport cross-sectional (Non-Sport Controls) and nonsport longitudinal control group (Longitudinal Controls). Sport Controls were younger than rugby players (t ¼ À3.44, P ¼ 0.0022, d ¼ 1.05) with no difference in proportion of males to females. Non-Sport Controls were well matched for age, but had a lower proportion of males to female (X 2 ¼ 10.7, P ¼ 0.001, V ¼ 0.42) than the rugby players. Longitudinal Controls were older than the rugby players who returned for their longitudinal assessment (t ¼ 6.28, P  0.001, d ¼ 2.16) but were matched for gender.

An individualized assessment of FA was planned to identify abnormalities in DTI using methods previously described 83 . An analysis of brain atrophy comparing rugby players and a sub-group of controls with longitudinal data were also planned using previously described methods. 65 Non-sport and sport control groups were combined as an All controls group for comparisons with the largest N. This was done for a comparison of demographics, neuropsychological test performance and voxelwise diffusion and cross-sectional volumetric imaging analyses. Further sub-analyses were performed using the Sport and Non-Sport Control groups individually to investigate the effect of sports participation and test if the group-wise differences in diffusion measures remained. Rugby players were also split into sub-acutely and non-acutely injured players to investigate the effects of a sub-acute injury on neuropsychological performance and imaging metrics. Longitudinal controls, who were not screened for sports participation, were used for longitudinal volumetric imaging analyses comparisons against a group of both subacutely and non-acutely injury players, combined to maintain large enough group sizes for powering. A subgroup analysis was performed using only male Rugby Union players and utilised the same methodology as the main analyses but included only male non-sport and sport controls for cross-sectional comparisons.\nGroup differences between all rugby players and all controls in demographics and neuropsychological performances were investigated using t-tests, with effect sizes reported using Cohens d. The effect of sub-acute injury and sports participation on neuropsychological test performance was assessed using an analysis of variance with Tukey multiple post hoc comparisons of means. FDR correction for multiple comparisons was used. Details on neuroimaging statistical analysis are detailed in the neuroimaging section. Pearsons correlation was used to test the relationship between JD and FA, and between the neuropsychological test score performances and neuroimaging metrics.

This approach is illustrated in the case study presented in Fig. 4. Conventional MRI of this rugby player with a sub-acute injury showed no evidence of abnormalities. In contrast, FA averaged across specific white matter tracts showed abnormalities in the genu of the corpus callosum, and left and right corticospinal tract, with low FA characteristic of white matter abnormality. Across the whole cohort, there was a higher proportion of rugby players with DTI abnormalities defined in this way than controls (X 2 ¼ 3.97, P ¼ 0.046, V ¼ 0.21). Seventeen per cent of rugby players (742) had abnormalities in mean FA in at least one of the sampled tracts, compared to 3 of Non-Sport Controls (132).

Voxelwise comparison of JD maps between rugby players who attended 2 visits and the Longitudinal Control group showed lower white matter JD in rugby players, specifically within the lateral occipital cortex and post central gyri (Fig. 8A). A lower JD suggests that either the rate of volume expansion was lower in rugby players than controls, or players were losing volume at a higher rate than controls. Longitudinal Controls were slightly older than the rugby players (mean age in years 33.3 versus 24.8, t ¼ 6.28, P  0.001), and so would be expected to have lower JD values than the rugby players. However, the reverse was true. Sampling the mean JD values from these regions revealed that 50 of players (918) had mean JD values below zero (indicating brain volume loss) compared to 25 of controls (416) (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that the rugby players had an abnormal trajectory of white matter volume change for individuals of that age (Fig. 8C).

We removed 3 non-sport controls at the higher range of FSIQ scores so that the non-sport controls (n ¼ 29) and rugby players (n ¼ 42) were matched for premorbid intelligence. Running the individualized DTI assessment with FSIQ matched controls, players previously identified as abnormal on DTI remained abnormal. Furthermore, FSIQ scores were not correlated with mean FA within rugby players or controls.",

      "text": "We investigated if there were any differences in the results when looking at scans from male rugby union players only (n ¼ 37) and included only male controls for the cross-sectional comparison. A similar pattern of abnormalities was observed, with 11 of rugby players (435) with DTI abnormalities and 8 with microbleeds (337). In total, 19 of players (737) had evidence of diffuse axonal or DVI. Voxelwise comparisons of diffusion metrics showed similar results, with reductions in FA and NDI in non-acutely injured rugby players persisting. With 3 players excluded from the longitudinal volumetric analysis (n ¼ 15), the area of abnormality in JD within the white matter remained but was slightly reduced in size.",

      "text": "Our longitudinal observational study shows abnormalities of brain structure associated with elite rugby participation. DTI and SWI were used to assess white matter structure and evidence of axonal injury was seen in several players studied. Across the group of rugby players studied abnormalities of FA and other diffusion measures were seen. In contrast, sport playing controls were not classified as showing abnormalities of FA. We also studied changes in brain structure over time. Abnormal trajectories of white matter volume were seen in elite rugby players, suggesting an impact of elite rugby participation on brain development. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate MR imaging changes in active elite rugby players. Diffusion imaging abnormalities of FA, neurite density and MD were seen in the rugby group. Similar directions of change are seen in other mild TBI patients scanned in the chronic stage 40,45,87 and longitudinally 88 after an injury. We used an individualized approach to DTI analysis to identify players with neuroimaging abnormalities. 83 This allowed us to investigate the structure of a number of large white matter tracts in a focussed way. Twentythree per cent of the rugby players showed signs of either diffuse axonal or DVI. The majority of the players with evidence of DAI showed abnormalities within the corticospinal tract. Reductions in FA are associated with abnormalities of motor function in other contexts. 89,90 Although this was not explicitly assessed, the players studied did not show any evident abnormalities of motor function and all players were successfully competing at an elite level. However, retired rugby players have been shown to display reduced fine motor control ability. 18,91 Therefore, it is possible that reductions of FA within the corticospinal tract might be significant in terms of future motor function.\nAbnormalities of white matter structure are correlated with clinical features of injury severity and neuropsychological test performance following moderate-severe TBI, with evidence of DAI (low FA) usually associated with cognitive impairment. 24,34,65 Although the rugby players we studied showed did show poorer performance on a number of cognitive tests, cognitive performance did not correlate with white matter abnormalities. Players with white matter abnormalities did not perform significantly worse than those classified as normal. Rather than effect of a rugby participation or sub-acute injury, the difference in performance observed across a select number of neuropsychological tests may have been related to group differences in IQ and appears unrelated to injury or imaging abnormalities within this study.\nMulti-shell diffusion-MRI was acquired. This allowed Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) to be performed. NODDI is an advanced diffusion MRI technique was used to calculate a range of diffusion metrics that potentially provide more sensitive and specific diffusion metrics of white matter pathology. NODDI separates the diffusion signal from three different tissue compartments: intra-neurite (restricted diffusion), extra-neurite (hindered diffusion) and cerebrospinal fluid (free diffusion) to extract a NDI, ODI and ISOVF. 92 Subacutely after a mild TBI, studies have observed reduced NDI, 93 which has correlated with reductions in FA and increased symptom load. 42 In athletes not acutely injured, but with a history of injury, studies have found abnormalities in FA which were negatively correlated to ODI. 40,94 We extend these findings by showing widespread reductions in NDI in our non-acutely injured rugby players, but not in the sub-acutely injured players, with no differences in ODI or ISOVF. These results are suggestive of lower white matter tissue density and that the FA and MD findings are not primarily driven by variations in free water volume.\nModerate-severe TBI produces a progressive loss of brain volume, particularly affecting the white matter. 65,95 This is a marker of the progressive neurodegenerative process that can be triggered by TBI. 96 Abnormal white matter volume changes were observed in the rugby group. Reductions in a region of white matter volume, as defined by a negative JD, were seen in around 50 of the rugby players studied, and a higher rate of white matter volume loss was seen across the group when compared to a control group who were slightly older. White matter volume is expected to increase until the age of around 40, 64,97 and this pattern was seen in our control group who had longitudinal imaging. The rugby players studied had an average age of 25 years old and the oldest was 31 years old. In this age range reductions of white matter volume are abnormal and may be an early sign of an active neurodegenerative process that might increase the risk of neurodegenerative disease in later life. The pathological correlates of abnormal white matter volume we detected with advanced neuroimaging in rugby players is unknown and requires more investigation. However, evidence of CTE in retired professional rugby players has been previously observed, 212223 and in deceased professional Scottish football players where head injury risk is lower but exposure to heading the football is seen as a unique sport-specific risk factor, a five-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease was identified. 61 The current focus of head injury management programmes in sport is the identification of defined observable signs, such as loss of consciousness and ataxia, 98 and assessment for the presence of characteristic symptoms and alterations from baseline in cognitive function and balance. Effective surveillance at the elite and community levels of Rugby Union is overseen in the UK by the Rugby Football Union and any signs or symptoms of mTBI routinely lead to a players removal from play and a graduated return to play once these have resolved. Animal studies show that early markers of neurodegeneration such as tau pathology, vascular damage and neuroinflammation can be produced by mild injuries of the type frequently experienced by professional rugby players. 7,99100101102 However, an important observation is that this pathology can be seen in the absence of concussive symptoms. Players in a range of sports are repeatedly exposed to head impacts in matches and training that may in themselves be sufficient to result in the subsequent development of neurodegenerative pathology. However, these impacts would not trigger removal from play and are not routinely measured over a players career. Further studies of both active and retired rugby players are needed to investigate whether these subthreshold impacts as well as reported mTBIs are associated with evidence of brain injury and to ascertain how cumulative injury burden relates to neurodegeneration and ongoing brain health.\nWe compared rugby players with a recent history of mTBI to those without. Reduced MD was seen in subacutely injured rugby players compared to non-acutely injured players, although there were no differences when compared to the control group. This is in keeping with several previous studies of sport mTBI, which have shown reduced diffusivity alongside elevated FA in recently injured players. 42,103,104 Other diffusion metrics did not show any abnormalities sub-acutely after injury. Previous studies have described the dynamic nature of diffusion changes seen in the early stages of TBI where FA increases initially in the acute to sub-acute period. 27 However, sub-acutely injured players did not show abnormalities of FA compared to controls. Similar findings have been described in other studies of non-acutely injured contact sport athletes. 105106107 In the context of reduced FA observed in our non-acutely injured players, the absence of evidence for diffusion changes in sub-acutely injured players may be due to the acute effects being occluded by longer term reductions in FA.\nThree players also had microbleeds visible on their SWI, an abnormality not seen in any of our non-sporting controls, but observed in 1 sporting control. Microbleeds are a marker of DVI and are produced by small perivascular haemorrhage that can be missed by conventional imaging and that remains visible on SWI because of the persistence of haemosiderin laden macrophages in the perivsascular region. 52,108 Previous studies of have reported the presence of microbleeds after mild TBI, including in contact sport athletes. 56,109 We extend these findings by showing that microbleeds can occur in the absence of diffusion abnormalities and vice versa. The distinct information identified by these two imaging methods has recently been shown in moderate-severe TBI. 52 This illustrates that DVI and DAI can occur independently after TBI and that SWI and diffusion MRI provide complementary information about the presence of subtle brain injury.\nThere are some limitations to our study. Our longitudinal control group were non-sport controls, meaning that the effect of exercise was not controlled for in our longitudinal analyses. However, we do not believe this likely to have a large effect on the comparison as evidence suggests exercise should lead to higher grey and white matter volume. 110111112 A further limitation to our study was that we had gender and age differences in our control groups when compared to the rugby players. We minimised this effect by modelling age in all groupwise analyses, and gender where appropriate. One potential limitation is that diffusion metrics such as FA have been shown to be related to premorbid intelligence scores, 113,114 which were higher in our control group. This did not appear to be a major confound for our results, as a sensitivity analysis showed no difference in classification of DTI abnormalities in rugby players when the groups were matched for FSIQ, and intelligence scores were not correlated to FA. Our non-collision sport control group were also not professional athletes and not matched for BMI which limits our ability to exclude the effect of high-level sporting participation on our results. We only had a small sample of players who had a followed-up visit, meaning we were not well powered to investigate the effect of a sub-acute injury on longitudinal volume change, which may be influenced by the resolution of oedema or inflammation, and lacked longitudinal DTI to help interpret the volumetric changes. Our sports control group was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences in a group wise analysis. We therefore utilised an individualized analysis to detect abnormalities in FA, and did not observe any abnormalities in our sports control group compared to 17 of rugby players.\nIt is important to note that our results in adult professional rugby union and league players are not directly comparable to play at the community or youth levels. The overall health benefit of participating in sports and physical exercise have been well established including the reduction in mortality and chronic diseases such as dementia, 115,116 and have been explored in detail within rugby. 117 In the general professional sport setting, evidence of long-term health benefits includes lower allcause mortality. 61,118 The clinical implications on an individual level of the imaging changes associated with elite rugby participation are unclear. In retired rugby players, a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, with no evidence of exposure to repetitive head injuries nor participation in elite rugby affecting later life mental health, social or work functioning was found. 18 In conclusion, our study shows diffusion and brain volume abnormalities in adult male and female rugby union and league players competing at an elite level. The results are in keeping with the presence of axonal injury, potentially related to repeated head impacts. Unexpected reductions in brain volume were seen in around 50 of the rugby players studied, which might indicate excess neurodegeneration in white matter tracts affected by injury. Rugby governing bodies, including the Rugby Football Union, are increasingly active collaborators in a range of head injury prevention and management projects as well as cross-sectional studies looking at brain health in retired players. 119,120 To date these have rarely had a major focus on reporting neuroimaging changes. Further longitudinal imaging research in active and retired rugby players is needed to understand the impact of both repeated sports-related head impacts and head injuries on brain structure, and to clarify whether the abnormalities we have observed are related to an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease and impaired neurocognitive function following elite rugby participation.",

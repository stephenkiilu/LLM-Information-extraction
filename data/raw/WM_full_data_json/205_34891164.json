    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimers disease (AD) (Petersen et al. 1999;Gauthier et al. 2006). MCI can reach 10-15 for the annual AD conversion rate, much higher than healthy elders of 1-2 (Petersen et al. 2001). The AD progression is irreversible (Sperling et al. 2011;Hyman et al. 2012). Early screening for MCI could help with the early intervention and delay AD progression (Jessen et al. 2014). Therefore, detecting MCI could help to reduce the risk and lessen the social burden of AD.\nThe white matter could be an effective biomarker for MCI. According to the biomarker modeling of AD, the time sequence of AD biomarker is amyloid β (Aβ) deposit, hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), white matter degeneration, gray matter atrophy, functional connectivity decline (Sachdev et al. 2013). Although Aβ and pTau protein deposits are the earliest biomarkers to appear during AD progression (Guo et al. 2020), it is invasive and costly for MCI preliminary screening (Jack et al. 2018). Therefore, exploring noninvasive biomarkers could facilitate large-scale MCI screening. Compared with abnormal changes of gray matter and functional connectivity (Jack et al. 2010;Jack and Holtzman 2013), the white matter demyelination has been proved to appear earlier during AD progression (Zhuang et al. 2012;Lee et al. 2015). The latest research had shown that genes control the changes in white matter microstructure (Zhao et al. 2021). Genes affecting white matter microstructure may occur decades before the onset of AD (Yu et al. 2021). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect subtle structural changes in white matter fibers, facilitating large-scale noninvasive screening (Tournier 2019). However, what and how the white matter fiber tracts degenerate during MCI remains largely unclear.\nFirst of all, compared with the whole-brain white matter degeneration of AD, MCI is found to have selective white matter reductions in the limbic system (Huang et al. 2012;Lee et al. 2014), and it is found that pathological changes spread to the whole brain by white matter fiber pathways in the limbic system from MCI to AD (Daianu et al. 2015;Jones et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2016). As a crucial part of the limbic system, the hippocampus is the key area for memory processing (Bender et al. 2020), and the primary clinical manifestation of MCI is memory loss (Gainotti et al. 2014). Therefore, investigating the abnormal changes of hippocampus-related white matter could promote the timely detection of MCI. Current studies mainly focused on revealing the white matter degeneration in the limbic system of MCI. However, whether the hippocampus-related white matter fiber tracts degenerate during MCI remains largely unclear.\nFor the first question, previous studies on Aβ and pTau, gray matter structure, and functional connectivity imply that white matter fibers connecting the hippocampus and the temporal lobe could early degenerate in MCI. Firstly, Aβ and pTau deposits cause the demyelination of white matter fibers (Jagust 2018), in which Aβ and pTau deposition are firstly detected in the medial temporal lobe near the hippocampus in MCI (Rieckmann et al. 2016;Blamire 2018;Rabin et al. 2019). Secondly, gray matter atrophy spreads from the hippocampus to the temporal lobe during MCI (Lee et al. 2014;Lombardi et al. 2020). It is proved that gray matter atrophy follows by white matter reduction (Agosta et al. 2011). Thirdly, different parts of the temporal lobe showed significantly decreased functional connectivity with the hippocampus in MCI (Lee et al. 2014;Cai et al. 2017). Researches have proved that the degeneration of white matter causes abnormal functional connectivity between the fiber connected regions (Vazquez-Rodriguez et al. 2019;Li et al. 2020a;Liu et al. 2021). Considering that plenty of white matter fiber tracts that connect the hippocampus to parahippocampal regions in the temporal lobe (Zhuo et al. 2016), we hypothesize that the hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts play a key role in the white matter reductions of MCI.\nSecondly, besides memory loss, MCI patients also suffer from affective symptoms (Saunders and Summers 2011). Through white matter fiber tracts, the thalamus connects the subcortical nuclei and cerebral cortex (Abivardi and Bach 2017;Zheng et al. 2019). Fiber tracts connecting the thalamus and the hippocampus form the Papez circuit, which controls memory processing (Bubb et al. 2017). In addition, the thalamus connects the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe via projection fiber tracts, which regulate emotion and cognition (Gerstenecker et al. 2017;Gu and Zhang 2019). Although degeneration has been found in the white matter fibers connecting the thalamus and the hippocampus in MCI (Tang et al. 2017), it remains unclear whether there exist white matter reductions between the thalamus and cerebral cortex (frontal and parietal lobes) in MCI.\nFor the second question, previous researches on gray matter structures and functional connectivity indicated that the projection fiber tracts from the thalamus connected frontal and parietal lobes could degenerate in MCI. Firstly, gray matter atrophy progresses from the subcortical nucleus to the cerebral cortex from MCI to AD (Nie et al. 2017). Research has proved that gray matter atrophy occurs after white matter reduction (Agosta et al. 2011). Secondly, decreased functional connectivity between the thalamus and the medial temporal lobe affects the memory in MCI (Cai et al. 2015;Min et al. 2019), and thalamus has abnormal functional connectivity with the prefrontal lobe and the precuneus impacts the execution and emotion in MCI (Fjell et al. 2017;Scott et al. 2017). Considering that the projection fiber tracts connect the thalamus to the frontal and parietal lobes (Gong et al. 2017), we further hypothesize that the projection fiber tracts play a key role in the white matter reductions of MCI.\nIn the end, some MCI patients are also accompanied by depression (Richard et al. 2013;Bunce et al. 2014;Se et al. 2017). Previous researches indicated that depression is a crucial factor in converting MCI to AD (Devanand et al. 2003;Barca et al. 2017;Tan et al. 2019). Studies on depression have discovered that white matter reductions in projection fiber tracts disrupt the transmission of information between the cerebral cortex and subcortical nucleus, which increases the likelihood of developing depression (Korgaonkar et al. 2014a;Yatawara et al. 2019). However, it is still unclear whether the white matter degeneration in MCI is associated with depression. For this question, functional connectivity between the thalamus and the prefrontal lobe is found to be abnormal both in depression and MCI (Min et al. 2019). Secondly, it has been found that the white matter degeneration in the projection fiber tracts may lead to depression (Korgaonkar et al. 2014b;Bracht et al. 2015), in which the projection fiber tract connects the thalamus and the prefrontal lobe. Therefore, we further hypothesize that the projection fiber reduction might be associated with MCI and depression.\nThe aim of this study is to identify the white matter reduction pathways in MCI. Here, 42 MCI patients and 54 normal control (NC) were recruited. MRI images were acquired, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), T 1 -weighted images (T1w). All participants were examined with the mini mental state examination (MMSE) and the cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI) to gauge their cognitive abilities. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) was also conducted to evaluate their depression degree. Fibers were firstly tracked using the constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm on DTI data, in which regions of interest (ROIs) for fiber tracking were determined by rs-fMRI. Then, statistical analysis and machine learning classification were performed on DTI indexes to quantify abnormal fiber tracts between MCI and NC. Finally, Pearsons correlations were conducted to further reveal the relationships between DTI indexes and behavior scores (cognitive and depression tests). We speculate that this study could provide novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.",

Our experiments confirmed the perspectives by statistical differences and classification. Furthermore, FA reflects the density of white matter fibers and inf luence by the axon diameter of fiber tracts. MD represents the integrity of the myelin outer the fiber tracts. Demyelination can cause MD to increase (Tournier 2019). It could be inferred that disintegrated myelin appeared more obvious than axon loss during MCI.

    "White Matter Reductions in Hippocampus-Temporal Fiber Tracts in MCI Patients": {
      "text": "White matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts on both hemispheres are important biomarkers of MCI. Firstly, research has shown that neurofibrillary tangles appeared in hippocampal substructures such as fimbria and subiculum previous to MCI (Amaral et al. 2018). Substantial fiber interactions exist between hippocampal substructures and the temporal lobe (Zeineh et al. 2017). Research on brain connectivity mapping has established white matter pathways connecting the hippocampus and surrounding temporal lobe (Zhuo et al. 2016). For example, the fornix is an external extension of the fimbria. The posterior cingulate gyrus is connected to the subiculum (Zeineh et al. 2017), which degenerates in MCI (Teipel et al. 2016;Dumont et al. 2019). Our study further confirms the degeneration of hippocampustemporal fiber tracts.\nSecondly, compared with NC, MD indexes in the hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts in MCI presented a significant increase (Figs 1 and2C). Considering that increased MD indexes ref lect damage to myelin and sheath integrity, our results indicate damage to myelin integrity in the white matter of hippocampustemporal fiber tracts in MCI. In addition, the machine learning classification performance of single fiber tract also revealed white matter reduction of hippocampustemporal fiber tracts in MCI (Fig. 3).\nFurthermore, significant negative correlations existed between the MD indexes in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts and cognitive behavior scores (Fig. 4; Table 2). It indicates that white matter reduction in hippocampustemporal fiber tracts is significantly correlated with cognitive impairment. In summary, statistical differences, classification performance, and Pearsons correlation with cognitive behavior show that white matter reduction in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts is a crucial biomarker of MCI.",

    "Early Pathological Structural Changes Reflected by Damage to Hippocampus-Temporal Fiber Tracts": {
      "text": "White matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts can indicate structural changes associated with the early pathology of MCI.\nFor MCI, the hippocampus is a critical hub of the brain network for memory (Battaglia et al. 2011). Changes in white matter microstructure near the hippocampus cause neural information related to cognition transfer to be interrupted (Misic et al. 2014). White matter microstructure changes in MCI are regulated by genes and influenced by Aβ and pTau protein deposits (Jagust 2018). Disruption of white matter pathways then causes gray matter atrophy and functional connectivity to decline.\nFirstly, changes in white matter microstructure by genes may occur decades before the onset of AD (Zhao et al. 2021). Different genes related to MCI all directly or indirectly affect white matter microstructures near the hippocampus (Yu et al. 2021). Aβ and pTau protein deposits also cause fiber demyelination (Jagust 2018). In the pre-MCI stage, small Aβ and pTau protein deposits can already be detected near the hippocampus (Gold et al. 2014;Molinuevo et al. 2014;Rieckmann et al. 2016). During MCI, Aβ and pTau protein deposits expand toward the temporal lobe and cause demyelination (Chao et al. 2013;Kantarci et al. 2017). In AD, Aβ and pTau protein deposition are the most severe in the temporal lobe, and lesions develop toward the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe (Adriaanse et al. 2014;Canter et al. 2016). Genetic and protein researches provide evidence that early pathological changes in the white matter of hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts can serve as a biomarker of MCI.\nSecondly, research has shown that the hippocampus was the first to display gray matter atrophy during MCI (Zanchi et al. 2017;Bender et al. 2020). As the disease progresses, the medial temporal lobe surrounding hippocampus is atrophied (Younes et al. 2014) until the entire temporal lobe atrophies in AD (Perrotin et al. 2015). Gray matter atrophies are followed by white matter reduction (Agosta et al. 2011). Therefore, gray matter atrophy progressing from hippocampus to temporal lobe confirms that the hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts are early pathways for MCI white matter reduction network.\nFinally, research has shown that the weakened functional connectivity between the hippocampus and temporal lobe in MCI was associated with memory loss (Lee et al. 2014). The weakened functional connectivity between brain regions was caused by reductions in white matter pathways connecting these brain regions (Vazquez-Rodriguez et al. 2019). Previous research has demonstrated that damage to the posterior cingulate gyrus could cause reduced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the precuneus (Li et al. 2020b). The reduced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and temporal lobe pointed to white matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts, associated with memory loss. In summary, our study first put forward white matter reductions of hippocampustemporal fiber tracts in MCI. Combined with previous research, it confirms that the hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts are early pathways for MCI white matter reduction network.",

    "White Matter Reductions in Thalamus-Related Fiber Tracts": {
      "text": "White matter reductions in thalamus-related fiber tracts are an important biomarker of MCI. Firstly, our results show that white matter reduction in fornix and ATR during MCI, which is consistent with previous researches (Christiansen et al. 2016;Chen et al. 2020). Furthermore, we find that MD indexes of the ALIC connecting the thalamus and the subcortical nucleus, the slMFB and SCR connecting the thalamus to the frontal and parietal lobes are all increased significantly (Fig. 1). MD variations in thalamus-related fiber tracts are significantly higher than normal fiber tracts (Fig. 2C). Secondly, left lateralization of white matter reductions appears in thalamusrelated fiber tracts. MD variations of the white matter in the left hemisphere are significantly higher than right (Fig. 2E). All participants are right-handed, so their left brains are the dominant hemisphere. The left hemisphere is mainly associated with memories (Banks et al. 2018), and the primary symptom of MCI is memory loss. So, abnormalities are more likely to appear in the left hemisphere than right (Yang et al. 2017;Weise et al. 2018).\nFurthermore, the classifier trained by features of MD indexes in thalamus-related fiber tracts has a high separability for MCI and NC, whereas the accuracy and AUC of the normal fiber tracts are no better than random level (Fig. 3). The classification performances further demonstrate that white matter reductions exist in the thalamus-related fiber tracts of MCI. Finally, significant negative correlations exist between the MD indexes of thalamus-related fiber tracts and CASI scores (Fig. 4; Table 2). It demonstrates that white matter reductions in the thalamus-related fiber tracts are significantly correlated with cognitive impairment. In summary, statistical differences, classification performance, and Pearsons correlation with cognitive behavior all show that reductions in the white matter of thalamus-related fiber tracts are a crucial biomarker of MCI.",

    "Pathways of White Matter Reductions Between Subcortical Nucleus and Cerebral Cortex": {
      "text": "Thalamus-related fiber tracts are crucial pathways of white matter reductions between the subcortical nucleus and cerebral cortex during MCI. First of all, previous research regarding the subcortical nucleus has shown gray matter atrophy occurs in the hippocampus, thalamus, and Pallidum (PAL) of MCI (Rahayel et al. 2018;Tuokkola et al. 2019). Furthermore, decreased functional connectivity has been found between thalamus and hippocampus (Cai et al. 2017) and between thalamus and PAL (Liu et al. 2021) in MCI. Our study found white matter reductions in the fornix connecting the thalamus and the hippocampus and in the ALIC connecting the thalamus and PAL (Fig. 2). From the perspective of white matter pathways, our results explain the structural and functional abnormalities in the thalamus and subcortical nucleus in MCI.\nFurthermore, the thalamus is connected to frontal and parietal lobes via projection fiber tracts. Although the frontal and parietal lobes in MCI do not show apparent gray matter atrophy (Pini et al. 2016), research has shown decreased functional connectivity between thalamus and prefrontal lobe (Cai et al. 2015) and between thalamus and motor area in parietal lobe (Gu and Zhang 2019). The thalamus and prefrontal lobe interactions are in charge of emotional and cognitive control (Hiser and Koenigs 2018). The interactions between the motor area of the parietal lobe and the thalamus are in charge of primary motor (Hannanu et al. 2017). Our study found white matter reductions in the ATR and slMFB connecting the thalamus and the prefrontal lobe and the SCR connecting the thalamus and the motor area in parietal lobe (Fig. 2). Our results explain the structural and functional abnormalities in the thalamus and cerebral cortex of MCI patients from the perspective of white matter pathways.\nIn addition, most studies regarding MCI hold that white matter degeneration spreads to the frontal lobe along the cingulate gyrus (Wong et al. 2020). However, we found no significant difference in anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus between MCI and NC (Fig. 1). Among the thalamus-related fiber tract pathways, we find obvious white matter abnormalities in the fornix connecting the hippocampus and the thalamus and in the projection fiber tracts connecting the thalamus and the frontal and parietal lobes (Fig. 2). We speculate that the degeneration of white matter in the frontal and parietal lobes may spread through the thalamus-related fiber tracts. In summary, the thalamus is the relay station between subcortical nuclei and cerebral cortex. We speculate that during MCI, white matter reductions in thalamusrelated fiber tracts may interrupt transmissions between subcortical nucleus and the cerebral cortex.",

    "Hippocampus-Temporal and Thalamus-Related Fiber Tracts Are Related to Cognitive Behavior": {
      "text": "White matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts can reflect impaired cognitive abilities in MCI. The previous study has shown that the MMSE (Folstein et al. 1975) is an effective preliminary screening tool for MCI (Creavin et al. 2016). However, CASI (Teng et al. 1994) has a more comprehensive scoring range than MMSE in gauging the cognitive abilities of patients (Yang et al. 2018). Our studies found that the MD indexes of HIPtemporal and thalamus-related fiber tracts all revealed significant negative correlations with the CASI score.\nHowever, for the cognitive score MMSE, only MD indexes of HIP-temporal fiber tracts reveal significant negative correlations with it (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 5). In summary, our results indicate that white matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts are more effective in ref lecting impaired cognitive abilities in MCI. Thus, taking MD indexes in hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts as a biomarker will more objectively ref lect cognitive behavior in future MCI diagnoses.",

    "White Matter Reductions in Thalamus-Related Fiber Tracts Are Correlated With Both MCI and Depression": {
      "text": "Among all fiber tracts with white matter reduction in MCI, thalamus-related fiber tracts are associated with depression. Firstly, researches have shown that sometimes MCI is also accompanied by depression (Richard et al. 2013;Bunce et al. 2014). Research on depression alone has found reductions in the white matter pathways of projection fiber tracts between the thalamus and the medial frontal lobe (Yatawara et al. 2019). Research on MCI has shown that weakened functional connectivity between the medial frontal lobe and the thalamus is associated with depression (Li et al. 2014). Our results indicate that white matter reduction in slMFB, ATR, and SCR in MCI is consistent with previous research on depression alone and provides new evidence regarding MCI and depression. Secondly, for all fiber tracts with white matter reduction in MCI, only thalamusrelated fiber tracts are associated with both MCI and depression (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, for thalamus-related fiber tracts in MCI and NC, only MCI shows significant positive correlations between the MD indexes and GDS scores (Supplementary Fig. 8). In summary, our study demonstrates that white matter reductions in thalamus-related fiber tracts are associated with both MCI and depression.",

    "Feature Extraction of Specific Fiber Could Improve Classification Performance for MCI": {
      "text": "For classification between MCI and NC, taking MD indexes of the specific fiber as features contributes to classification performance. From the pathogenesis of AD, white matter reduction first appears on specific fiber tracts in MCI, and then it will gradually spread to the whole brain until the AD stage (Daianu et al. 2015;Jones et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2016). The research explains this phenomenon well from machine learning (Dou et al. 2020). Automated fiber quantification (AFQ) is used to sample each fiber tract and merge them as features to train the SVM model. This model performed well for the classification of AD and NC (accuracy about 80), which was much better than the classification of MCI and NC (accuracy about 59). It also prompted that sampling by AFQ or mean MD in the whole brain may weaken features for MCI. So, we focused on individual fiber tracts and taken MD indexes of each voxel into a feature set.\nAll fiber tracts with white matter reductions had good classification performance (accuracy  60, AUC  0.6). The best reached accuracy  71.27 and AUC  0.7463 in HIP-temporal fiber tracts. Our method performs well for MCI classification to a certain extent. However, it causes a high calculation cost because of taking all voxels into a feature set. In the future, AFQ will be considered to sample individual fiber tracts in MCI. Both classification performance and computational complexity will be taken into account.",

      "text": "To ensure the generalization ability of SVM model, crossvalidation was widely used (Dwyer et al. 2018;Madsen et al. 2018;Yamashita et al. 2020). Previous research used one discovery dataset to train the SVM model and another replicated dataset to test, which proved the cross-validation method well for generalization (Dou et al. 2020). Our research is consistent with this research in feature reduction, model training, classification, and performance evaluation. Our method is based on previous researches (Dou et al. 2020;Raghu et al. 2020). Internal 5-fold cross-validation was used to search hyperparameters, and 100 random repetitions of the holdout method were used externally. Although the generalization of our model has been controlled, several improvements could be conducted in the future. Firstly, to obtain multiple data sets to test the generalization of the classifier. Secondly, to use integrated learning for multiple models, stack generalization, and build a repository of machine learning models.",

    "Limitations and Future Works": {
      "text": "This study finds white matter reductions in hippocampustemporal fiber tracts and thalamus-related fiber tracts in MCI base on statistical difference analysis and machine learning. However, the valuable contributions of this study must be considered within the context of certain limitations. Firstly, this is a cross-sectional study. Longitudinal research will be required to verify the degeneration of white matter structures during the progression from MCI to AD. Secondly, future studies should recruit participants with both MCI and depression. The NC, MCI with depression, and MCI without depression should be divided to investigate the comorbid white matter pathways in-depth for MCI and depression. Thirdly, future studies should adopt more advanced diffusion weighted imaging technology to track white matter fibers with greater precision, such as high angular diffusion magnetic imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging. Fourthly, future studies should adopt DTI indexes in whole-brain white matter as features for machine learning and then utilize recursive feature elimination to rank the crucial white matter fiber tracts for MCI diagnosis. Finally, an open question of MCI is the potential pathological lesions that characterize this disease. Although current works focus on investigating differences in certain white matter pathways in MCI, it is also necessary to further understand the correlation between white matter degeneration and other disease markers. In the future, we plan to adopt a multimodal approach to corroborate different MCI biomarkers, such as combining Aβ, pTau, and rs-fMRI.",

      "text": "The primary finding in this study is white matter reductions in hippocampus-temporal and thalamus-related fiber tracts in MCI. Firstly, hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts are early pathways through which white matter reductions spread from hippocampus to temporal lobe. White matter reductions of hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts can ref lect cognitive impairment in MCI. Secondly, thalamus-related fiber tracts are pathways through which white matter reductions spread from subcortical nucleus to cerebral cortex. Among all fiber tracts with reductions in MCI, thalamus-related fiber tracts are associated with depression. Therefore, our study adds to the network-based theories of AD that abnormalities selectively target vulnerable regions and propagate across intrinsic networks via specific neuronal pathways. Our study suggests the application of targeted interventions to hippocampus-temporal fiber tracts and thalamus-related fiber tracts.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Prophylaxis to prevent meningeal relapse after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma used to consist of both intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (CT) and cranial radiotherapy (CRT). The neurotoxic adverse effects of prophylactic CRT became apparent during the 1980s and are well documented. 1 Around that time, CRT was mostly abolished and replaced with more intensive IT CT. 234 Knowledge of late effects is mostly restricted to the first decade after treatment, 5-8 but these effects may have an impact on quality of life for many decades because both long-term survival rates and general life expectancy keep increasing. This study provides information about the long-term impact of CT and CRT on the maturing brain 20 to 30 years after diagnosis by using magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment. The outcomes will help to better understand these survivors current needs and could aid in anticipating late effects of CT and of CRT that is currently applied for brain tumors and is still used for ALL in some countries.\nThere are many reports on late neurocognitive deficits after CT alone, particularly in the domain of executive functions, although these are relatively subtle compared with the effects of CRT. 9101112 Sequelae seem more severe after high-risk treatment. 13 Advanced neuroimaging techniques allow us to investigate possible neural substrates of these cognitive sequelae. An MR voxel-based morphometry study by Carey et al 7 linked reduction of white matter (WM) volumes within the right frontal lobe to decreased cognitive functioning 10 years after treatment with CT only. The effects of CT beyond 10 years after treatment are sparsely studied. Porto et al 14 studied 10 female ALL survivors, on average 15 years post-treatment with CT only, and found distributed reductions of gray matter and WM concentrations and a trend for decreased WM integrity. Research by Koppelmans et al 15 indicates that cognitive effects of adjuvant CT for breast cancer can persist beyond 20 years after treatment, but it remains unclear how this translates to IT CT in childhood.\nLate neurotoxic effects of CRT include an increased risk of neurologic complications such as vascular malformations, secondary neoplasms, and focal necrosis. 161718 In the cognitive domain, deficits in memory, information processing speed, and attention have been reported. 192021222324 WM volume reduction is more apparent after CRT than after CT and correlates significantly with cognitive impairment. 6 On a microstructural level, DTI is able to quantify WM organization by assessing the restriction of randomly moving water molecules. The degree of directional preference of diffusion is quantified by the DTI parameter fractional anisotropy (FA). Damage to WM microstructures will result in lower FA because of relatively more diffusion of water perpendicular to the fiber orientation. 25 Significant differences in FA between cancer survivors (up to10 years after treatment) and controls have been reported and linked to cognitive impairment. 2627282930 Dellani et al 31 demonstrated WM alterations in 13 CRT-treated ALL survivors 16 to 28 years after treatment. Porto et al 14 demonstrated reduced FA after CRT in 11 males 15 years after treatment for childhood ALL. Associations with cognition remained unaddressed by Dellani and Porto, and they were both unable to demonstrate a relation between FA and age at diagnosis.\nYounger age at treatment with CRT has been associated with more severe WM lesions and worse neurocognitive outcome. 32333435 Progression of radiation-induced WM changes has also been reported. 36,37 Prophylactic CRT (20-30 Gy) for small-cell lung cancer in adults has been associated with early-onset dementia. 38394041 In general, theories are emerging that cancer and cancer treatment may cause accelerated aging of the brain and of cells in general, even after CT without CRT. 42,43 This study investigated WM changes and associated neuropsychological dysfunction 25 years after treatment. The hypothesis of accelerated WM decay will be addressed by comparing the correlations of FA and age between survivors treated with and without CRT and controls. In addition, the relation between age at diagnosis and vulnerability to neurotoxicity of treatment will be explored.",

      "text": "We identified 285 survivors of ALL or lymphoma from patient records of the Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center, the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium. Dates of diagnoses after 1978 were included, and time since diagnosis had to be at least 18 years. After exclusion of 42 survivors (Appendix Fig A1, online only), 243 eligible survivors were contacted. Ninety-six survivors were willing to participate and were asked to recruit a control (sibling, partner, or friend; n ϭ 49). Assessments took place between 2007 and 2011.\nSurvivors were treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)based protocols with a duration of approximately 2 years. 44 Between 1979 and 1983, standard-risk CRT patients were treated according to the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group (DCLSG) protocol ALL-5 or the Riehm protocol, both characterized by CRT (15 to 25 Gy) in addition to five to seven IT injections of 12 to 12.5 mg methotrexate (MTX). This cohort included 24 survivors treated according to a standard-risk CRT protocol. We included seven high-risk (HR) patients from this period, treated with additional customized high-dose MTX intravenously (IV). Around 1983, CRT was abolished and standard-risk patients were treated according to DCLSG protocol ALL-6 (13 ϫ 12 mg MTX IT and 6 gm 2 MTX IV) or European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Trial 58831 (6 ϫ 12 mg MTX IT and 2 gm 2 MTX IV), of which 29 patients were included. HR patients were treated with customized protocols based on either EORTC Trial 58832 (8 ϫ 12 mg MTX IT and 10 gm 2 MTX IV), the BACOP bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone protocol (customized dose of MTX IV), or ALL-6 (customized additional MTX IV) without CRT (HR CT, n ϭ 20). 45 Administration of MTX IV was always followed by leucovorin (12 to 15 mgm 2 every 6 hours until serum levels of MTX had dropped below 10 Ϫ7 molL). Thirteen patients were treated for relapse after standard-risk or HR treatment, seven of whom were irradiated only during relapse and six of whom were irradiated at both initial occurrence and relapse. Group means of dosages were calculated excluding missing data. Dosages of CRT were available for all patients, but dosages of MTX IV were missing for three survivors in the CRT group and dosages of MTX IT were missing for one survivor in the CT group. Three irradiated survivors were excluded because meningiomas were discovered during assessment. Survivors were grouped into irradiated (n ϭ 44) and nonirradiated (n ϭ 49), and dose-dependent effects of CRT, MTX IV, and MTX IT were studied. The ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration were followed and approval was obtained from the local ethical committees.",

The significant interaction effect between these correlations is indicative of accelerated aging (interaction beta ϭ Ϫ. with age, as demonstrated by interacting regressions of FA on AaA between survivors and controls. This significant interaction indicates accelerated aging of WM (Fig 2E). This effect was shown to be larger when the effect of AaD was taken into account (Table 4).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study demonstrated decreased WM integrity, as determined by FA, in a large group of leukemia and lymphoma survivors 25 years after treatment. Younger age at cranial irradiation and higher dosage were associated with lower FA. aging of the irradiated brain was suggested. In addition, decreased FA was significantly associated with neuropsychological dysfunction.\nFor irradiated survivors, both FA and neuropsychological function were significantly below average. The dependence of these longterm outcomes on AaA and dosage is consistent with literature describing short-term outcomes of CRT. 65 The steep decline of FA with AaA compared with controls, most importantly within the frontal and parietal WM, is a strong indication of accelerated aging. In general, the risk of developing dementia increases with age. There are also anatomic similarities between our survivors and patients with Alzheimers disease. Parente et al 66 reported decreased FA in the CC, cingulum, and SLF in patients with Alzheimers disease and those with mild cognitive impairment, similar to what we found. Furthermore, our own magnetoencephalography findings from the same cohort displayed an oscillatory activity pattern resembling the pattern found in patients with Alzheimers disease. 67 Together, these findings suggest that the irradiated survivors could be at increased risk of developing early-onset dementia.\nIn general, FA values correlate well with cognition, in particular with tests of executive functions. 68,69 In this cohort, neuropsychological dysfunction correlated significantly with lower FA in the CC, cingulum, SLF, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and IFOF. These major WM tracts are crucial roadways for functional networks, which is why small focal damage in these tracts can have widespread impact on brain functioning. 68,69 The observed decreases in FA might be related to decreased myelin andor axonal injury. There is evidence that suggests that both CT and CRT can cause early apoptosis of oligodendrocytesessential for the myelinization of axons-and vasculopathy leading to ischemia. 6,14,70-73 Both CT and CRT can limit neural repair by damaging periventricular progenitor cells that would otherwise maintain WM integrity and stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. 74757677 Evidence is accumulating that these processes are fundamental to understanding late cognitive effects and WM decay and are likely to provide targets for future therapeutic interventions. 74,77,78 Furthermore, younger age at treatment with CRT was associated with lower FA, mostly within frontal and parietal WM tracts. These tracts are known to myelinate at a later age than the rest of the brain. 79 This could suggest that CRT affects the cells that create myelin more than it damages existing myelin. This might leave survivors with a lower peak level of WM density in young adulthood. Concurrently, treatment could injure the axons unprotected by myelin.\nFor nonirradiated survivors, both FA values and neuropsychological performance were lower on average, but not more than one standard deviation below the mean of controls. Trends for decreased FA can be shown, confirming findings by Porto et al, 14 but impact on cognition seems to be limited. The CT group displays no signs of accelerated aging. This suggests that, although acute lopathy is frequently reported, long-term effects after 20 years are mild. 80,81 No dose-effect relationship could be established for MTX. Although outcome of nonirradiated survivors was on average within the normal range, there is a small subgroup with below-average FA and related neuropsychological deficiencies. This group should be acknowledged by clinicians. Future research should focus on the identification of this subgroup, identification of the risk factors, and development of preventive measures.\nWith older AaD, the risk of relapse and therefore treatment intensity increase. However, evidence indicates that CRT is more detrimental at younger AaD. This interaction is difficult to quantify but important to acknowledge.\nIn line with previous studies, we observed similar impairments in cognitive functioning 192021222324 and WM integrity in frontal, parietal, and temporal WM tracts. Porto et al 14 reported that WM around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and subcortical frontal WM were the areas most affected. Dellani et al 31 reported decreased FA in the temporal lobes, the hippocampi, and thalami, in which we found decreased FA in WM surrounding these structures. We also found decreased FA in the cingulum, CC, and SLF. Our analysis might have been more sensitive because we used a population-based atlas, which allows for more accurate image registration, and a region of interestindependent analysis. A major strength of this study is the stronger perspective on long-term quality of life than previous studies. We were able to demonstrate age dependence by disentangling the effects of AaD and AaA, a method not applied by either Porto 14 or Dellani. 31 We also used larger patient samples and more homogeneous patient groups, and we excluded patients with pre-existing CNS disorders. The established association between decreased FA and neuropsychological dysfunction in this population is a major contribution to the existing literature. Evidently, longitudinal research with even larger groups is necessary to confirm our accelerated aging hypothesis, which is now based only on cross-sectional data. Alternatively, data from older controls, acquired in the same experimental setting, could be used to investigate similarity of FA levels and cognitive status between older adults and cancer survivors to further support the accelerated aging hypothesis. More research is needed to elucidate the clinical relevance of the observed trends of decreased FA after CT only.\nThevariabilityintreatmentregimens,especiallyintermsofchemotherapeutic agents, might be a limitation of this study. However, this is inevitable when aiming for larger samples. Dose-effect relationships of agents other than MTX should be studied.\nIn conclusion, this study stresses the importance of following cohorts many decades after neurotoxic treatment in childhood, preferably throughout life. The growing support for the concept of accelerated aging after CRT implicates screening for early-onset dementia. Recommending lifestyle modifications that are implicated in slowing the progression of dementia, such as not smoking and getting regular physical exercise, could be considered. 82 Although detrimental effects of CT on WM and neuropsychological function are not completely absent, they are mild compared with CRT, although CT is equally effective in terms of survival and recurrence rates after ALL. 3 This warrants a recommendation to use CRT only as a last resort.",

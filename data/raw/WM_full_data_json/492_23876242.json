    "abstract": "The relationship between brain structure, cortical physiology, and learning ability in older adults is of particular interest in understanding mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline. Only a few studies addressed this issue so far, yielding mixed results. Here, we used comprehensive multiple regression analyses to investigate associations between brain structure on the one hand, i.e., cortical thickness (CT), fractional anisotropy (FA) of the pyramidal tract and individual coil-to-cortex distance, and cortical physiology on the other hand, i.e. motor cortex excitability and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity, in healthy older adults (mean age 64 years, 14 women). Additional exploratory analyses assessed correlations between cortical physiology and learning ability in the verbal domain. In the regression models, we found that cortical excitability could be best predicted by CT of the hand knob of the primary motor cortex (CT-M1 HAND ) and individual coil-to-cortex distance, while LTP-like cortical plasticity was predicted by CT-M1 HAND and FA of the pyramidal tract. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant inverse correlation between cortical excitability and learning ability. In conclusion, higher cortical excitability was associated with lower CT and lower learning ability in a cohort of healthy older adults, in line with previous reports of increased cortical excitability in patients with cortical atrophy and cognitive deficits due to Alzheimers Disease. Cortical excitability may thus be a parameter to identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy, a hypothesis to be explored in future longitudinal studies.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The combined use of imaging techniques with high spatial resolution like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and non-invasive measurements of brain physiology like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has greatly advanced understanding of human brain function (Siebner et al., 2009). With regard to cognitive neuroscience of aging, use of these techniques offers great potential to investigate mechanisms of age-related structural and functional decline. However, most studies focused on young healthy individuals, or on patients with advanced neurodegeneration like Alzheimers Disease (AD). So far, comprehensive evaluations in elderly individuals without overt dementia, most likely to yield information about compensatory mechanisms with regard to cognitive function, have not been conducted.\nDifferent electrophysiological protocols have been used in exploring cortical neurophysiology. Resting motor threshold (rMT) is generally defined as the lowest stimulus intensity of a single pulse TMS that elicits a predefined, small motor response in the contralateral targeted muscle (Rossini et al., 1994). RMT is a measure of the excitability of corticocortical neuronal structures that are directly activated by TMS and project onto corticospinal output neurons (Ziemann, 2004). While being inter-individually highly variable, rMT is relatively stable and thus reproducible in a given individual (Wassermann, 2002). rMT is critically dependent on coil-to-cortex-distance (CCD) in a given subject (Stokes et al., 2005), but might be also influenced by other functional and anatomical parameters, particularly inter-individual structural variability of the motor cortex (Hübers et al., 2012) and age-related anatomical and physiological brain changes (Silbert et al., 2006). For example, a study in healthy young subjects indicated that deep white matter microstructure, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be an important contributor (Klöppel et al., 2008). However, a subsequent study could not confirm these results (Hübers et al., 2012), and thus the association between white matter microstructure and cortical excitability remains to be fully explored in healthy individuals. With regard to pathological conditions, rMT was decreased in patients with predominantly white matter damage as seen in vascular dementia (VAD) (Pennisi et al., 2011) or cortical atrophy due to AD (e.g. (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004;Ferreri et al., 2011). However, a potential association between cortical thickness (CT) and cortical excitability has not been investigated in healthy individuals or in patients so far.\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is assumed to be the basis of learning and memory (Rioult-Pedotti et al., 2000). In humans, LTP-like plasticity can be induced in the primary motor cortex (M1) by the paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol (Stefan et al., 2000). Here, interindividual variability was influenced by age (Fathi et al. 2010;Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008;Tecchio et al., 2008), cognitive decline (Battaglia et al., 2007), and white matter damage (List et al., 2013). Recently, associations between LTP-like cortical plasticity and cortical thickness (CT) in young healthy individuals have been reported (Conde et al., 2012). The association of LTP-like cortical plasticity and CT in older individuals has not been determined so far.\nIn the present study, we investigated associations between measures of brain structure and cortical physiology in a well-defined cohort of healthy older adults. We further asked in an exploratory approach if cortical excitability and LTP-like cortical plasticity were correlated with learning ability.",

Technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale et al., 1999;Fischl et al., 1999Fischl et al., , 2002;;Han et al., 2006). The processing of T1-weighted images included removal of nonbrain tissue (Segonne et al., 2004), automated Talairach transformation and intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998), as well as surface deformation to detect gray matterwhite matter and gray mattercerebrospinal fluid boundaries (Fischl et al., 2001;Segonne et al., 2007). The resulting representation of CT was then calculated as the distance between the above tissue boundaries (Fischl and Dale, 2000). The surface models of each subject were inspected visually for accuracy. For whole-brain cortical thickness analyses, we calculated cortical maps at the vertex-wise level by means of a general linear model (GLM) approach, which is implemented in QDEC from FreeSurfer. Individual CT maps were registered bilaterally to the standard template and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 25 mm FWHM.",

This hand drawn ROI had a size of 1775 vertices. The average thickness within this ROI in each subject was extracted for further multiple regression analyses.\n2.1.6. Diffusion tensor imaging 2.1.6.1. Preprocessing of DTI data. We used FSL for preprocessing and fibertracking the left pyramidal tract (PT; tract containing the fibers originating from left M1), (http:www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). A 3-dimensional rigid body registration was applied to correct for eddy currents and head motion, followed by brain extraction (Smith, 2002). Probability distributions were then calculated, allowing estimation of 2 dimensions per voxel (Behrens et al., 2006). Directional diffusivities were determined as lambda 1 N lambda 2 N lambda 3 and fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated from those eigenvalues.\n2.1.6.2. Probabilistic tractography of the pyramidal tract. In order to reconstruct the PT according to their cortical origins in M1 left , a ROI was drawn in the subcortical white matter on the individual FA maps in native space, as descried previously (Rüber et al., 2012). Further ROIs were placed in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the basis pontis (Lindenberg et al., 2012). Using the brainstem ROI as the seed region and the ipsilateral internal capsule and subcortical ROIs as waypoint masks as well as a sagittal exclusion mask in the corpus callosum, we reconstructed the PT in the left hemisphere: fibers originating from M1, passing through the internal capsule and descending to the anterior pons. Probabilistic maps were generated by iterations of the streamline process. For every seed voxel in the brainstem ROIs, 5000 particles were propagated through the multi-tensor field. The resulting maps of streamline intensities were then constrained to voxels with more than 10 of the individual robust range in order to extract tract-specific FA values of the left PT (FA-PT left ) for regression analyses (see below).",

In optimal position (hot spot) of the coil, a moderately suprathreshold stimulation intensity leads to a visible abduction of the thumb. This hot spot, i.e. the cortical representation area of the right adductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle, was then marked with a soft pen on the subjects scalp. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) of the APB muscle were recorded by surface EMG activity using AgAgCl surface electrodes. The active electrode was placed on the muscle belly, the inactive electrode over the base of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb. The MEP-signals were amplified and digitized and then stored on a laboratory computer for later offline analysis.

PAS consisted of an electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist, followed by a subsequent TMS-impulse over the hot-spot. According to the modified version of PAS, 132 paired stimuli were delivered at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. The interstimulus interval was set to 25 ms, known as the excitatory PAS-protocol (Stefan et al., 2000). Nerve stimulation was applied with a standard stimulation block (cathode proximal) with an intensity of 300 of the individual sensory threshold. TMS pulse intensity was set at 130 of rMT to evoke MEPs with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.5 to 1 mV in the relaxed APB. In order to maintain a standardized level of attention during the PAS intervention, subjects were instructed to stay alert, voluntarily relax the APB of the dominant hand, and count the number of motor responses. Muscle relaxation was continuously monitored by visual feedback from the surface EMG. As PAS-induced MEP facilitation is substantially affected by diurnal cycles (Sale et al., 2008), PAS procedures were performed between 2 pm and 5 pm in all subjects. The complete PAS protocol comprised baseline MEP measurements followed by the PAS stimulation and subsequent MEP measurements immediately after stimulation. MEP amplitudes were measured peak-to-peak in each individual trial before and after intervention. Before and after PAS, MEP were induced 20 times with a random pulse interval between 4 and 6 s. MEP amplitudes after the PAS protocol were then averaged and normalized to the MEP amplitude before PAS for each subject. These PAS-induced MEP changes are referred to as LTP-like cortical plasticity throughout the manuscript.",

These findings were supported by independent whole-brain analyses, showing that individual differences in cortical excitability were selectively associated with CT of a cluster within the left hand knob, but no other cortical areas. Moreover, higher LTP-like cortical plasticity could best be predicted by lower fibre coherence of the pyramidal tract (PT) and CT in M1 HANDleft . Finally, exploratory analyses revealed a correlation between cortical excitability and learning ability: The higher the excitability, the lower the learning ability.",

    "Brain structure and cortical excitability": {
      "text": "Cortical excitability was examined by rMT, which is defined as the lowest stimulus intensity at which single-pulse TMS to M1 of one hand elicits a predefined, small motor response in the contralateral target muscle (Rossini et al., 1994). RMT reflects the trans-synaptic excitability of corticospinal output neurons that are directly activated by TMS (Ziemann, 2004). Sodium and calcium channel blockers that reduce axon excitability elevate rMT, indicating that rMT largely reflects excitability of the axonal membrane rather than transsynaptic neurotransmission (Chen et al., 1997;Ziemann et al., 1996). rMT is critically sensitive to the individual CCD, based on the known properties of magnetic field distributions generated in TMS (McConnell et al., 2001;Stokes et al., 2005Stokes et al., , 2013)), a finding reproduced in the present study. Moreover, it is influenced by several properties of the motor system including geometry of precentral gyrus and orientation of the PT relative to the induced current in the brain, fibre coherence of stimulated axons and spinal cord excitability level (Hübers et al., 2012). However, a large amount of inter-individual variability remains unexplained (Siebner and Ziemann, 2007). Klöppel et al. (2008) reported associations between microstructure of the subcortical white matter, as estimated by FA, and rMT in younger subjects, indicating higher cortical excitability to be linked with higher white matter microstructural integrity. However, the associations between rMT and FA were not seen in the FA of the PT, but in the subcortical white matter outside motor pathways, and no associations between rMT and FA of the PT could be found in a subsequent study (Hübers et al., 2012). Significance of cerebral white matter microstructural integrity on cortical excitability thus remains unclear. In the present study, FA-PT left was not predictive for rMT in our linear regression model. Rather, rMT could best be predicted by CT-M1 HANDleft and CCD left , explaining 40 of variance in our group of healthy older adults.\nThe underlying physiological mechanisms of the association of increased cortical excitability with cortical atrophy (as indicated by lower CT measurements) might lie in an altered balance of different cortical neurotransmitter systems. Here, a modulation of Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic and possibly also cholinergic tone, following neuronal degeneration and functional reorganization has been proposed (Ferreri et al., 2003;Koliatsos et al., 2006). Cortical thinning may reflect a decrease in GABA-mediated intracortical inhibition, following degeneration of GABAergic cortical interneurons (Ferreri et al., 2003), and may result in a decreased threshold for a given TMS pulse to elicit an action potential in corticospinal output neurons. Furthermore, a dysbalance of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamatergic transmission has been suggested to account for hyperexcitability in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004).",

    "Brain structure and LTP-like cortical plasticity": {
      "text": "LTP-like cortical plasticity was increased in individuals with lower white matter fibre coherence in the PT, similar to previous results in both middle-aged and older individuals (List et al., 2011(List et al., , 2013)). PASinduced LTP-like cortical plasticity shares distinct properties with synaptic LTP and is assumed to be the synaptic basis of learning and memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993;Ziemann et al., 2004). Even though several factors influencing the ability to induce LTP-like cortical plasticity in humans are known, e.g. aging (Fathi et al. 2010;Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008;Tecchio et al., 2008), genetic factors (Cheeran et al., 2008;Witte et al., 2012), brain metabolism (List et al., 2012), and white matter microstructural integrity (List et al., 2011(List et al., , 2013)), a large part of inter-individual variability remains to be elucidated. Using linear regression, FA in the PT and CT-M1 HANDleft were able to predict 32 of inter-individual variability in LTP-like cortical plasticity. Interestingly, lower structural fibre coherence of the PT left but higher CT in M1 was associated with higher LTP-like cortical plasticity. Similar to previous studies of our group (List et al., 2011(List et al., , 2013)), the present data further support an active role of LTP-like cortical plasticity to counteract structural decline of the PT, as seen in the negative associations between LTP-like cortical plasticity and FA, in older adults with preserved cognition. As reported previously (Conde et al., 2012), CT-M1 HANDleft also remained in our linear regression model.\nThus, our results help to further elucidate factors that contribute to inter-individual variability in LTP-like cortical plasticity. Moreover, they support the hypothesis of a compensatory increase in cortical plasticity in cognitively normal older adults that show, within a group of elderly individuals (List et al., 2011, 20113), lower white matter microstructural integrity.",

    "Brain structure and cortical physiology in the aging brain": {
      "text": "Age-related changes in brain structure are well documented, including not only an overall cortical atrophy due to aging (Fjell and Walhovd, 2010), but also a distinct pattern of cortical thinning involving predominantly the frontal and occipital lobes, with prominent atrophy of M1 (Salat et al., 2004). The latter may eventually lead to an increase in CCD in advancing age, as reported (albeit as a trend) in Freitas et al. (2011). With regard to neurophysiology in animal models, aging has been associated with a reduction in synaptic plasticity (Barnes 2003), which was even more pronounced in the presence of neurodegenerative disease (Battaglia et al., 2007). Using TMS-based neurophysiological measurements in humans, an age-related decrease of LTP-like cortical plasticity (Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008;Tecchio et al., 2008), with further reduction in older individuals with cognitive decline (Battaglia et al., 2007;Frantseva et al., 2008) has likewise been reported. Investigations of age-related modifications of cortical excitability, on the other hand, revealed conflicting results. Some studies showed an increase in rMT in healthy older compared to young individuals (McGinley et al., 2010;Rossini et al., 1992), whereas other studies reported no differences in rMT between different age groups (Oliviero et al., 2006;Pitcher et al., 2003). In the present study, we did not examine a control group of young subjects and therefore cannot directly address this question. However, over the (rather narrow) age range of our study, we did not observe associations between age and cortical excitability or LTPlike plasticity.\nMotor cortex and global cortical hyperexcitability has been shown in AD (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004;Rossini et al., 2007) and VAD (Pennisi et al., 2011), and may even correlate with cognitive decline in these conditions (Alagona et al., 2001;Bella et al., 2013;Khedr et al., 2011). As discussed above, increased cortical excitability in patients suffering from dementia may reflect a dysbalance of cortical transmitter systems following degeneration of cortical neurons and synapses. In fact, neuroimaging studies reported a widespread trend towards cortical thinning in virtually all parts of the brain in patients with AD (Lehmann et al., 2010), even though most pronounced in the parieto-occipital cortex (Ridgway et al., 2012). The ubiquitous impact of the neuropathological processes underlying AD onto the entire human brain is supported by neuropathological studies, which revealed AD-typical neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques also in the motor cortex, equivalent to other brain areas (Selden et al., 1998;Suvà et al., 1999).\nIn disease conditions like AD or VAD, cortical hyperexcitability and decreased LTP-like cortical plasticity might therefore be related to the degree of structural deterioration, as seen in the present study in our group of healthy older individuals. However, note that previous studies did not directly assess the association between cortical excitability and CT of specific cortical regions, but rather cortical excitability related to the neurodegenerative process of the entire brain. Our study is therefore the first to probe the association of cortical excitability with quantitative measures of microstructural integrity in cortical areas and the PT in healthy older subjects. We provide evidence that higher cortical excitability might be related to structural decline in cognitively (still) intact healthy older individuals.",

Furthermore, factors that might additionally contribute to inter-individual variability in rMT and LTP-like cortical plasticity, such as genetic polymorphisms in learning relevant genes (Cheeran et al., 2008;Witte et al., 2012), or cerebral perfusion (List et al., 2012) were not determined in our cohort.\nAlthough several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that changes in motor cortex physiology are associated with more general changes in brain function and plasticity, including cognitive functions (Battaglia et al., 2007;De Beaumont et al., 2011;Frantseva et al., 2008;List et al., 2011List et al., , 2012;;Witte et al., 2012), additional assessments of motor function and learning, possibly more directly reflecting changes in motor cortex physiology, should be included in future studies. To address the question whether rMT might serve as a biomarker for neurodegenerative changes, further multimodal longitudinal studies are required.\nNote also that the number of subjects investigated in this study was small, and we only included cognitively healthy individuals of a rather narrow age range. This might explain why we did not find associations between electrophysiological parameters and age.",

      "text": "We demonstrate that rMT and LTP-like plasticity may in part be explained by CT of the hand motor cortex and white matter fibre coherence of the PT in healthy older adults. Thus, the present study further contributes to elucidating inter-individual variability of TMS-based assessments of cortical physiology in humans.\nMoreover, our results indicate that higher cortical excitability, noted previously in patients with cortical atrophy and cognitive deficits due to AD, may already occur in healthy elderly individuals that show, within a group of elderly individuals, lower cortical thickness and learning ability. Thus, rMT might be a parameter to identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy, a hypothesis to be evaluated in future longitudinal studies.",

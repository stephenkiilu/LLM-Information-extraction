    "abstract": "The cognitive decline in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is assumed to be due to a cortical-subcortical disconnection secondary to damage to the cerebral white matter (WM). Using resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and analysis of the regional homogeneity (ReHo), we examined a group of CADASIL patients and a group of healthy subjects in order to: (1) explore possible differences between the two groups; and ( 2 ) to assess, in CADASIL patients, whether any ReHo abnormalities correlate with individual burdens of WM T 2 -weighted hyperintensity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived index of mean diffusivity (MD) of the cerebral WM, an index reflecting microstructural damage in CADASIL. METHODS: Twenty-three paucisymptomatic CADASIL patients (13 females; age mean  standard deviation  43.6  11.1 years; three symptomatic and 20 with no or few symptoms) and 16 healthy controls (nine females; age 46.6  11.0 years) were examined with T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery images, DTI, and rsfMRI. RESULTS: When compared to controls, CADASIL patients showed four clusters of significantly lower ReHo values in cortical areas belonging to networks involved in inhibition and attention, including the right insula, the left superior frontal gyrus, and the bilateral anterior cingulated cortex. ReHo changes did not correlate with an individual patients lesion burden or MD. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals decreased ReHo of rsfMRI signals in cortical areas involved in inhibition and attention processes, suggesting a potential role for these functional cortical changes in CADASIL.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common inherited brain small vessel disease (SVD). At a minimum, the prevalence of CADASIL has been estimated from two to five out of 100,000 people in the whole population, but the real prevalence is likely to be higher as the disorder is often underdiagnosed. 1 CADASIL is associated with missense mutations or, less frequently, deletions and insertions of NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19p13 which leads to the degeneration of smooth muscle cells and deposits of granular osmiophilic material in the basal membrane of the small arteries of the brain and other organstissues. 2 In CADASIL patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a leukoencephalopathy, appearing as hyperintensity in T 2 -weighted images, involving the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, brainstem and cerebellar white matter (WM), which is variably combined with lacunar infarcts, dilated perivascular spaces, and microbleeds in the areas with WM changes and in subcortical gray matter (GM) nuclei. 3 Moreover, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), given their high sensitivity to tissue properties, reveal that microstructural damage, appearing as areas of increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and mean diffusivity (MD) and of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), is also present in WM regions and subcortical GM nuclei exhibiting normal signals in T 2 -weighted images. 4567 In addition, MRI studies have revealed cortical GM damage in terms of decreased depth and surface area of cortical sulci which are partially correlated with the extent of subcortical lesions, the volume of lacunar lesions, and the mean ADC. 8 Finally, a 7 T MRI postmortem neuropathological study in a patient with CADASIL emphasized the presence of intracortical infarcts that were not visible on an in vivo 1.5 T MRI. 9 The most common clinical manifestations of CADASIL include migraine, transient ischemic attacks or strokes, psychiatric disorders, and progressive cognitive impairment leading to dementia. 3 In particular, behavioral studies in CADASIL patients reveal deficits in attention, cognitive control, executive functions, working memory, verbal abilities, and abstract concept formation. 10,11 Notably, some of these cognitive deficits are not correlated with major vascular events or with the severity of WM lesions, 11 being also observed in the very early phases of the disease. 10 Moreover, CADASIL patients suffer from depression and exhibit altered personality traits like disinhibition and impulsivity. 12,13 Several studies have reported a correlation between quantitative assessment of a variety of structural brain damage measurements and cognitive decline in CADASIL gene carriers. The former include the overall burden of lacunar infarcts, 14,15 brain atrophy, 8,16 thinning of the corpus callosum, 17 severity or extent of WM or thalamic damage evaluated in T 2 -weighted or diffusion tensor images, 4,6,7,181920 the number and continuity of lenticulostriate arteries, 21 and deep gray matter (GM) iron deposition. 22 Functional MRI (fMRI), exploiting the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast, is sensitive to hemodynamic changes and has been applied to CADASIL patients during the execution of motor, 23,24 visual 23 and cognitive 25 tasks. In CADASIL patients versus controls, these revealed an increased BOLD amplitude response in the visual cortex during a visual stimulus but not in the motor cortex during a motor task, 23 more frequent bilateral activation of the motor cortex during a simple motor task, 24 and a lower BOLD amplitude response in the cerebral regions belonging to the alerting network, the lower brainstem and the left cerebellum when the proactive inhibition during a GoNoGo cognitive task was analyzed. 25 Some inconsistency in the fMRI results during the task execution may be due to a number of reasons including different MR equipment, 26,27 task selection, and variable patient compliance and capability to correctly perform the task. 28 Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) may overcome these issues. 29 Analysis with a regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach of rsfMRI data is based on the assumption that the rsfMRI time series would be synchronous within functionally active and connected areas. 30 The ReHo approach has been applied to the analysis of rsfMRI in several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cerebral cortical alterations, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 31,32 Alzheimers disease (AD), 31 Parkinsons disease (PD), 33 multiple system atrophy 34 and to diseases of the cerebral WM including elderly MCI patients with sporadic SVD and leukoencephalopathy. 35 In the present investigation, we performed an rsfMRI study using the ReHo approach in a group of paucisymptomatic CADASIL patients and in a group of healthy control subjects. There were two aims in this study: (1) to explore any possible differences in the ReHo between CADASIL patients and age-and gender-matched controls; (2) to assess whether, in CADASIL patients, functional ReHo abnormalities correlated with objective measurements of the extension of WM T 2 -weighted hyperintensity and DTI-derived index of MD of whole WM, as an expression of microstructural damage.",

    "Methods Subjects": {
      "text": "Twenty-three subjects with genetically proven CADASIL (10 males, 13 females; age mean  standard deviation  43.6  11.7 years) and 16 healthy controls (seven males, nine females; age mean  standard deviation  46.6  11.1 years) were enrolled in this study.\nTo be included, patients had to have a CADASIL diagnosis based on genetic findings of the typical NOTCH3 mutations, and no MRI contraindications. Except for the 3 patients who came to our attention because of their symptoms, 20 patients underwent the genetic test because they were family members of affected patients and were in the early phases of the disease, presenting no or few symptoms such as migraine. The healthy controls were recruited from personnel attending the MRI unit and from their family members and friends. To be included, the healthy controls had to satisfy the following criteria: no history of neurological diseases, a normal neurological examination, and no MRI contraindications. Participants were further screened on preliminary MRI sequences to ensure that no structural brain abnormalities were detected. All participants were right-handed. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, in conformity with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local ethics committee.\nThe distribution of the demographic and clinical characteristics in the CADASIL and controls groups, as well as the between-group comparisons, is shown in Table 1. No significant differences in age (P  .40 at a Mann-Whitney U test), years of education (P  .52 at a Mann Whitney U test) or gender (P  .96 at a χ 2 test) between the two groups were revealed. Among the clinical features, CADASIL patients showed a statistically significant higher rate of a family history involving at least one of the typical disturbances (headache, transient ischemic attackstroke, cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbances) (P  .01 at a χ 2 test) and psychiatric disturbances (P  .004 at a χ 2 test) compared to the control group.",

Briefly, we corrected diffusion-weighted images for head motion and eddy current distortions using FDT tool (FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox 2.0), part of FSL and removed the skull using the FSL brain extraction tool. The b-matrix was reoriented by application of the rotational part of the affine transformation employed in the head motion and eddy current correction procedure. Then, a tensor model was fitted to processed DWI data using the RESTORE diffusion tensor estimation 39 implemented in the CAMINO package. 40 The diffusion tensor is described by three eigenvectors and relevant eigenvalues λ 1 , λ 2, and λ 3, and various rotationally invariant DTI indices can be derived. In this study, we selected the median value of the WM MD, which quantifies the diffusivity of water molecules independently of direction 41 and correlated with the extension and severity of the microstructural damage in CADASIL 5 and sporadic SVD leukoencephalopathy. 42434445 Accordingly, in all subjects, we computed the MD map using DTI-TK version 2.3.1 46 and FSL tools. Then, the b 0 and T 1 -weighted images were co-registered using 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) affine transformation using FLIRT, and this transformation was then applied to the MD map (Fig 1). After that, each MD map was masked by the WM segmentation mask in the T 1 -weighted space, and the median value of the WM MD map was computed using MATLAB scripts (R2014b, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA).",

    "Lesion Burden": {
      "text": "For each subject, the WM lesions were analyzed by using the lesionBrain pipeline included in volBrain, an online MRI brain volumetry system. 47 The lesionBrain pipeline is able to automatically and accurately segment WM lesions from T 1 -weighted and FLAIR images, combining several complementary patch-based approaches 48 to calculate the lesion burden, expressed as the ratio between the lesions volume and the WM volume (Fig 1). rsfMRI Processing rsfMRI volumes were analyzed using FSL. Canonical preprocessing of rsfMRI data was applied including the removal of the first five time points, slice-time correction with custom timings, motion correction using MCFLIRT, and intensity normalization by a single scaling factor. To check for possible excessive head motion, the absolute displacement of each time point with respect to the reference image (ie, the middle-time point rsfMRI image) was calculated and assessed as being smaller than 1.5 mm (half voxel size) for each subject.\nSubjects T 1 -weighted images were co-registered to the MNI152 standard-space brain at 2 mm with an affine trans-formation (12 DOF), followed by a nonlinear transformation using FNIRT. Co-registration of rsfMRI images to the individual high resolution T 1 -weighted image was carried out using a 6 DOF registration with FLIRT.\nReHo was calculated in the native rsfMRI space using the Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit version 1.8, 49 after applying low-pass filtering at 0.08 Hz to the fMRI time series. To preserve the contribution from very low frequencies, no high-pass filter was applied. 49 ReHo maps were computed using the Kendall coefficient of concordance within a 27-voxel cubic neighborhood. 30 For a given voxel, a high ReHo value implies high local synchronization of the 27 neighboring voxels BOLD signals. Each individual ReHo map was transformed into a standard Z-value map by subtracting the global mean and dividing by the standard deviation within the subject brain mask, obtained using BET (with a fractional intensity threshold of 0.45), and normalized to the MNI152 standard-space using the transformations previously computed.\nTo establish group differences in Z-transformed ReHo values, we investigated significant between-group positive and negative statistics using an unpaired t-test within the general linear model (GLM) framework. Age and gender were included in the design matrix as nuisance covariates.\nIn order to test for significant linear relations between structural and functional indices in CADASIL patients, a regression analysis was set for the lesion burden and median of the MD as independent variables and Z-transformed ReHo values as the dependent variable. Age and gender were included in the design matrix as nuisance covariates. For each GLM contrast, P-values employing permutation-based statistics (1,000 permutations) were calculated and corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold-free cluster enhancement. 50 A P-value of .05, corrected for multiple comparisons across space (family-wise error rate correction) was considered statistically significant. All group analyses were performed in the MNI152 standardspace T 1 -weighted template. To anatomically map the significant clusters in the resulting Z statistic images, we employed the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases. 51",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In our study, rsfMRI in CADASIL patients revealed a decreased ReHo of the BOLD signal in cortical areas which are involved in the inhibition and attention processes, including the right insular cortex, the left superior frontal gyrus, and the bilateral anterior cingulated gyrus. These functional changes did not correlate with the extension and severity of the WM damage assessed by T 2 -weighted FLAIR imaging and DTI, respectively.\nTo date, one study has evaluated patients with sporadic early SVD, 52 and two studies have evaluated CADASIL patients using rsfMRI. 53,54 Schaefer et al, 52 by evaluating eigenvector centrality, have observed reduced connectivity in frontoparietal networks and increased connectivity in the cerebellum of patients with sporadic early SVD when compared to healthy controls. In the former patients, the functional changes were correlated with an extension of WM lesions assessed with a semiquantitative visual scale and with the typical neuropsychological deficits. Cullen et al, 53 using independent component analysis, have correlated rsfMRI data in the intrinsic attentionalexecutive networks with computation of an extension of T 2 hyperintensity of the cerebral WM and of the volume of lacunes, and with cognitive performance in CADASIL patients. By modeling a path between structural measures and cognitive performance, they have observed a mediation effect for the association between normalized lacune volume, but not of WM T 2 hyperintensity and trail making B minus A time. Su et al 54 have measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in rsfMRI and used a semiquantitative visual scale to rate the extension of T 2 hyperintensity of the WM in CADASIL patients and healthy controls. Patients with CADASIL exhibited significantly lower ALFF values in the right precuneus and cuneus and higher ALFF values in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus and left cerebellar anterior and posterior lobes. Moreover, CADASIL patients showed weaker functional connectivity between the areas with abnormal ALFF and other brain areas. The changes in ALFF did not correlate with the semiquantitative visual assessment of the T 2 hyperintense WM, but correlated with comprehensive measurements of cognitive deficit.\nOur data differ from those of the above studies in several aspects. Firstly, we have used a different method for assessment of rsfMRI data, namely the ReHo analysis. Secondly, we have correlated ReHo data with quantitative measurements of both macro and microstructural damage as revealed by FLAIR and DTI, respectively. In particular, no study to date has utilized DTI which can provide more sensitive indexes that reflect the extentseverity of both macroscopic and microscopic changes.\nOther possible sources of heterogeneity include the variable severity of clinical and WM damage in the samples examined. Here, we have investigated pauci or asymptomatic CADASIL patients with a moderate extension of T 2 WM hyperintensity of the WM as reflected in a mean Fazekas scale score of 3. The patients with sporadic early SVD examined by Schaefer et al 52 were labeled as early and showed a moderate extension of T 2 WM hyperintensity as reflected in an age-related WM change score 2. Half of the patients investigated by Cullen et al 53 had a history of strokes or TIA, of whom about 20 had moderate or severe disability, and the average normalized subcortical hyperintensity volume was 6.9. Finally, the patients investigated by Su et al 54 were older than ours, had prior strokes or TIA more frequently, but at the same time had a mean Montreal cognitive assessment score and Fazekas scale scores similar to those in our sample.\nThe functional anatomy of the cortical areas showing significantly lower Z-transformed ReHo values in our CADASIL patients (including the bilateral anterior cingulated gyrus, the right insula, and the left superior frontal gyrus), is noteworthy and enables us to submit the following potentially unifying interpretation of the significance of this finding. In fact, the anterior cingulated cortex and the right insular cortex are core regions of the alerting network involved in proactive inhibitory processes. 55,56 In particular, they are assumed to act as a node of an alerting system that detects salient events and promotes the efficiency of proactive processes. 575859 The left superior frontal gyrus, in its turn, is crucial for the inhibitory component of the proactive inhibition process. 60 While behavioral, neurophysiological, and fMRI studies in healthy subjects have revealed a consistent association between the impulsivity trait of personality and the proactive inhibitory processes, 55,61,62 it is remarkable that CADASIL patients, besides showing depression and apathy, also show altered personality traits including disinhibition and impulsivity. 12,13,63 Thus, the shared membership in the proactive inhibitory network of regions showing a lower ReHo in our CADASIL patients suggests that this functional change may reflect the personality trait or abnormal accentuation of impulsiveness observed in CADASIL. Interestingly, in a rsfMRI study, 64 depression was also reported to be associated with reduced activity in some of these regions. Admittedly, our results do not allow us to determine whether altered ReHo in CADASIL is associated with impulsivity or depression behaviors. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the modifications of the regional BOLD in the resting state might be associated with psychopathological features in CADASIL patients with no or few symptoms.\nIt has also been postulated that cognitive impairment commonly observed in sporadic SVD associated leukoencephalopathy in the elderly 65,66 and in CADASIL 7,53 is due to cortical disconnection secondary to diffuse WM and subcortical GM damage. In our study, we failed to observe any correlation between functional changes and quantitative assessment of both the T 2 hyperintense lesion load and the DTI-derived index of microstructural damage. This result differs from those reported by Schaefer et al 52 and Cullen et al, 53 but is in line with that of Su et al, 54 and might indicate that ReHo allows detection of subtle cortical functional changes with a network distribution correlated with some psychopathological features of CADASIL.\nWe recognize the following limitations of our study. We performed a single-center study on a small sample. There is a broad, general limitation on the way in which BOLD fMRI results in CADASIL patients are interpreted. Due to underlying SVD, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent decreased BOLD reflects decreased regional tissue blood flow or intrinsic functional changes of the cerebral cortex. 25 We did not evaluate our patients with neuropsychological tests exploring the inhibitory and attention functions. There is little doubt that an increase in rsfMRI acquisition time and the use of a higher number of diffusion weighting gradient directions as well as higher number of signal acquisitions would have further improved the quality of our data. Finally, we did not perform tractography of the WM subserving the cortical areas showing decreased ReHo.\nIn conclusion, in paucisymptomotic CADASIL patients, rsfMRI demonstrates a decreased ReHo of BOLD signal in the cortical area involved in inhibition and attention processes, suggesting a potential role for these functional cortical changes in CADASIL.",

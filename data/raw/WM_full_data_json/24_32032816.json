    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by alpha-synuclein protein deposition with variable degree of concurrent Alzheimers pathology. Neuroinflammation is also increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to degeneration. We aimed to examine the relationship between microglial activation as measured with  11 C-PK11195 brain PET, MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and grey matter atrophy in DLB. Nineteen clinically probable DLB and 20 similarly aged controls underwent 3T structural MRI (T1-weighted) and diffusionweighted imaging. Eighteen DLB subjects also underwent  11 C-PK11195 PET imaging and 15 had  11 C-Pittsburgh compound B amyloid PET, resulting in 915 being amyloid-positive. We used Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) for volume-based morphometry (VBM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) for DTI to assess group comparisons between DLB and controls and to identify associations of  11 C-PK11195 binding with greywhite matter changes and cognitive score in DLB patients. VBM analyses showed that DLB had extensive reduction of grey matter volume in superior frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices (familywise error (FWE)-corrected p  0.05). TBSS showed widespread changes in DLB for all DTI parameters (reduced fractional anisotropy, increased diffusivity), involving the corpus callosum, corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus (FWE-corrected p  0.05). Higher  11 C-PK11195 binding in parietal cortices correlated with widespread lower mean and radial diffusivity in DLB patients (FWE-corrected p  0.05). Furthermore, preserved cognition in DLB (higher Addenbrookes Cognitive Evaluation revised score) also correlated with higher  11 C-PK11195 binding in frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. However, microglial activation was not significantly associated with grey matter changes. Our study suggests that increased microglial activation is associated with a relative preservation of white matter and cognition in DLB, positioning neuroinflammation as a potential early marker of DLB etio-pathogenesis.",

      "text": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second-leading degenerative dementia in older people (Vann Jones and OBrien, 2014). It is characterized by alpha-synuclein protein deposition in the form of intra-neuronal Lewy bodies as well as Lewy neurites, with a variable degree of concurrent Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology (Spillantini et al., 1997;Gomperts, 2016). Neuroinflammation and, https:doi.org10.1016j.nicl.2020.102200 Received 30 October 2019; Received in revised form 26 January 2020; Accepted 27 January 2020 more specifically microglial activation, is increasingly recognized as a key etio-pathogenic mechanism in DLB which can be assessed in vivo via different PET tracers including  11 C-PK11195 (PK11195) (Turkheimer et al., 2007). In DLB, increased microglial activation as assessed via PK11195 has been observed in the striatum, substantia nigra, and several cortical regions (Iannaccone et al., 2013;Surendranathan et al., 2018). Intriguingly, we have recently found that patients with cognitively mild forms of DLB have higher PK11195 binding than those with moderate cognitive impairment in the caudate, thalamus as well as frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (Surendranathan et al., 2018). Other studies have also shown that microglial activation is an initial event in AD, mirroring the neuropathological changes primarily involving temporo-parietal regions (Hamelin et al., 2016;Passamonti et al., 2018). In addition, longitudinal data regarding neuroinflammation activation in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have shown a decreased microglial activation at 14month follow-up (Fan et al., 2017). Increased microglial activation in MCI was also associated with a preserved hippocampal volume (Femminella et al., 2019). Together, these results suggest that neuroinflammation represents an early event in the neurodegeneration process and could be a potential therapeutic target in dementia. In fact, unlike molecules targeting protein accumulation which are currently at an experimental stage, anti-inflammatory drugs are readily available and could be employed more quickly into clinical drug trials. An important prerequisite for such an endeavour is a better understanding of the temporal ordering and clinical relevance of protein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and structural brain changes.\nWhite matter microstructure has received growing research attention as a sensitive marker for early structural brain changes. Diffusiontensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to Brownian motion of water molecules, from which microstructural features and associated pathological processes can be inferred from the relative coherence or magnitude of diffusion along the major axis of a white matter bundle. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar index (range: 0-1) reflecting the directional coherence of water diffusion. Mean diffusivity (MD) represents the overall magnitude of diffusion and is widely thought to be sensitive to cell loss, cellularity, edema and necrosis (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996;Alexander et al., 2007). A less commonly studied marker is radial diffusivity (RD), which has been linked to demyelination as well as pathological changes in axonal density (Klawiter et al., 2011). The literature has consistently shown reduced FA and increased MDRD in DLB, especially in the absence of the marked brain atrophy that is typically seen in late-onset AD (Kantarci et al., 2010;Watson et al., 2012;Nedelska et al., 2015). Several pathological mechanisms for such white matter changes have been described in dementia, including ischaemia, demyelination and amyoid angiopathy (Gold et al., 2012;Chao et al., 2013;Kantarci et al., 2017). In addition to white matter changes secondary to grey matter atrophy and amyloid burden (i.e. Wallerian degeneration) (Amlien and Fjell, 2014), several other contributors such as vascular damage and tau deposition can contribute to primary white matter changes, especially in late-myelinated projection fibers (Bartzokis et al., 2007).\nIn the present study, we aimed to characterize the relationship between microglial activation as measured with PK11195 PET and DTI impairment in a cross-sectional group of subjects with probable DLB, most of which having amyloid status additionally confirmed through PiB PET imaging (Surendranathan et al., 2018). We recently observed that DLB subjects with a milder cognitive impairment had widespread higher cortical PK11195 binding. In addition, recent studies in MCI suggest an early peak of microglial activation in MCI. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher microglial activation would correlate with a relative preservation of white matter microstructural integrity.",

      "text": "The present work is part of the Neuroimaging of Inflammation in MemoRy and Other Disorders (NIMROD) study (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017). All participants were aged over 50 years and had sufficient proficiency in English for cognitive testing. We included 19 participants with probable DLB according to both 2005 and 2017 consensus criteria (McKeith et al., 2005;McKeith et al., 2017) as described in (Surendranathan et al., 2018). In addition, subjects had at least two years clinical follow-up to confirm clinical progression and no change of diagnosis. We also recruited 20 similarly aged healthy controls, with MMSE scores greater than 26, absence of regular memory complaints, and no unstable or significant medical illnesses. A detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessment was performed (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017). This included Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised test (ACE-R) which is a 100-point test incorporating five key cognitive domains in dementia disorders (orientationattention, memory, verbal fluency, language, and visuo-spatial) (Mioshi et al., 2006).\nPatients were identified from the Memory clinic at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, other local memory clinics, and from the Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN) volunteer registers. Healthy controls were recruited via DeNDRoN as well as from spouses and partners of participants. Informed written consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study received a favourable opinion from the East of England Ethics Committee (Cambridge Central Research, Ref. 13EE0104).",

      "text": "Nineteen subjects with probable DLB underwent multi-modal 3T MPRAGE and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as described in detail below. 1819 DLB participants also had  11 C-PK11195 PET imaging on a GE Advance or GE Discovery 690 PETCT scanner. To ensure accurate correlations between MRI and PET imaging, we aimed at keeping scan interval between MRI and PET within 3 months (mean interval 2.4 months). Each  11 C-PK11195 PET image series was aligned across the time frames with SPM12 to ameliorate the impact of head motion during data acquisition. The realigned dynamic PET images were coregistered to the corresponding T1-weighted MPRAGE images, as were regions of interest (ROIs) from the Hammers atlas (Hammers et al., 2003) using ANTs for the inverse spatial normalisation from MNI to MPRAGE space. Prior to kinetic modelling, regional time-activity curves (TACs) were corrected for CSF contamination through division by the mean ROI fraction of grey plus white matter, using SPM12 tissue probability maps smoothed to PET spatial resolution. Binding in each ROI was quantified using non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND ) determined with reference tissue TAC estimation from supervised cluster analysis and a simplified reference tissue model incorporating vascular binding correction (Yaqub et al., 2012). In fact, the partial volume correction method applied to the dynamic PK11195 images to address differential atrophy is the two-compartment (brain, CSF) Meltzer method, which has been shown to be more robust to registration and segmentation errors than the three-compartment version. Furthermore, this method is well suited to the production of the PK11195 reference time activity curve from supervised cluster analysis (SCA), whereas the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) approach cannot be applied given that SCA is a voxel-wise technique.\nFor each subject, we derived a composite PK11195 BP ND (global) by averaging the PK11195 binding across each cortical ROI and hemisphere from the Hammers atlas, as well as lobar PK11195 BP ND (i.e., frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital). In addition, 15 DLB subjects underwent  11 C-PiB PET imaging to quantify the density of fibrillar Aβ deposits for classification of Aβ status (positive when PiB cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)  1.5) (Jagust et al., 2010).\n11 C-PiB data were quantified using SUVR with the superior cerebellar grey matter as the reference region. The  11 C-PiB SUVR data were subjected to the GTM technique using Freesurfers PETsurfer (Greve et al., 2014), including partial volume correction.",

      "text": "Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was implemented in the FSL workspace to align each subjects FA image to a pre-identified target FA image (FMRIB_58) (Smith et al., 2004). All aligned FA images were then affine-registered into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) MNI152 template. The mean FA and skeleton were created for all subjects and each FA image was then projected onto the skeleton. The skeleton was thresholded at FA value of 0.2 to include white matter tracts that are common across all subjects, as well as to further exclude voxels that may contain grey matter or CSF. The aligned DTI parameter map of each subject was then projected onto the mean skeleton. In addition, other DTI parameters were aligned by applying the original FA non-linear spatial transformations to the corresponding datasets and projecting them onto the mean FA skeleton. Subsequently, the randomise function in FSL was implemented to identify group differences in DTI parameters between DLB and age-matched healthy controls, using a two-sample t-test while controlling for age and sex. VBM group comparisons between DLB and Controls were performed using the TFCE toolbox with non-parametric randomisation (n  5000 permutations) and family-wise error (FWE)-corrected two-tailed p  0.05 threshold, with age, sex and total intracranial volume as covariates.\nVoxel-wise correlation between DTI and PK11195 was performed with TBSS using age, sex, scan interval between MRI and PET imaging, as well as ACER score as nuisance covariates in the design matrix. Global and lobar PK11195 uptake was treated as the independent variable for each DTI parameter across the white matter skeleton. The statistical significance from these tests was determined using nonparametric permutation testing (n  5000 permutations) and adjusted for multiple comparisons FWE correction and using two-tailed p  0.05 significance threshold (Smith and Nichols, 2009), thus obviating the need to set an arbitrary cluster threshold. Anatomical definitions of significant TBSS clusters were performed visually and facilitated using the John Hopkins -ICBM white matter atlas, available as part of the FSL package. Finally, the statistical maps were dilated with tbss_fill function for visualisation purposes. Similarly, voxelwise VBM correlational maps with globallobar PK11195 were obtained for DLB subjects, using the same covariates as for DTI correlations (in addition to total intracranial volume). False-discovery rate (FDR) p  0.05 was used as a significance threshold.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, we found evidence of relative DTI preservation for DLB in relation to increased microglial activation as measured with PK11195. This is consistent with our previous data showing that neuroinflammation in fronto-temporo-parietal cortices was more prominent in DLB subjects with milder cognitive impairment, suggesting that central inflammation plays a pivotal role in the early stages of the disease (Surendranathan et al., 2018). No such correlation (either negative or positive) was observed between grey matter volume and PK11195 binding -microglial activation does not decrease in relation to grey matter atrophy and conversely, increased neuroinflammation is not directly related to preserved grey matter volume.\nExtensive grey and white matter abnormalities were observed in DLB compared to healthy controls. Patients exhibited grey matter atrophy in extensive frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices (Fig. 2), while DTI changes were observed in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus and left cingulum (Fig. 1), which is in keeping with previous studies (Firbank et al., 2007;Kantarci et al., 2010;Watson et al., 2012;Delli Pizzi et al., 2015;Firbank et al., 2016). Subgroup analyses according to the PiB status showed that PiB DLB subjects had more extensive DTI changes, encompassing virtually every tract of the white matter skeleton. Most likely due to a small sample size, we did not find any significant DTI difference between PiB and PiB-DLB subjects. Interestingly, previous studies showed altered DTI metrics in parietal and occipital white matter tracts in DLB, irrespective of the amyloid load (Nedelska et al., 2015).\nStudies in AD report that white matter changes can occur secondarily to grey matter damage (Wallerian degeneration) (Amlien and Fjell, 2014) following amyloid accumulation in soluble oligomers or plaques. Cell death will lead to axonal disruption in white matter tracts connecting the affected cortical areas. However, there is also evidence of primary white matter changes, which can be attributed to vascular damage or hyperphosphorylated tau deposition, resulting in the formation of paired helical filaments primarily affecting the axons. The retrogenesis hypothesis stipulates that primary white matter degeneration follows an inverse path than what is observed during myelogenesis, i.e., early-myelinated large-diameter fibres are affected last, while late-myelinated projecting fibres shown early disruption (Bartzokis et al., 2007). Longitudinal DTI studies accounting for tau deposition and vascular burden are warranted to disentangle primary and secondary white matter changes in dementias.\nIn the present study, we also observed that higher parietal PK11195 binding was correlated with relative DTI preservation (i.e., lower diffusivity) in the corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus, i.e., the same tracts which are impaired in DLB compared to controls (Fig. 3). Thus, the spatial congruence of both statistical maps -subjected to the same rigorous statistical thresholdsconfer support for the view that white matter deficits may be a secondary event to various processes such as protein deposition and possibly neuroinflammation. In addition, we observed a broad overlap between the findings of MD and RD parameters regarding the correlation of DTI values and PK11195 binding. Higher MD values indicate increased diffusion, suggesting tissue breakdown and increased brain water content. Conversely, higher RD is considered as a more specific marker of myelin damage (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996;Song et al., 2005). As previously reported, MD (and RD) appears as a more sensitive proxy of white matter damage than FA in patients with DLB (Watson et al., 2012;ODonovan et al., 2014;Delli Pizzi et al., 2015).\nWhereas lower MD and RD DTI values are related to higher parietal PK11195, the analyses did not reach statistical significance for PK11195 binding in the other lobes, although we observed a trend for temporal lobe (p  0.08). Considering this is a cross-sectional study, one could only speculate about the reasons why parietal PK11195 is more closely related to DTI preservation than the other brain regions. We can hypothesize that the dynamic changes in parietal PK11195 are temporally more related to DTI changes, possibly as parietal PK11195 is decreasing simultaneously with appearing white matter changes. In fact, we observed that PK11195 binding in the parietal lobe was significantly lower compared to the frontal and occipital lobes.\nStudies using TSPO PET ligands in degenerative conditions have reported conflicting results about the trajectory of microglial activation. One hypothesis suggests that neuroinflammation is more prominent at earlier stages of degenerative conditions. In fact, Femminella et al. (Femminella et al., 2019) showed that increased microglial activation as measured with  11 C-PBR28 PET in MCI subjects was associated with higher grey matter and hippocampal volume. Similarly, Hamelin et al. (Hamelin et al., 2016) observed that higher TSPO binding (using 18 F-DPA-714) was positively correlated with higher MMSE and larger grey matter volume in AD. Moreover, a recent study in a transgenic amyloid mouse model (Blume et al., 2018) using longitudinal TSPO and amyloid PET showed that microglial response declined relative to increasing amyloidosis, possibly due to a saturation effect. Interestingly, while our results suggest that increased TSPO binding is directly related to lower diffusivity, no such relationship could be established between PK11195 binding and grey matter volume. These findings are crucial as they suggest that decreased microglial activation with progressive impairment of DTI metrics and cognition is not secondary to grey matter atrophy.\nAs discussed in a recent meta-analysis (Bradburn et al., 2019), the predominant hypothesis posits that neuroinflammation peaks early in MCI, followed by a second peak when MCI convert to AD, possibly reflecting the complex relationship between microglial activation and protein deposition internalized by glia (Fan et al., 2017). Therefore, our observations in DLB suggest a different pattern of microglial activation in dementias compared to primary inflammatory conditions, where TSPO ligand changes are more related to clinical relapses, as this is the case in multiple sclerosis (Rissanen et al., 2018).\nRegarding the relationship between amyloid load and PK11195 binding, we did not observe any significant correlation between lobar or global PiB SUVR and PK11195 BP ND , suggesting that amyloid load is not a major driver of neuroinflammation in DLB, or that any such relationship is weak. These findings are in contrast with those observed in AD (Fan et al., 2015).\nThe present study is not without limitations. First, our results have been obtained on a relatively modest sample of subjects with DLB, so this would require confirmation in larger samples, especially since we found a trend between higher microglial activation in the temporal lobe and DTI preservation. In addition, while subgroup analyses based on the amyloid status would certainly be of interest, our small sample impeded us to assess whether concurrent AD pathology might play an additional role in the complex relationship between neuroinflammation and white matter tracts integrity. Second, the present study was based on data obtained with a cross-sectional design. Therefore, longitudinal data is required to fully assess the spatial and temporal interplay between white matter integrity and neuroinflammation in DLB. If on the one hand, white matter degeneration can be considered as an early structural marker in neurodegenerative disorders, it can be equally possible that neuroinflammation precipitates white matter damage and thus represents a relatively upstream event in the cascade leading to cellular loss in DLB. In addition, we must acknowledge that there was a larger male distribution in the DLB group (1519 versus 1020 for Controls, p  0.06) and although we used sex as a covariate for our correlational analyses, we cannot exclude that sex might play a role in DTI integrity. In fact, Kumar et al. showed that females had a lower myelin and fiber integrity in limbic and cerebellar regions, while males had lower values in frontal and temporal areas (Kumar et al., 2013). Additionally, we are not aware of a different microglial activation based on sex.\nThe use of PK11195 targeting translocator protein (TSPO) cannot fully represent the extent of central inflammation which is determined by several other factors over and above microglial activation. In fact, other targets such as astrocyte activation should be assessed as they also may play a role in the development of neurodegeneration (Stefaniak and OBrien, 2016). In addition, PK11195, as a first generation TSPO ligand, has shown lower sensitivity compared to second generation tracers. However, PK11195 has the advantage of not being affected by the genetic polymorphism (notably rs6971 single nucleotide) altering the binding of second-generation ligands (Owen et al., 2012).\nFinally, although TBSS is a widely used DTI analysis software, inherent limitations must be acknowledged, e.g. the fact that the projection of the common white matter skeleton is based on FA maps rather than tensor-based. In addition, the registration target was performed on the FMRIB58 skeleton (as recommended by FSL) rather than on a study-specific skeleton (Bach et al., 2014). In addition, we must acknowledge that the tensor model used in the present study does not address the issue of crossing fibres, which can represent 70 of the configuration of white matter fibres. More sophisticated models, including diffusion and fibre orientation density stand as a more effective way to describe the complex organisation of white matter tracts (DellAcqua and Tournier, 2019).\nIn conclusion, we present novel evidence of the in vivo association between lower DTI diffusivity and increased microglial activation in DLB. Future longitudinal studies are required to determine whether the early presence of neuroinflammation in DLB recedes and mediates the structural brain abnormalities that we have observed.",

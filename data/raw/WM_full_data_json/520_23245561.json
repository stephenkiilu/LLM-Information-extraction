    "abstract": "Background-Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising method for identifying significant cross-sectional differences of white-matter tracts in normal controls (NC) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease (AD). There have not been many studies establishing its longitudinal utility. Methods-Seventy-five participants (25 NC, 25 amnestic MCI, and 25 AD) had 3-Tesla MRI scans and clinical evaluations at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were analyzed at each time-point and longitudinally in eight a prioriselected areas taken from four regions of interest (ROIs). Results-Cross-sectionally, MD values were higher, and FA values lower in the fornix and splenium of the AD group compared with either MCI or NC (P  .01).Within-group change was more evident in MD than in FA over 12 months: MD increased in the inferior, anterior cingulum, and fornix in both the MCI and AD groups (P  .01). Conclusions-There were stable, cross-sectional, region-specific differences between the NC and AD groups in both FA and MD at each time-point over 12 months. Longitudinally, MD was a better indicator of change than FA. Significant increases of fornix MD in the MCI group suggest this is an early indicator of progression.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, currently affects an estimated 5.4 million Americans and this number is expected to double every 20 years 1. Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at a higher risk for progressing to AD and, as such, MCI is considered to be a prodromal stage 2345. The standard of assessment and diagnosis of both MCI and AD remains based on clinical grounds. The recently revised National Institute on Aging and Alzheimers Association criteria for the diagnosis of MCI and AD, in research, place new emphasis on biomarkers of AD pathophysiology 678910. Although the use of biomarkers for an MCI or AD diagnosis may be considered a major step forward, there is a need for continued development of accurate and reliable technologies with longitudinal utility for prognosis or use in disease-modifying treatment trials.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of measuring white-matter (WM) integrity when conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has insufficient contrast to delineate WM fiber tract organization 111213. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are two DTI measures used to quantify the integrity of WM microstructure by measuring the relative random motion of water in cerebral tissue. These measures are reported in scalar values. Higher values of FA and lower values of MD are thought to represent normal tissue cytoarchitecture where the random motion of water along a healthy axon, for example, is tightly constrained and restricted to movement in one direction (anisotropic). FA and MD measures do not necessarily correlate, but are complementary in determining WM tract integrity. In select brain regions, both measures have been shown to differ between cognitively normal controls (NC) and persons with AD and MCI. One study reported lower FA in MCI and AD groups compared with NC in areas posterior to the anterior commissure and corresponding to corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections through the internal capsule 14. Others have found lower FA and higher MD in subjects with AD compared with NC in the cingulum bundle 15161718 frontotemporal areas, cortical regions 16,17,192021, and the splenium of the corpus callosum 19,22232425. Fewer studies have investigated WM changes in MCI 5,26. Compared with NCs, MCI patients had significant FA and MD differences in multiple cortical regions 16,21, the splenium of the corpus callosum 21,27, and the cingulum bundle 28.\nIn an earlier study we examined cross-sectional changes in the WM of eight a prioriselected regions of interest (ROIs) at baseline and 3 months later 29. There were significant cross-sectional differences in fiber tract integrity (reduced FA) in the fornix, anterior cingulum, and splenium when comparing NCs to MCI or AD patients. Over a 3month follow-up interval, during which participants remained clinically stable, FA in the anterior cingulum changed more inMCI compared with NCs, but not in AD patients. Although these results were informative, longer DTI follow-up studies are needed to fully characterize longitudinal WM changes and to determine the stability of the cross-sectional findings over time. To date, there has been only one longitudinal study of WM structure in NC compared with MCI patients 30. FA reductions, predominantly in the corpus callosum, were reported over 13-16 months, during which time both groups remained clinically stable. MD was not examined in that study.\nThe present study builds on these findings by examining longitudinal DTI changes in NC, MCI, and AD using both FA and MD as indicators of WM integrity. We hypothesized a priori that the significant cross-sectional FA and MD differences between diagnostic groups observed at 0 and 3 months would remain at 6 and 12 months in the same regions. Further, we expected that longitudinal changes in FA and MD over 12 months would be most apparent in the MCI and AD groups in the fornix, anterior cingulum, and splenium.",

Study methods have been detailed elsewhere 29. Briefly, participants were recruited through the clinical core of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimers Disease Research Center and evaluated comprehensively (including an extensive neuropsychologic battery). Control (NC) participants were cognitively normal and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 31,32 of 0. Participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) did not have dementia, had mild memory problems, a CDR 5 0.5, and met Mayo criteria for amnestic MCI, in single or multiple domains 26. Mild AD participants had a CDR 5 1 and met NINCDSADRDA criteria for probable AD 33. All participants were 55 years of age, had no history of a neuropsychiatric disease other than AD, and had an informant who could provide information about their daily function. Informed consent was obtained prior to initiation of the study in accordance with the institutional review board requirements of Johns Hopkins. Consent procedures followed the guidelines endorsed by the Alzheimers Association for participation of cognitively impaired individuals 34.",

Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. At each scanning session, both magnetization prepared rapid gradient recalled echo (MPRAGE) and DTI scans were obtained. DTI images were acquired using a SENSE head coil on a 3T Philips MRI scanner equipped with dual-quasar gradients (up to 80 mTm). A single-shot spin-echo-echoplanar sequence (SE-EPI) was used with diffusion gradients applied in 32 noncollinear directions and where b  700 smm 2 . Five additional reference images with least diffusion weighting (b  33 smm 2 ) were also obtained. Fifty-sixty axial slices were acquired to cover all cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, parallel to the AC-PC line. The field of view, size of acquisition matrix, and slice thickness were 212  212 mm, 96  96, and 2.2 mm, respectively. Other imaging parameters included TR  7000 ms, TE  80 ms, and SENSE reduction factor  2.5. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, two datasets were acquired, leading to a total acquisition time of 7 minutes. It should be noted that the real brain orientation inside the scanner does not affect the oblique slice, because the gradient table is dynamically rotated on the oblique slice angles in such a manner that the X gradient is always X (right-left) of the image.",

The six elements of the diffusion tensor were calculated for each pixel using multivariant linear fitting. After diagonalization, three eigenvalues and eigenvectors were obtained. For the anisotropy map, fractional anisotropy (FA) 19 was used 37. The eigenvector (v1) associated with the largest eigenvalue was used as an indicator for fiber orientation. A 24-bit color-coded orientation map was created by assigning red, green, and blue channels to the x (right-left), y (anterior-posterior), and z (superior-inferior) components of the v1 and its intensity was modulated by FA.",

The method of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) 38 was used to address correlation between measures on the same individual across time-points. The correlation was modeled using an exchangeable correlation matrix. Using GEE, the calculated value, δ, represents fitted mean changes over time as a function of the β statistic, but not β itself. These were calculated as a linear combination of the fitted mean change over time for NC and, where applicable, the estimated difference in mean change over time for either MCI or AD. Longitudinal GEE data techniques were used to handle correlation for multiple observations within individuals. In these analyses, an exchangeable working correlation structure was used to handle correlated measurements within subjects. Robust variance estimates were included because they assure that the inferences are valid even when the assumptions on the working correlation structure are misspecified. All the techniques used in the GEE analysis were in a semiparametric model and did not require normality assumptions in measurements. For group comparisons (NC, MCI, and AD) of the DTI, clinical, and cognitive measures, Wald tests of regression coefficients were used. Covariates for analyses incorporating the DTI measures included baseline age and the number of voxels in the ROI. FA and MD measurements are reported as averages between left and right hemispheres, after being analyzed separately and finding little difference between the two. All computations were done using STATA, version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this DTI study of NC, MCI, and AD participants, we examined WM differences (FA and MD) four times over 12 months within and between diagnostic groups in eight a prioridefined ROIs. There were stable, region-specific, cross-sectional differences at all timepoints between the NC and AD groups for FA and MD in both slices of the fornix and the splenium. However, increasing MD in the fornix was evident in the MCI group only. Further, fornix MD increased faster over the 12-month period in MCI cases compared with NC. In contrast, there were no notable within-or between-group FA changes over time.\nDTI is a noninvasive technique used to measure white-matter integrity by imaging the anisotropic motion of water molecules. FA and MD report scalar values that approximate fiber integrity, generally in areas of highly concentrated axons. Reductions in FA and increases in MD reflect less constrained motion of water molecules about the longitudinal axis of axons. Decreasing FA is thought to represent changes in tissue cytoarchitecture due to a variety of causes, including vascular alteration, demyelination, and possibly gliosis 39,40. Increasing MD most likely results in an increase in extracellular space and elevated water diffusivity in all directions and probably represents loss of neurons, axons, and dendrites in neurodegenerative diseases 41,42. In patients with AD, it is believed that WM degradation is a result of Wallerian degeneration and rarefaction 12,40. These may be a part of a cortical disconnection that affects, in a progressive fashion, the cortical neuronal soma as well as axons and dendrites in the cerebral WM 21,434445. Postulated causes of the resultant inhomogeneity of WM microstructure include: myelin pallor; progressive demyelination; axonal or dendritic degeneration; complete invasion and deposition of Aβ peptide; and replacement of the neuronal soma by neurofibrillary tangles 464748. The precise pathogenetic mechanisms for these WM changes remain unclear.\nWe observed significantly increasing MD (inferior cingulum, anterior cingulum, and fornix) within the MCI group over the 12-month study period, even though clinical changes were not evident. These findings are in partial agreement with the only other longitudinal DTI study published to date (Teipel et al 30), which demonstrated significant change in a clinically stable MCI group. Unlike their study, we showed significant changes in MD, not FA. Further, we found that both the fornix and cingulum changed significantly, whereas Teipel et al reported change in the corpus callosum. Despite these discrepancies, both studies showed a striking signal within the MCI group, even when there was little cognitive change. Although the precise neural correlates of altered diffusivity are not completely understood, our findings suggest that MD is a more specific indicator of longitudinal change in MCI that likely precedes clinical change. This is consistent with the view (see earlier) that MD is more sensitive to neurodegeneration.\nOur stable cross-sectional findings of lower FA and higher MD, primarily in the fornix and splenium, are consistent with many other studies in AD demonstrating impaired WM integrity in similarly investigated ROIs 14,16,18,21,23,25,28,30,495051. Although we also saw significant group differences in other areas (e.g., the mean MD in inferior cingulum CG1 between NC and MCI at the 6-month time-point), the latter were not consistent and are most likely due to chance. In contrast, differences in the fornix and splenium were consistent across all time-points when comparing the NC and AD groups, suggesting these findings are stable. Notably, there were few cross-sectional differences between the MCI and NC groups or the MCI and AD groups, suggesting that these measures cannot be used for clinical diagnosis to distinguish between these groups.\nThe absence of predictable and consistent within-group longitudinal change in AD patients over the 12 months is unexpected, especially considering the significant clinical decline in the AD group. We initially hypothesized that we would find decreasing FA or increasing MD among AD patients. Our results indicate that WM changes detectable by current DTI methods, even when considering the potential for measurement error, occurred early in the Alzheimers disease process, during the MCI phase. WM changes in the AD group may have reached a maximal level and plateaued, even when clinical change continued to progress. Current understanding of the spread of AD pathology as starting in the medial temporal lobe and spreading to other heteromodal association cortices 52 supports our observations that the spread took place in the areas of WM that we studied and likely other areas as well. Our assertion that the greatest change occurs in the prodromal stage of AD is consistent with the current understanding that pathologic alterations precede clinical presentation.\nNotably, there were small increases and decreases of FA and MD in all groups between baseline and 6 months. However, these changes seem too small to effectively represent meaningful anatomic change, especially when considering measurement variance at crosssectional time-points. As such, we suggest that increases in FA or decreases in MD in any diagnostic group over a short time frame (i.e., 0-6 months) should not be interpreted as a marker of anatomic change, especially if there are no clinical changes. In contrast, changes over 6 months, especially in MCI, may be of value as biomarkers of the effects of AD on the WM. We caution against making overly generalized assumptions about using DTI as a longitudinal measure before these results are replicated.\nFinally, we consider the fornix as an area of increasing importance in the pathobiology of AD. These findings (see Table 4 and Fig. 2) further suggest that the fornix is affected mostly during the MCI stage, or earlier, and that as we hypothesized before, early degeneration of the fornix in MCI might be an early indicator of progression. It also follows that the fornix would be implicated in the progressive decline of AD because it serves as cholinergic input into the hippocampus as well as performing outflow projections to other areas in the brain 53. The disconnection syndrome referred to previously fits well with the secondary degeneration model of AD where the loss of WM integrity continues to represent downstream effects of neuronal pathology 46,52,54. The specific cause of the pathology, whether by primary damage to myelin or by axonal damage, continues to be debated.\nOur study is not without limitations. We acknowledge that ROI methods may not be optimal in studying longitudinal changes in MCI and AD. ROI methods of DTI analysis are subject to a priori assumptions of regions of pathologic damage and are operator-dependent. Atlasbased methods are promising approaches for examining larger numbers of regions without the constraints of abiding by theoretical hypotheses 55,56. We note, however, that atlasbased analyses of this data set are consistent with our ROI findings with regard to the importance of the fornix. Future studies may include voxel-by-voxel or atlas-based analyses to take into account additional anatomic regions 57. Other studies may also compare and contrast longitudinal measurements of different imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), MRI morphometry, etc., to DTI. More work is needed to replicate our findings, test other regions, as well as to track changes at intervals of longer than 12 months.\nOur study also has several strengths. First, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to serially examine DTI cross-sectionally, and longitudinally over 1 year in both MCI and AD. This is important because MCI is thought to be the prodromal stage of AD and understanding the anatomic changes of WM as sequential stages corresponding to clinical diagnosis is important for understanding the inferred pathophysiology of the disease. Second, although 25 subjects per study group is a low number, our sample size represents one of the larger DTI cohorts in the MCI and AD literature. Third, we examined both FA and MD. This is significant because our results suggest that MD may be more sensitive to change over a 12-month period.

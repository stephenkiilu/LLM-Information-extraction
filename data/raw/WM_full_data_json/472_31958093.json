    "abstract": "Identification of biological changes underlying the early symptoms of Alzheimers disease (AD) will help to identify and stage individuals prior to symptom onset. The limbic system, which supports episodic memory and is impaired early in AD, is a primary target. In this study, brain metabolism and microstructure evaluated by high field (7 Tesla) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were evaluated in the limbic system of eight individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nine with AD, and sixteen normal elderly controls (NEC). Left hippocampal glutamate and posterior cingulate N-acetyl aspartate concentrations were reduced in MCI and AD compared to NEC. Differences in DTI metrics indicated volume and white matter loss along the cingulum in AD compared to NEC. Metabolic and microstructural changes were associated with episodic memory performance assessed using Craft Story 21 Recall and Benson Complex Figure Copy. The current study suggests that metabolite concentrations measured using 1 H-MRS may provide insight into the underlying metabolic and microstructural processes of episodic memory impairment.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that results in progressive impairments across cognitive domains such as memory, language, and executive function 1. Although neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are hallmarks of AD pathology, the biological mechanisms underlying the development of AD are complex and heterogeneous. No clear cause 1 or chain of events have been identified that lead to the clinical presentation of AD 2.\nClinically, AD progression is considered a continuum, beginning with an asymptomatic phase that transitions into a symptomatic predementia phase called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, followed by a symptomatic dementia phase called probable AD. However, identifying where an individual lies along the disease continuum requires subjective clinical judgment, with greater diagnostic uncertainty early in the disease continuum. Incorporating biomarkers of AD pathology, such as measures of amyloid- (A) load, could help reduce this uncertainty 3,4. Additionally, volumetric measures of brain structure derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 5, white matter microstructural integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 6, functional connectivity derived from functional MRI (fMRI) 7, and glucose uptake measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 8 provide complimentary information that can also aid in staging the disease. Despite the availability of these sophisticated measures, it remains difficult to predict when and who will progress from MCI to AD. Even though diseasemodifying treatments for AD are being investigated 9, they are not yet clinically available. Nevertheless, improving the ability to place an individual along the AD continuum, especially during the predementia phases, will help patients receive timely care and symptomatic treatment that could improve their quality of life 10.\nBoth the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) are known to be involved early in the pathological progression of AD 11. Interestingly, both the hippocampus and PCC are connected by white matter fibers that run through the cingulum and are components of the Papez brain circuit, also known as the medial limbic system 1213141516. Damage to the grey matter and white matter structures of the Papez circuit is associated with episodic memory impairment 171819. Episodic memory impairment is among the earliest and most severe cognitive changes in AD 20, and is considered the most clinically relevant for assessing AD patients 21. Structural changes in both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex 5,17,22232425, as well as changes in white matter microstructural integrity within the cingulum 6,22,2627282930 have previously been shown in AD and MCI.\nIn addition to brain structure, measures of brain metabolism may provide insight into disease stage, particularly since there is evidence that metabolic changes may precede changes in cellular microstructure, neuronal density, and death 313233. This suggests that measurement of brain metabolism could aid in the prediction of cognitive decline prior to the detection of structural changes at early stages of the disease. Though FDG-PET is a common measure of in vivo brain metabolism in AD, a less expensive, more accessible, and non-invasive method is proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) 34. Several metabolites relevant to neuronal function can be simultaneously measured by 1 H-MRS in specific brain regions. Previous studies have shown decreased N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio 3536373839, decreased NAA concentration 404142, and decreased glutamate (Glu) 39,43 in the hippocampus and PCC of individuals with AD.\nAlthough previous studies have independently shown altered brain metabolite levels in the PCC and hippocampus as well as altered microstructure in the cingulum in people with MCI and AD, it is unclear whether these changes occur simultaneously in the same individuals. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether altered metabolism in the hippocampus and PCC was associated with altered white matter microstructure in the cingulum of individuals with MCI and AD. Measuring metabolism using 1 H-MRS and white matter microstructure using DTI within regions of the Papez circuit that are associated with episodic memory could provide valuable information to help support a diagnosis of MCI or probable AD. Thus, the main objectives of this study were to: 1) correlate 1 H-MRS measurements in the hippocampus and PCC with MRI-derived measures of microstructural integrity in the cingulum, and 2) correlate 1 H-MRS measurements in the hippocampus and PCC with measurements of episodic memory performance. We hypothesized that glutamate and NAA concentrations as measured by 1 H-MRS would be lower in the PCC and left hippocampus of individ-uals with AD, and significantly correlated with both MRI-derived measures of microstructural integrity in the cingulum and measurements of episodic memory performance.",

Of these, sixteen subjects were cognitively normal elderly controls (NEC), eight subjects had a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and nine subjects had a clinical diagnosis of probable AD. This study was approved by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. Informed consent was acquired according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\nMCI and AD subjects were diagnosed according to the most recent core clinical criteria put forward by the National Institute of Aging and Alzheimers Association (NIA-AA) working Groups 3,4. The MCI criteria were consistent with the previously published Petersen criteria 444546. The AD criteria were consistent with the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and StrokeAlzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDSADRDA) criteria 47. Clinical head CTs and MRIs were also used to investigate non-AD causes of cognitive impairment such as white matter loss or lacunar infarcts. Any subject with a significant number of lacunar infarcts, a single strategically located lacunar infarct, or significant white matter loss (25) were not considered for this study.\nAdditional exclusion criteria for the study were: 1) uncontrolled mood or psychiatric symptoms in the 6 months prior to study enrolment; 2) use of antidepressant with anti-cholinergic side effects; 3) use of psychoactive medication excluding anti-depressants, neuroleptics, chronic anxiolytics, opioid pain relievers, or sedative hypnotics within the four weeks prior to study enrolment; 4) enrolment in a clinical trial using an investigational medication; and 5) contraindications to ultra-high field MRI scanning. All subjects were aged between 55-90 years old and had a Geriatric Depression Score (GDS) less than 6. Subjects taking cholinesterase inhibitors andor memantine were included if they were on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to study enrolment. In general, the inclusion, exclusion, and diagnostic criteria used in this study were consistent with the criteria used by the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI2) study 48.",

First, a transformation between T 1 -space and standard MNI152-space was found by registering the T 1 weighted anatomical image and the MNI152 T 1 weighted template. The registration was performed by first using a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) linear registration, followed by a 12 DOF linear registration, and non-linear registration. Linear and non-linear registrations were performed using FMRIBs linear image registration tool (FLIRT) 58,59 and FMRIBs non-linear imaging registration tool (FNIRT), respectively. These tools are part of FMRIBs Software Library (FSL), version 5.0.10 606162. Using the resulting transformation matrix, the MNI152 brain mask was then transformed in T 1 -space and applied to the anatomical images and T 1 -maps.\nSince EPI sequences are prone to susceptibility distortions, the diffusion weighted images were distortion-corrected using an estimated susceptibility off-resonance field, derived from the two b  0 smm 3 images acquired with opposite phase encode directions. The topup tool from FSL 63 was used to apply this correction. Other distortions induced by eddy currents and subject motion were then corrected using the FSL eddy tool 64. This processing also generated a distortion-corrected b  0 smm 3 image.\nA transformation from T 1 -space to diffusionspace was found by linearly registering the T 1 weighted anatomical image and the distortioncorrected b  0 smm 3 image using the FSL epi reg script. Applying the previously found MNI152-space to T 1 -space transformation matrix and the T 1 -space to diffusion-space transformation matrices in series transformed the MNI152 brain mask into diffusionspace for brain extraction of the diffusion weighted images. Then, using the FSL dtifit command-line program, a diffusion tensor model was fitted to every voxel within the brain-extracted diffusion weighted images, and subject-specific fraction anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AxD) maps were produced. An example of a subjectspecific FA map generated from diffusion tensor fitting of brain-extracted diffusion weighted images is shown in Fig. 3a.",

      "text": "The 1 H-MRS data were first lineshape and eddy current corrected using combined QUALITY deconvolution and eddy current correction (QUECC) 65 with 400 QUALITY (quantification improvement by converting lineshapes to the Lorentzian type) points 66. Residual water in the water suppressed spectrum was removed by subtracting peaks between 4.2 ppm and 5.7 ppm identified by a Hankel singular value decomposition fitting routine that required no prior knowledge.\nSimulated, 7T semi-LASER prior knowledge templates that included an empirically measured macromolecule model were fitted in the time-domain to the water suppressed data using in-house software called fitMAN 67, which uses a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm 68 to minimize the difference between the data and the template. A detailed description of the simulations and macromolecule model were described previously 53. Briefly, the following metabolites were included in the prior knowledge template used to fit the water suppressed data from the PCC: NAA, N-acetylaspartyl glutamate (NAAG), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (Myo), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), glutathione (GSH), phosphorylethanolamine (PEth), scyllo-inositol (Scyllo), taurine (Tau), alanine (Ala), glucose (Glc), GABA, glycine (Gly), and lactate (Lac). The multiplets of NAA were fitted independently, because they experience a different rate of T 2 relaxation than the singlet at 2.01 ppm 69. The prior knowledge template used to fit the water suppressed data from the left hippocampus did not include PEth and Gly, because the lower signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of these data made it difficult to reliably fit these low amplitude signals.\nTo reduce the number of variables to be fitted, many parameters describing the lineshapes of the metabolites were constrained within the prior knowledge template (Table 1). Within metabolites, the peak amplitudes, shifts, and phases were fixed relative to one another. Relative peak amplitudes were not fixed between metabolites, since these are expected to vary across subjects. Relative peak positions and phases between some metabolites were fixed. For example, the positions and phases of low-amplitude metabolites (e.g., Ala, GABA, Lac) were linked to the positions and phases of higher-amplitude metabolites (e.g., NAA, myo-inositol, glutamate). A summary of the parameter constraints is given in Table 1.\nHippocampal and PCC metabolite concentrations (M) were obtained as previously described 70 by using the fitted and corrected amplitudes of the metabolite signals ( Ŝm ), the corrected water signal amplitude ( ŜW ) from each spectroscopy voxel as an internal reference, and the concentration of pure water (55.14 M) (Equation 1):\nwhere f GM and f WM are, respectively, the grey matter (GM) fraction and white matter (WM) fraction in the spectroscopy voxels. Multiplication by 1 f GM f WM in Equation 1 produces tissue concentrations. Without this factor, concentrations within the entire volume of the spectroscopy voxel would be calculated. Since metabolite signals detected by 1 H-MRS originate from the tissue and not the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such voxel concentrations are biased by the CSF partial volume. Instead, tissue concentrations, which are not affected by the amount of CSF in the voxel, were calculated in the present study.\nThe corrected water signal amplitudes from the hippocampus and PCC were obtained by fitting the water unsuppressed data acquired from the respective regions with a prior knowledge template containing a single Lorentzian at 4.7 ppm. The fitted amplitude was first corrected for the number of averages used during data acquisition (N W avg ), for any gain and scaling factors applied to the data (G W ), and for the number of 1 H-MRS visible nuclei in water (ρ W ). Next, a correction for the T 1 and T 2 relaxation rates of water in GM, WM, and CSF was applied. This requires the GM, WM, and CSF fractions in the spectroscopy voxels, as well as the T 1 and T 2 values of water in each tissue compartment. To estimate the GM, WM, and CSF fractions in the spectroscopy voxels, image voxels in the T 1 weighted anatomical images were first classified as GM, WM, or CSF using FMRIBs Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST) 71. Then, within each spectroscopy voxel, the number of GM, WM, and CSF image voxels were divided by the total number of image voxels to obtain the GM fraction (f GM ), the WM fraction (f WM ), and CSF fraction (f CSF ), respectively. The T 1 values used for this correction were 2.1s, 1.2s, and 4.4s for water in GM, WM, and CSF, respectively, and were obtained directly from literature 72. The T 2 value of water in GM, WM, and CSF were esti-Table 1 A summary of relationships between metabolite parameters in the prior knowledge template 67. Peak positions (shifts) and phases of low-amplitude metabolites were linked to the shifts and phases of higher-amplitude metabolites. Within metabolites, peak amplitudes, shifts, and phases were fixed relative to one another. The following metabolites were included in the prior knowledge template used to fit 1 H-MRS data from the PCC: NAA, NAAG, Cho, Cr, Myo, Glu, Gln, GSH, PEth, Scyllo, Tau, Ala, Glc, GABA, Gly, and Lac. The prior knowledge template used to fit Gln, GSH, GABA Gln, GSH mated using T 2 measurements made by Marjańska et al. 69 in the occipital lobe, motor cortex, and cerebellum. Estimated T 2 relaxation time constants of water were 47 ms, 45 ms, and 66 ms for GM, WM, and CSF, respectively. A correction for the relative proton density of water in GM (α W GM ), WM (α W WM ), and CSF (α W CSF ) as compared to that of pure water was also incorporated into this correction. Values used for α W GM , α W WM , and α W CSF were 0.82, 0.73, and 1.00, respectively, and were obtained from 73. The corrections applied to the fitted water signal amplitude (A W ) are summarized in Equation 2 adapted from Gasparovic et al. 70, where R W GM , R W WM , and R W CSF are relaxation correction terms using the tissue specific T 1 and T 2 relaxation rates of water. For\n, where\n1,GM is the T 1 of water in GM (2.1s) and T W 2,GM is the T 2 of water in GM (47 ms). R W WM and R W CSF are similarly defined.\nThe fitted amplitudes of the metabolite signals were also corrected for the number of averages used during data acquisition (N m avg ), for any gain and scaling factors applied to the data (G m ), for the number of 1 H-MRS visible nuclei in the metabolite (ρ m ), and for the T 1 and T 2 relaxation rates of metabolites in GM and WM. T 1 values of metabolites in GM and WM were obtained from literature, while T 2 values of metabolites in GM and WM were estimated using measurements made by Marjańska et al. 69 in the motor cortex and cerebellum, Wong et al. 53 in the motor cortex, and Ryan et al. 74 in the motor cortex. Reported tissue fractions and metabolite T 2 values were incorporated into the estimation. The T 1 and T 2 values used for relaxation rate correction are summarized in Table 2. All corrections applied to the fitted metabolite amplitudes are summarized in Equation 3 from Gasparovic et al. 70, where Kis the number of peaks for the metabolite m and A m k is the kth peak of the metabolite.

    "Tractography and diffusion metrics in the cingulum": {
      "text": "To study the relationship between spectroscopy measurements to MRI-derived measures of neuronal injury in the cingulum, the left cingulum of each subject was reconstructed using diffusion-based tractography. Two separate segments, as defined by Wakana et al. 75, were identified: the cingulate gyrus portion that runs along the cingulate gyrus, and the hippocampal portion that runs along the ventral side of the hippocampus. As shown in Fig. 2, the cingulate gyrus portion passed through the spectroscopy voxel placed in the PCC, while the hippocampal portion passed through both spectroscopy voxels.\nThe cingulate gyrus portion was identified using whole-brain tractography followed by an atlas-based technique to select only those tracts that belonged to the cingulum. First, the T 1 weighted anatomical image was transformed into diffusion-space using the previously found transformation matrix. From this image, a WM mask was generated using FSL FAST. Then, Bayesian probabilistic tracking with a diffusion tensor model 76 was performed on the brain-extracted diffusion weighted images (Fig. 3a) using every voxel in the WM mask as a seed voxel. The produced tracts were refined using an exclusion region of interest (ROI) defined based on the left cingulumcingulate gyrus mask (label 5) from the 2 mm probabilistic Johns Hopkins white matter tractography atlas thresholded at zero 77,78. This thresholded atlas was included with FSL. The mask was transformed from MNI152-space into the subject-specific diffusion-space using the previously found transformation matrices (Fig. 3b 1 ). Only tracts that lay completely within this mask were retained. Any tracts that touched the edge of the mask were discarded. Tracts that were shorter than the mean tract length minus one standard deviation were also discarded. An example of the result is shown in Fig. 3c 1 .\nThe hippocampal portion of the cingulum was also identified using Bayesian tractography. How- a T 1 and T 2 values of metabolites which could not be determined were assumed to be similar to that of Myo 69,118. b T 2 values of NAAG were assumed to be similar to that of NAA 69. c T 2 values of Gln were assumed to be similar to that of Glu 69. d T 1 and T 2 values of GABA were assumed to the same in both GM and WM, as 117 did not report separate values for GM and WM. ever, instead of using an atlas, the tractography was constrained by the spectroscopy voxels. Every image voxel within the left hippocampal spectroscopy voxel was used to seed the tractography and every image voxel within the PCC spectroscopy voxel was used as a waypoint. With this approach, only tracts that began in the hippocampal spectroscopy voxel and passed through the PCC spectroscopy voxel were identified.\nTracts were grouped based on geometric similarity using spectral clustering 79,80 and only the cluster of tracts with a geometry that matched the hippocampal portion of the cingulum was retained (Fig. 3b 2 ). Of those tracts, any that were shorter than the mean tract length of the cluster minus one standard deviation were also discarded. An example of the result is shown in Fig. 3c 2 . The identified tracts were then modelled as cubic B-splines and re-parameterized to 33 vertices to facilitate between-group statistical analysis 81. Diffusion metrics were assigned to each vertex of the Fig. 3. Diffusion-based tractography of the left cingulum. For both the cingulate gyrus portion and hippocampal portion of the cingulum, Bayesian probabilistic tracking with a diffusion tensor model 76 was performed on the brain-extracted diffusion weighted images shown in (a). The produced tracts were refined using an atlas-based exclusion region of interest (b 1 ) to identify the cingulate gyrus portion of the cingulum (c 1 ). Using the spectroscopy voxels as seeds and waypoints and discarding those tracts that were not geometrically similar to the hippocampal portion of the cingulum (b 2 ), the hippocampal portion of the cingulum was identified (c 2 ). The identified tracts of the cingulum were modelled as B-splines, and diffusion metrics were assigned to each vertex of the B-spline, as shown in (c 1 ) and (c 2 ), where the colors represent the FA values along the cingulum.

Tissue T 1 values were also assigned to each vertex, by first transforming the T 1 map to diffusion-space using the previously found transformation matrix, and then selecting the T 1 value from the corresponding image voxel. The metrics were averaged across corresponding vertices to obtain mean measures of FA, RD, AxD, and T 1 along the cingulum.

Before analysis, outliers were first identified using Grubbs method 82 with the significance level () set to 0.05. As a result, one AD subject was an outlier and removed from the analysis of the hippocampal spectroscopy data. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each measured metabolite to identify between-group differences at   0.05. If a significant difference among group means was found, a post-hoc between-group comparison using Fishers least significant differences (LSD) test was performed. For three groups at   0.05, Fishers LSD guarantees that the familywise error rate (FWER) does not exceed 0.05 83.\nCognitive testing data were analyzed in a similar way. An ANOVA was performed for each of the scores obtained from the CSR and BCFC tests to identify between-group differences at   0.05. If the group effect was significant, a post-hoc LSD test with   0.05 was performed to identify statistically significant differences between groups.\nTo determine whether along-cingulum metrics changed between groups, a linear mixed effect regression as described in 81 was performed for each metric and for each pairwise comparison. The regression contains a vertex-by-group interaction that tests whether the effect of group on a metric varies based on position along the tract. If an ANOVA of the vertexby-group interaction term was significant at   0.05, linear mixed effect regressions were performed at each vertex to test whether there was an effect of group on a metric. If the effect was significant at a level of   0.05, the metric was considered to be different between groups at that tract position. Statistical analyses of along-cingulum diffusion measures were performed in R 84.\nFor both the hippocampal and cingulate gyrus portions of the cingulum, the diffusion metric values in the largest continuous region of statistical difference between groups were averaged and used to examine association with the spectroscopy measurements that were significantly different between groups.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Using 1 H-MRS at 7T, this study measured concentrations of metabolites within the episodic memory system of people with normal cognition and of people with a clinical diagnosis of MCI and probable AD. Significant decreases in left hippocampal glutamate concentration and in posterior cingulate cortex NAA concentrations were found (Fig. 1) in the MCI and AD groups. Within the cingulum, diffusion-based indicators of white-matter microstructural integrity showed that the AD group had significant higher RD, AxD, and T 1 in the first 25 of the hippocampal cingulum (Fig. 4) and significantly lower FA and higher RD in the last 60-90 of the cingulate gyrus portion of the cingulum (Fig. 5) compared to the NEC and MCI groups. Both hippocampal glutamate concentration and NAA concentration in the PCC were significantly associated with altered water diffusion and T 1 relaxation within the cingulum (Fig. 6), as well as episodic memory performance measured by the CSR and BCFC neuropsychological tests (Fig. 7).",

    "Posterior cingulate cortex": {
      "text": "Compared to NEC subjects, both MCI and AD subjects had significantly lower NAA concentration in the PCC. This result is consistent with previous studies that have also reported lower NAA concentration in the PCC of AD and MCI subjects compared to NECs 414243.\nSince NAA synthesis in the brain requires acetylcoenzyme A (acetyl CoA) levels that exceed neuronal metabolic requirements 85, a decrease in NAA concentration in the PCC likely indicates that energy reserves are low in this region. Indeed, studies using FDG-PET have consistently shown energy deficits in the PCC of people with AD 86878889. This energy deficit would result in lower acetyl CoA levels and compromise NAA synthesis.\nImpaired NAA synthesis could have detrimental downstream effects. NAA is synthesized in neurons, but the enzyme that catabolizes NAA into its component aspartate and acetate moieties is localized exclusively to oligodendrocytes 909192. The sequential action of this enzyme, aspartoacylase II (ASPA-II), along with acetyl CoA synthetase-1 (AceCS-1), will convert NAA-derived acetate into acetyl CoA, which could be used by oligodendrocytes for the synthesis of myelin-associated lipids 93. Thus, impaired NAA synthesis could negatively affect myelin repair and remyelination processes.\nMRI-derived measures of white matter microstructural integrity in the current study are consistent with this interpretation. Specifically, the last 60-90 of the cingulate gyrus portion of the cingulum, which corresponds anatomically to the posterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 2, Fig. 3c 1 ), showed significant differences in MRI-derived measures of microstructural integrity between AD subjects and NEC subjects. AD subjects had lower FA, higher RD, but no difference in AxD. This pattern of changes in diffusion metrics is characteristic of an underlying demyelination process 94. Further, NAA concentration in the PCC was significantly associated with this pattern of change-that is, lower NAA concentration was associated with lower FA and higher RD. These results, together with the finding that a lower NAA concentration in the PCC was significantly associated with worse CSR and BCFC scores, suggests that NAA deficit in the PCC of people with AD could indicate a demyelinating process in the region that manifests as poorer episodic memory performance.\nImportantly, lower NAA concentrations were observed in both MCI and AD subjects compared to NEC subjects, whereas differences in diffusion metrics were only observed in AD subjects compared to NECs. This suggests that a decrease in the posterior cingulate NAA concentration may precede microstructural changes indicative of demyelination in the region, although a longitudinal study would be required to confirm this hypothesis.",

    "Hippocampus": {
      "text": "In the left hippocampus, lower glutamate levels in MCI and AD subjects were observed in the current study. Consistent with this result, a previous study by our group 39 at 4T in a different cohort also found significantly lower hippocampal glutamate concentration in AD subjects compared to NEC subjects, but no significant differences between MCI and NEC subjects. The lower glutamate levels observed in MCI subjects in the current study is likely due to the increased sensitivity of 7T MR spectroscopy or could be attributed to differences in the cohort studied. An important methodological difference to consider is that Rupsingh et al. positioned the spectroscopy voxel in the right hippocampus, while the left hippocampus was examined in the present study. Measurements in the left hippocampus may be sensitive to earlier changes exhibited at the MCI stage, as it is wellknown that left hippocampal atrophy precedes right hippocampal atrophy in AD 23,95.\nThe MRI-derived measures of microstructural integrity showed that compared to NEC subjects, AD subjects had significantly greater RD, AxD, and T 1 in the first 25 of the left hippocampal cingulum, which corresponds anatomically to the left hippocampus (Fig. 2, Fig. 3c 2 ). The pattern of RD and AxD changes is characteristic of increased CSF 96, which could result from overall tissue atrophy. The observed T 1 differences also support this interpretation, as the T 1 of CSF water is greater than the T 1 of tissue bound water 72. Thus, the reduced left hippocampal glutamate concentrations observed in AD subjects may be a result of a loss of neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is highly dependent on glutamate signaling 97,98.\nInterestingly, these microstructural changes were not observed in the MCI subjects, which suggests that the reduced glutamate concentration observed in the MCI subjects was not the result of the loss of glutamatergic neurons. Rather, it may be related to an energy deficit in the hippocampus. Reduced glucose metabolism will reduce citrate production in neurons, in turn reducing ATP production via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Indeed, reduced glucose metabolism in the hippocampus of individuals with MCI have been previously reported 31,99. To meet the energy demands of the neuron, glutamate and oxaloacetate can be used by aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) as alternative substrates for -ketoglutarate production in a truncated TCA cycle 100. Interestingly, excess acetate is produced in this process, which may be acetylated into NAA by Laspartate N-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT). Increased NAA production would facilitate the AAT reaction, by removing the product inhibition from acetate. In fact, there is evidence of an upregulated rate of NAA synthesis in AD 101. Increased NAA production and increased glutamate consumption due to neuronal energy deficit could also explain why a significant reduction in left hippocampal glutamate concentration, but no difference in left hippocampal NAA concentration, was observed in the present study.\nThis result from the current study is consistent with results previously published by our group in the right hippocampus, in which no differences in right hippocampal NAA concentration were found 39. However, others have reported NAA concentration differences in mean bilateral hippocampal NAA concentrations between AD and NEC subjects 40, as well as significant differences in left hippocampal NAA concentrations between NEC, MCI, and AD subjects 41. Methodological differences with respect to the corrections for the relaxation rates of metabolite signal in each of the grey matter, white matter, and CSF compartments of the spectroscopy voxel could explain why lower NAA was not observed in either the current study or in Rupsingh et al.\nLeft hippocampal glutamate concentration was also observed to be significantly associated with better CSR and BCFC scores. This, together with the previously discussed results, suggests that lower glutamate concentration in the left hippocampus could indicate impaired neuro-energetics or a loss of glutamatergic neurons, ultimately manifesting as poorer episodic memory performance.",

    "Study limitations": {
      "text": "There are several limitations to the present study that should be considered. First, the generalizability of the results is limited by the small sample size. Nevertheless, significant differences in metabolite concentrations and diffusion metrics were observed, which may be due to the improved precision of both spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging at the high magnetic field (7T) used. In particular, the size of the group effect as measured using η 2 and Hays ω 2 102,103 was large for both the hippocampal glutamate concentration (η 2  0.231, ω 2  0.162) and the posterior cingulate NAA concentration (η 2  0.315, ω 2  0.264), implying that the study was sufficiently powered. The results of the present study are also consistent with prior studies, providing further confidence in the results. Specifically, other studies have independently shown decreased glutamate in the hippocampus 39,104, decreased NAA in the posterior cingulate cortex 42,43,104,105, and microstructural changes in the limbic system 22,30,106,107 in individuals with AD. Also, power was maximized for all correlational analyses as these were done using all study subjects with successfully acquired spectroscopy data (N  27 for hippocampal data and N  33 for PCC data), without consideration for group membership. Despite replicating previous work in different cohorts, the results should be considered preliminary in light of the small sample size and should be replicated in future studies. Utilizing the calculated effect sizes for NAA and glutamate, we estimate that a future study to replicate these results should include a minimum of 9 subjects per group for NAA, and 12 subjects per group for glutamate (3 groups, power  0.8, p  0.05, two-tailed one-way ANOVA, GPower 108).\nSecond, participants of this study with AD likely reflected a subset of the clinical population. In addition to changes in episodic memory, many individuals diagnosed with AD also present with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, agitation, and depression which typically worsen as the disease progresses 109,110. However, the exclusion criteria used in the present study excluded potential participants with neuropsychiatric symptoms. All participants in the current study had GDS scores that were less than 6, indicating that none had depressive symptoms. Thus, MCI and AD participants of this study likely reflect a clinical population with mild disease that lies earlier along the AD continuum. Furthermore, the inclusion of only subjects without neuropsychiatric symptoms eliminates this variable as a cause of the metabolic and microstructural changes observed in the current study.\nThird, the present study used single-voxel 1 H-MRS to study metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex. The metabolite concentration measured using singlevoxel 1 H-MRS is the average tissue concentration within the entire spectroscopy voxel. As a result, it is not possible to discern whether the observed differences in hippocampal glutamate concentrations arise from the metabolic pool or the neurotransmitter pool. In the PCC, it is also not possible to say whether the observed differences in the NAA concentration are localized to the neuronal compartment, the oligodendrocyte compartment, or both compartments. Another point of caution is that the method of metabolite quantification used in the present study incorporated T 1 and T 2 relaxation correction using values obtained from literature and assumed that metabolite T 1 and T 2 values in grey matter and white matter do not change with disease. This was done as it was not possible to measure subject-specific metabolite T 1 and T 2 values due to scan-time constraints. It also important to note here that a field strength of 7 Tesla was used in the present study. 1 H-MRS at ultra-high magnetic fields (4 Tesla and above) benefits from increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and greater spectral dispersion. This is especially important for glutamate detection, as there is better separation of glutamate from the overlapping resonances of glutamine and -aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, at clinical field strengths (3 Tesla and below), focused detection of glutamate changes may benefit from spectral editing techniques such as MEGA-sLASER or MEGA-PRESS 111112113.\nFourth, an atlas-based method of tractography was used, rather than the gold standard of guiding the tractography using manually drawn inclusion and exclusion ROIs. Although an atlas-based method does not suffer from problems such as operator experience, intra-and inter-operator reproducibility, and ROI placement feasibility 114, it is affected by the quality of the registration between the subject scan and the atlas. However, even with just a simple linear registration to the atlas, Zhang et al. has shown good agreement between manuallyguided tractography and an atlas-based technique employing the same atlas as that used in the present study 115. Despite the potential loss of precision with an atlas-based approach to tractography, we were still able to show statistically significant differences in diffusion metrics along the cingulum between groups.",

    "CONCLUSION": {
      "text": "This cross-sectional pilot study compared metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus and in the PCC between small groups of people with MCI, people with AD, and NECs. NAA concentration in the PCC and glutamate concentration in the left hippocampus were significantly lower in both MCI and AD subjects and were significantly associated with both MRI-derived measures of microstructural changes in the cingulum and with episodic memory performance. The observed metabolite differences and associated microstructural differences are consistent with brain energy deficits caused by AD pathology. Thus, metabolite concentrations measured using 1 H-MRS may provide valuable insight into the underlying metabolic and microstructural processes of episodic memory impairment.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to a multisystem and heterogeneous neuropathological spectrum, encompassing conditions mainly affecting the anatomofunctional integrity of frontal and temporal regions (Seelaar, Rohrer, Pijnenburg, Fox,  Van Swieten, 2011;Seltman  Matthews, 2012), with an overall estimated prevalence of 10.84100,000 (Coyle-Gilchrist et al., 2016). FTLD gives rise to different neurobehavioral syndromic expressions (e.g., Woollacott  Rohrer, 2016), involving behavior and social cognition, executive functions or language, for the most part included under the umbrella of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) e i.e., the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) (Rascovsky et al., 2011), and the non-fluent (nfv-PPA) and semantic (sv-PPA) variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). In addition, the corticobasal syndrome (CBS) a complex neurodegenerative syndromes characterised by the clinical combination of motor disorders and cognitive symptoms (Armstrong et al., 2013), has also been encompassed within the FTLD spectrum (Coyle-Gilchrist et al., 2016). Noteworthy, clinical phenotypes depending on FTLD may share common genetic and pathological substrates with adult-onset motor neuron diseases (MNDs) (Davidson et al., 2016;Davidson et al., 2014;Ferrari, Kapogiannis, Huey,  Momeni, 2011;Ling, Polymenidou,  Cleveland, 2013), whose major subtype is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Consistently revealed in both FTLD and MND conditions, the TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) inclusions within the central nervous system, and mutations in the hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene are now considered the main neuropathological and genetic hallmarks joining these two disorders (Lattante, Ciura, Rouleau,  Kabashi, 2015;Ling et al., 2013;Weishaupt, Hyman,  Dikic, 2016) into a unique disease spectrum, ranging from conditions in which cognitive andor behavioural deficits are predominant to disorders primary affecting the motor pathway (Clark  Forman, 2006). Despite specific differences characterizing the clinical syndromes emerging from the FTLD-MND continuum, a frank overlap of signs and symptoms has been observed in a considerable proportion of cases (Devenney, Vucic, Hodges,  Kiernan, 2015). In particular, about 15 of patients clinically diagnosed as FTD develop motor neuron dysfunctions (MNDys) typical of MND and reaching the criteria for the diagnosis of ALS (Burrell, Kiernan, Vucic,  Hodges, 2011;Lomen-Hoerth, 2011). Of note, about one-third of FTLD patients with subclinical (i.e., neurophysiological) or mild clinical signs of MNDys does not fulfil the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of MNDALS (Burrell et al., 2011;Cerami et al., 2015).\nClinical and neurophysiological signs of MNDys in FTLD have been attributed to the pathological involvement of the primary motor cortex, whose involvement has been assumed to drive the secondary degeneration of lower motor neurons (Burrell et al., 2011). Neuropathological studies reported in bvFTD a time-sequential propagation of neurostructural impairments due to the dissemination of phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates, starting from prefrontal cortex and then spreading caudally to involve sensorimotor cortices (Brettschneider et al., 2014). Neuroimaging findings provided support to this hypothesis, by showing the presence of neurostructural damages involving the premotor and motor cortices, as well as the corticospinal pathway, in bvFTD (Crespi et al., 2018;Lillo et al., 2012).\nA number of investigations described the typical pattern of neurostructural alterations in different FTLD phenotypes (e.g., Agosta et al., 2015aAgosta et al., , 2012;;Omer et al., 2017) and reported evidence of subclinical motor pathway damage (e.g., Crespi et al., 2018;McMillan et al., 2016;Omer et al., 2017). However, to our knowledge no studies comprehensively investigated the degree and patterns of motor pathway changes within the FTLD spectrum and its relationship with the presence of clinical andor subclinical MNDys.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique appears particularly suitable to identify subtle neuronal changes due to pathological alterations in major white-matter bundles, including the corticospinal tract (CST), even when clinical signs are too subtle to be detected (e.g., Senda et al., 2011). Thus, DTI can be useful in identifying in vivo markers of changes in microstructural integrity in specific clinical populations, included FTLD (see Kassubek et al., 2018a).\nOn this ground, the aim of the present study is two-fold. First, we provided a detailed characterization of common and distinctive microstructural white-matter alterations occurring in the three main subtypes of FTLD e i.e., bvFTD, PPA and CBS e compared to healthy controls, trying to underlie common and possible distinctive alterations, focusing the attention to the CST pathway. Most importantly, we assessed the association of measures of microstructural integrity derived from DTI e i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities e with clinical signs of MNDys. In a sub-group of patients, we additionally evaluated association between DTI metrics and neurophysiological (i.e., needle electromyography) signs of MNDys. Concerning this latter aspect, we hypothesized the presence of microstructural white-matter alteration in one or more DTI metrics along the CST even in patients with no clinical signs and, to a lesser extent, no neurophysiological evidence of MNDys.",

      "text": "In the manuscript we reported how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all inclusion and exclusion criteria, whether inclusionexclusion criteria were established prior to data analysis, all manipulations, and all measures in the study. We included 63 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable sporadic FTLD admitted between 2011 and 2018 at the Clinical Neuroscience Department of San Raffaele Hospital, in Milan, Italy. Sample size was determined on the basis of patient availability. All patients underwent a clinicalneuropsychological evaluation, a neurological examination and a multimodal MRI scanning, including a DTI sequence. A subgroup of them was also addressed to a neurophysiological study (i.e., needle electromyography, EMG) of motor neuron function. Medical records and clinical information were retrospectively collected and evaluated by experienced behavioral neurologists (CC, AM) in order to classify patients into one of the three main FTLD subgroups: bvFTD (Rascovsky et al., 2011), PPA (i.e., both non fluent and semantic variants) (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011) or CBS (Armstrong et al., 2013).\nAt the time of the diagnosis, patients and their caregivers completed a structural clinical interview and a standard neuropsychological battery, assessing global cognitive functioning, memory, social cognition, language, visuo-spatial abilities and attentionexecutive functions. Caregivers also completed a set of inventories to evaluate patients behavioral changes (i.e., Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Frontal Behavioral Inventory).\nWe specifically collected information about the presence of upper (UMN) and lower (LMN) MNDys identified during the clinical motor assessment for all patients, as well as the presence of acute andor chronic neurogenic changes recorded in those patients who underwent neurophysiological study. The UMN and LMN clinical examination included the detailed evaluation of brainstem, cervical, thoracic and lumbar districts, according to procedures previously described (Cerami et al., 2015). A quantitative scale (Ellis et al., 1999) was applied to obtain a more accurate estimation of UMN damage. It reports the total number of pathologically brisk reflex on the biceps, supinator, triceps, finger, knee, and ankle, plus extensor plantar responses and brisk facial and jaw jerks (maximum score ¼ 16). The EMG study included only cervical and lumbosacral regions. Muscles of craniobulbar region were evaluated only if brainstem involvement was suspected on clinical grounds. ALS was diagnosed in presence of combined LMN and UMN signs in at least two regions, in agreement with El Escorial and Awaji criteria (de Carvalho et al., 2008).\nExclusion criteria for the present study were the presence of genetic FTLD, a previous diagnosis or a known family history of MND, a positive medical history for other disorders possibly causative of cognitive decline, head trauma, alcohol or psychotropic drug abuse, the presence of other pathological findings on MRI scans.\nIn addition, since the primary goal of the study was to identify common and distinctive patterns of white-matter microstructural alteration associated to the three main FTLD subtypes, we excluded patients with mixed or unclear clinical profiles, as well as subjects fulfilling current criteria of logopenic variant of PPA (lv-PPA) (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011), given the large proportion of lv-PPA cases presenting a non-FTLD pathological substrate, attributable to Alzheimers Disease (Montembeault, Brambati, Gorno-Tempini,  Migliaccio, 2018).\nThirty-six healthy controls (HC) were recruited from local senior community centers on a voluntary basis for statistical comparisons on MRI data. None of them was taking any medication potentially interfering with neurobehavioral functioning. A next of kin (e.g., spouse) of each control subject was interviewed to corroborate hisher normal daily functioning. Exclusion criteria for HC were the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders and a known family history of MND, a positive neurologic examination, evidence of brain lesions of MRI scans, a global Clinical Dementia Rating score0, a Mini-Mental State Examination score 2830, verbal and visuo-spatial delayed memory performance (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test and Rey Figure Recall task) 25th percentile. All participants, or relative informants, gave their written informed consent to the experimental procedure, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the San Raffaele Hospital.",

Single-subject datasets were first corrected for eddy current distortions and motion artifacts, skull-stripped and finally, as a result of the fitting of the diffusion tensor model at each voxel, maps of diffusion scalar indices were generated. We then carried out DTI group analyses with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006) involving a voxelwise non-linear registration of all subjects Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps that, once aligned, are affinetransformed on a standard space (1 Â 1 Â 1 mm 3 MNI152).\nAfter co-registration, FA maps are averaged to create a mean FA image, and then used to generate a mean FA tract skeleton, representing all common tracts across subjects. In order to exclude from further analysis those parts of the skeleton that could not ensure a good correspondence across subjects, we applied a threshold of .20 to the mean FA skeleton image. Finally, to account for residual misalignments after the initial nonlinear registration, all subjects FA data were projected onto the thresholded mean FA skeleton, creating a 4D dataset of all subjects FA skeletonized data. In addition, we ran the non-FA TBSS script on maps of mean (MD), radial (RD) and axial diffusivities (AD). Then, the resulting skeletonized data were fed into whole-brain voxelwise statistical analysis.",

We used the cluster command included into FSL to extract size (i.e., number of voxels) and number of altered clusters in each FTLD subgroup (i.e., bvFTD, PPA, CBS).

The value of DTI metrics as neuroimaging biomarkers of microstructural degeneration in the FTLD-MND spectrum has been suggested by recent studies tracking the progression of microstructural alteration in bvFTD patients as a reflect of the dissemination of neuropathological processes (Kassubek, Mu ller, Del Tredici, et al., 2018;Kassubek, Mu ller, Tredici, et al., 2018).",

      "text": "Findings from the analysis of distinctive microstructural alterations in patient subgroups versus healthy controls were coherent to previously published studies (e.g., Borroni et al., 2008;Crespi et al., 2018;Lillo et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2013;Schwindt et al., 2013;Tovar-Moll et al., 2014). Globally, all patient subgroups showed microstructural alterations involving long-range intrahemispheric tracts. While bvFTD patients showed a prominent alteration affecting (bilateral) frontal portions of white-matter fibers, in both PPA and CBS we observed a major involvement of more posterior portions of associative bundles, with PPA group showing a greater change in the left hemisphere. All subgroups also showed a severe involvement in the commissural fibers, although showing differences in the regional distribution of major microstructural alterations, namely anterior portions (genu) in bvFTD, central portions in CBS (body) and posterior portions (splenium) in PPA subgroup. Notably, we consistently observed e across all DTI metrics and patient subgroups e different clusters of microstructural alterations along the CST.\nThe analysis of common microstructural alterations across FTLD subgroups (i.e., conjunction analysis) revealed a colocalization of microstructural alterations in long-range intrahemispheric (inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculi, cingulum bundle) and frontal interhemispheric tracts (genu of corpus callosum and forceps minor), mediating the neurostructural connectivity that supports information integration and processing associated to the typical behavioral and cognitive impairments (Laforce, 2013) observed in the different FTLD subtypes (Lansdall et al., 2018). In addition, the conjunction analysis further highlighted a consistent involvement of the superior portion of the CST and the body of corpus callosum across FTLD subgroups, and both these white-matter systems has been denoted as key features of microstructural alterations in ALS (Filippini et al., 2010). Moreover, when focusing on the severity of microstructural alterations of both global and shared microstructural CST alteration, we noted that all DTI metrics resulted, on average, significantly and equally impaired in all FTLD subgroups. To this regard, previous neuroimaging studies showed the presence of microstructural alterations in the CST andor corpus callosum in different FTLD subtypes, i.e., bvFTD (Daianu et al., 2015;Lillo et al., 2012;Mahoney et al., 2014;Whitwell et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2009), PPA (Agosta et al., 2015b;Omer et al., 2017) and CBD (Boelmans et al., 2009;Whitwell et al., 2014) patients. Moreover, in a recent bvFTD-ALS study, we reported an overlap of microstructural damages in the very same structures, with a more severe damage in bvFTD patients with neurophysiological evidence of MNDys (Crespi et al., 2018). Taken together, all these findings corroborate the notion of a pathological spreading of the degenerative process to premotor and motor cortices. Indeed, the neurodegenerative process affecting the CST microstructure in FTLD patients, regardless to the subtype, may be driven by the spread of pathological processes, which primarily involve frontotemporal cortices, and then projections fibers e including the CST e innervating motor cortical regions. We made this assumption on the ground of previous evidence describing an analogous neuropathological dissemination pattern in FTLD cases with autopsy-confirmed TDP-43 proteinopathy and in vivo bvFTD phenotype (Brettschneider et al., 2014). Brettschneider and coworkers (Brettschneider et al., 2014) reported indeed increasing burden of pathology indicative of sequential dissemination of the phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) inclusions. Starting from the orbitofrontal cortex, the pTDP-43 inclusions disseminate caudally until reaching motor and premotor cortices, somatosensory cortex and angular gyrus, bulbar somatomotor neurons and a-motoneurons of the anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord. The progression of pTDP-43 inclusions has also been assessed in vivo, using DTI techniques. Besides confirming the staging of the neuropathological process, the authors proved that FA could be considered a reliable biomarker of the microstructural alterations due to the pTDP-43 dissemination in bvFTD (Kassubek et al., 2018a) and ALS (Kassubek et al., 2018b).\nHere, we reported decreased FA in both distinctive and common patterns of microstructural alteration across our FTLD sample, as well as an abnormal increase in diffusivity measures e i.e., MD, AD and RD e which are thought to reflect different aspects of the underlying microstructural processes. In particular, MD is considered a sensitive but general marker of microstructural degeneration, and its increase denotes a density reduction of cell membrane (Beaulieu, 2002;Douaud et al., 2013). An increase in AD and RD metrics offers more specific information about the underlying neuropathological processes related, respectively, to axonal damageloss and myelin sheets alteration (Bennett, Madden, Vaidya, Howard,  Howard, 2010). Our results seem thus to indicate, as described in previous neuropathological studies (Cairns et al., 2007;Rabinovici  Miller, 2010), that white-matter degeneration in FTLD affects multiple facets of microstructural processes, including demyelination, axonal loss, gliosis, all contributing to the overall decrease in diffusion coherence suggested by the FA reduction.\nNoteworthy, about half of FTLD patients showed a microstructural alteration of the whole CST. This proportion further increases (62e88) when considering the CST regions commonly altered in the three FTLD subgroups. Notably, the microstructural alterations within the corticospinal pathway in FTLD patients was not systematically related to the presence of MNDys, suggesting a subclinical CST alteration in the majority of FTLD patients. Indeed, we found no significant relationship between microstructural alterations along the CST (i.e., in both the CST mask and the CST conjunction mask) and clinical or neurophysiological signs of MNDys. The only exception was the CBS subgroups, in which we found an association between CST microstructural alterations and the presence of MNDys at the clinical evaluation (i.e., UMN signs). This finding in CBS is in our opinion to relate to a primary motor system impairment that, alongside cognitive deficits, characterizes such subtype of atypical parkinsonism (Armstrong et al., 2013).\nWhile the simultaneous presence of CST alteration and clinicalneurophysiological signs of MNDys was detected in the 20e30 of cases (depending on the CST mask used), we observed a high prevalence of white-matter alteration in the CST also in FTLD patients who did not display MNDys at the clinical examination. Analogous findings emerged, even in a smaller subsample, evaluating the association between DTI measures and neurophysiological signs of MNDys. Although EMG is supposed to have a higher sensitivity to detect subtle pathological changes, a routine neurophysiological examination is probably not able to detect subtle changes of motor function occurring in FTLD. Since the proportion of patients with the microstructural alteration of one or more DTI metrics within the CST is larger than that revealed by the clinical andor neurophysiological evaluation of MNDys, is plausible that the white-matter CST alteration is too restricted to clinically interfere with motor function or to affect LMN function being undetected by means of a routine neurophysiological examination. Another possibility is that we underestimated the involvement of the UMN, due to the intrinsic limitations of hereby used neurophysiological methodology. Indeed, while needle EMG represents an appropriate tool in revealing subtle LMN damages, the detection and the quantification of the UMN subclinical involvement is still challenging. Higher accuracy can be reached by using transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters as complementary diagnostic biomarkers in identifying UMN dysfunctions, as recently suggested (Geraldo et al., 2018). Future studies are thus necessary to overcome possible methodological caveats by employing combined MRI and neurophysiological techniques.\nBeside such limitations due to the neurophysiological assessment of UMN involvement, two other issues related to the possible underestimation of MNDys in our FTLD patients should be noted. First, the retrospective nature of the present study may have biased the actual calculation of MNDys prevalence in our FTLD sample. Moreover, the availability of neurophysiological data for a subset of patients can threaten results of this part of the study. Finally, although we discussed our findings in relation to pTDP-43 inclusions dissemination, which represents the main component in ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions that are found in about 50 of FTLD cases (Mackenzie  Neumann, 2016), as well as in the majority of sporadic ALS (Neumann et al., 2006), neuropathological confirmation was not available for our patients, and the sample included sporadic cases only. Noteworthy, since previous studies reported a modulation effect of some single nucleotide polymorphisms on brain structural connectivity (Piavani, Filippini, Van Den Heuvel, Cappa,  Frisoni, 2014), we cannot exclude uninvestigated genetic determinants on the CST alteration we observed in this study. Thus, our findings cannot be considered conclusive, as possible pathological and genetic variability may have affected the present results.\nIn conclusion, some remarks have to be made. First, as literature provides evidence of unspecific but analogous mechanisms of neurodegeneration involving the CS tract in other neurodegenerative conditions, as mild cognitive impairment (e.g., Shao et al., 2019), the CST alteration per se is not specific of FTLD syndromes. However, literature suggests a pathology-driven pattern of WM alterations in the whole brain e including the alteration of CST microstructure e that provides specificity to FTLD (Agosta et al., 2015). The timeline and the topographical trajectories of connectivity changes in the different brain bundles in FTLD syndromes remain mostly unclear. In particular, literature does not provide evidence about whether a precise time-point at which the WM alterations of CST reach such a burden to provoke a motor decline in patients exists. Similarly, no clear information about how pathology progression may influence the CST involvement and cause clinical manifest MNDys signs in individuals. Crosssectional data in symptomatic individuals, as presented here, may add crucial information to unravel the networkopathy in FTLD. To disentangle this issue longitudinal studies on large FTLD cohorts taking into account of different parameters (e.g., disease duration, disease severity, slow-fast disease course) are certainly needed.",

      "text": "In conclusion, although we cannot provide data about the actual neuropathology of FTLD patients included in the study, we offer a comprehensive in vivo evidence of the multifaceted alteration affecting the microstructure of white-matter bundles in the three main FTLD subtypes, with particular attention to the involvement of the CST. Overall, our data reveal the presence of motor system degeneration in FTLD, in most cases not accompanied by clinical and neurophysiological evidence.\nThe presence of such subtle white-matter microstructural alterations in FTLD may be due to the spread of the pathological process, and seems not directly associated to the development of MND. Importantly, the present study further underlined the role of DTI, and the derived metrics, in detecting in a non-invasive way neuroimaging signature of subclinical pathological changes affecting white-matter microstructure in FTLD.\nFinally, given the high variance of survival in FTLD, mainly depending on disease subtype and association with motor symptoms, future longitudinal studies will be crucial to address multilevel e i.e., clinical, neurophysiological, neuroimaging e changes and progression of FTLD pathology over time and to provide clinicians with precious data about disease propagation, as well as an advanced knowledge about multi-level substrates of MNDys in FTLD.",

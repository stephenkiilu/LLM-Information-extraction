    "abstract": "In vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on the quinolinic acid (QUIN) rat model of Huntingtons disease, together with behavioral assessment of motor deficits and histopathological characterization. DTI and histology revealed the presence of a cortical lesion in 53 of the QUIN animals (QUIN ϩctx ). Histologically, QUIN ϩctx were distinguished from QUIN Ϫctx animals by increased astroglial reaction within a subregion of the caudate putamen and loss of white matter in the external capsula. Although both techniques are complementary, the quantitative character of DTI makes it possible to pick up subtle differences in tissue microstructure that are not identified with histology. DTI demonstrated differential changes of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) in the internal and external capsula, and within a subregion of the caudate putamen. It was suggested that FA increased due to a selective loss of the subcortical connections targeted by degenerative processes at the early stage of the disease, which might turn the striatum into a seemingly more organized structure. When tissue degeneration becomes more severe, FA decreased while AD, RD and MD increased.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a late onset, autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by a triad of progressive cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms. At a molecular level, the disease is caused by an extended CAG (Cytosine Adenine Guanine) repeat within the HD gene, resulting in a widespread neuronal degeneration of the striatum, followed by cortical dysfunction (The Huntingtons Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993;Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998).\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly applied to characterize macro-as well as microscopical struc-tural changes in the brain of symptomatic HD patients and is proving valuable in similar investigations of presymptomatic HD patients (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2004;Tai et al., 2007b;Thieben et al., 2002;Vymazal et al., 2007). Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown to be a very potent tool to detect changes in the corticostriatal network of both symptomatic and presymptomatic HD patients (Bohanna et al., 2008;Rosas et al., 2006;Weaver et al., 2009), to our knowledge no DTI studies have been performed on animal models of HD yet. Nevertheless, imaging of animal models that mimic some of the neurobiological and clinical aspects of the disease, offer the opportunity to unravel the pathological mechanisms underlying the modified DTI parameters (Underwood et al., 2006), as animal models enable the use of complementary ex vivo tools.\nIn the present study we chose the well known quinolinic acid (QUIN) rat model of HD (Schwarcz et al., 1984). QUIN is an endogenous agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors that induces excitotoxicity by sustained receptor activation, resulting in cytotoxic increased cytosolic Ca 2ϩ concentrations (Aguilera et al., 2007;Estrada Sanchez et al., 2008;Schwarcz et al., 1984). Intrastriatal administration of the neurotoxin QUIN causes relative selective degeneration of the medium-sized projection neurons and a relative sparing of striatal interneurons (Beal et al., 1991;Brouillet et al., 1999;Nicholson et al., 1995;Shear et al., 1998). This experimental model offers several advantages, among them a well controllable striatal lesion and thus disease severity, of which the associated molecular and cellular changes are well characterized (Schwarcz et al., 2009).\nIn the present study, we performed a detailed in vivo DTI study on the QUIN rat model of HD, together with behavioral assessment of the motor deficits and histological characterization of the lesion in post-mortem brain tissue. The aim of the study was to determine whether in vivo DTI measurements provide a tool for non-invasive quantification of brain alterations in the QUIN rat model of HD. To that end, we performed group analysis of the DTI parametric images using a voxel-based approach and quantification of the DTI parameters by segmentation of predefined regions of interest. The microstructural changes, observed in vivo by DTI, were then validated and correlated with histological data, to unravel the pathological mechanisms. This is the first extensive DTI study on the QUIN rat model of HD, demonstrating the strength of DTI to detect microstructural changes, which are difficult and time-consuming to quantify using only classical histological tools.",

Animals were housed four per cage and kept under controlled conditions (12 hour light dark cycle and 22 Ϯ 2 C), with free access to food and water. For surgery, rats (n ϭ 27) were anesthetized with halothane (4 induction and 1.5 maintenance) administered in synthetic air at a rate of 1.5 mlmin, and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). A single hole was drilled in the skull at the level of the left caudate putamen (CPu). A stainless steel guide cannula (27 gauge) with a polyethylene tube (PE10) positioned at the top, was slowly lowered into the CPu (coordinates relative to bregma: anteroposterior ϩ 0.2 mm; lateral ϩ 2.8 mm and dorsoventral Ϫ4.5 mm (Paxinos and Watson, 2006). The tube was connected to a Hamilton syringe of 10 l mounted in an infusion pump (BAS, Bee syringe pump MF-9090). Animals were infused with a single injection of 1 l of QUIN (n QUIN ϭ 22, 240 nmol) or phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) (sham, n sham ϭ 14) adjusted to pH 7.4 at an infusion rate of 0.5 lmin. After infusion, the cannula was left in place for an additional 5 minutes before being slowly removed. A group of five animals was not injected and was used as the control group.",

The severity of the lesion was assessed by two behavioral tests: (1) exploratory activity (EA) and (2) amphetamine rotation test. To that end, PBS-or QUIN-infused rats were placed individually in black cages (polyglass, 35.5 cm 3 , uniformly illuminated in a temperature and humidity controlled soundproof room. A video camera took an aerial view of the cages and animal behavior was digitally-recorded (Videotrack, 2000, View Point, Lyon). EA was defined as the initial displacement of the animal after being placed in a new environment and was measured during a 5 minute session, considering all the ambulatory movement with a speed greater than 12 cms (Gimenez-Llort et al., 1995). Exploratory activity ratio (EAr) was calculated as the ratio of EA measured during the second week versus the first week after injection. A similar setup was used for the amphetamine rotation test at Day 28 (Vivo et al., 2002). QUIN as well as sham animals were intraperitoneally injected with amphetamine (4 mgkg free base; amphetamine was generously supplied by the Ministry of Health, Spain) and rotational asymmetry was automatically monitored 5 minutes after amphetamine administration, over a period of 30 minutes counting the numbers of ipsilateral (towards the lesion side) and contralateral (towards the nonlesion side) movements. Subsequently, differences between ipsiand contralateral rotations (Figure 1, AMPH rot (I-c)) were calculated to evaluate the severity of the lesion.",

During the experiments, rats were breathing spontaneously and respiration rate was mea-sured using a small animal respiration pad (MR-compatible Small Animal Monitoring and Gating System, SA Instruments, Inc.) and kept constant at approximately 60 breaths per minute by adjusting the anesthesia level. Body temperature, measured with a rectal probe, was kept constant at 37 C using a feed-back coupled warm air system (MRcompatible Small Animal Heating System, SA Instruments, Inc.). The rats head was immobilized in flat-scull position using a home-made MR-compatible stereotactic device, by fixing the head with blunt ear plugs and a movable tooth bar. A small home-made 30 mm Helmholtz-like coil was used as a combination of transmit and receive coil. High resolution DTI imaging was performed on a 7 Tesla Bruker Pharmascan (Ettlingen, Germany), imaging the entire rat brain (25 slices horizontal slices, in plane resolution: 0.117 ϫ 0.117 mm 2 , slice thickness: 0.43 mm) using a conventional diffusion-weighted 2D spin echo sequence (TR: 2200 ms, TE: 43 ms, FOV: 30 ϫ 30 mm 2 , NEX 14, acquisition matrix: 256 ϫ 128, zero filled to 256 ϫ 256).

To further improve the quality of the spatial normalization, thus, to increase the reliability of the VBS, all subjects were warped onto a study-specific populationbased DTI atlas using a nonrigid coregistration technique (Van Hecke et al., 2007;Van Hecke et al., 2009). In this coregistration algorithm, the images were modeled as a viscous fluid whose deformation were constraint by a simplified Navier Stokes equation (DAgostino et al., 2003). The calculation of the deformation fields was driven by all tensor information during image alignment to reduce local misalignments in the WM tracts.\nThe construction of the study-specific population-based DTI atlas was based on the methodology proposed by Van Hecke (Van Hecke et al., 2009), which is characterized by a minimal magnitude of the deformation fields that are needed to warp the different images to the atlas and the lack of a bias to a specific topology. Subsequently, VBS (t-test) was performed on the different tensor invariant parameter maps (Axial DiffusivityϪAD, Radial DiffusivityϪRD , Fractional AnisotropyϪFA, Mean DiffusivityϪMD) between the control, sham, and QUIN groups, using SPM8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspm). The significance maps show, for each individual DTI-parameter, the clusters of voxels (Ͼ 20) that are significantly different between the groups at the level of p Ͻ 0.001.

Brains were removed, postfixed overnight in the same fixative at 4 C, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. The brains were cut in coronal slices at striatal level ϩ 0.2 and Ϫ0.4 mm from bregma according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson, using a microtome (Leica, Microsystems, Wetzelar, Germany) (Aguilera et al., 2007). The location and the extent of the damage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Luxol fast blue staining for white matter tracts with Nissl counter stain was used to visualize myelin and neural cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity was evaluated as well, to determine the degree of striatal dopamine denervation. A mouse monoclonal antibody against TH (Chemicon, USA) was diluted at 1 : 100 in PBS. The sections were made permeable by boiling citrate buffer. Immunohistochemistry against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a specific marker of astroglial cells) and lectin staining (a marker of reactive microgliamacrophages) was carried out to reveal signs of glial reaction. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFAP (Dako, Dakopats, USA) was diluted at 1 : 500 in PBS containing 0.3 Triton-X. Biotinylated lectin from Lycopersicon Esculetum (tomato) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a concentration of 2.5 gmL of PBS containing 0.2 Triton-X and 0.2 gelatin. The immunocytochemical procedure has been described elsewhere (Vivo et al., 2002). Briefly, sections were rehydrated and incubated overnight with the corresponding primary antibody or the biotinylated lectin in a humidified chamber at 4 C. The sections processed for TH or GFAP immunoreactivity were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the appropriate biotinylated second antibodies, diluted 1 : 200 (goat antimouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively) (Vector Laboratories, USA). All sections were incubated with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex 1 : 100 (ABC kit, Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour.

Brain volumes, assessed on B 0 images, revealed a reduction of the striatal volume of 40 Ϯ 9. In the ipsilateral striatum, a hyperintense area on B 0 and T 2 -weighted images, corresponding to a hypo intense area on histology, surrounded the injection site and was defined as lesioned CPu or Les-CPu. Les-CPu covered almost three-fourth of the volume of the ipsilateral CPu 71 Ϯ 19. Peripheral to the Les-CPu, a third region was defined as the Peri-CPu that covered 29 Ϯ 19 of the ipsilateral CPu.\nFurthermore, in 9 out of 17 animals (prevalence of approximately 53), at the level of the ipsilateral ctx, a hyper intense area could be discerned with MRI, corresponding to a severely lesioned (hypo intense) area in histology. The volume of this cortical lesion ranged from 12 to 23 mm 3 , but its size was independent of the size of the Les-CPu.\nTo evaluate whether differential microstructural neurodegenerative changes are associated with this cortical lesion, the QUIN group was separated in a QUIN ϩctx (n ϭ 9) and QUIN Ϫctx (n ϭ 8) group, which was indicative for respectively the presence or absence of a lesion in the ctx.\nIn addition, no signs of striatal or cortical lesions were detected in the sham animals that received an intrastriatal injection of PBS.",

This difference between the QUIN group and sham animals was no longer present 4 weeks after injection (p ϾϾ 0.05) (Figure 1A).\nAll the QUIN-infused animals displayed head nodding, circling behavior and rolling over, while sham animals were free of these behavioral components. One week after injection, the QUIN group displayed a modestly increased EA compared with the sham group (653 Ϯ 182 vs 312 Ϯ 44, p Ͻ 0.09). However, 2 weeks post injection, this trend disappeared (Figure 1B).

Animals with a cortical lesion showed strong atrophy of the frontoparietal cortex, determining cell loss in a wide area surrounded by a restricted zone of less damaged tissue. At a higher magnification (Figure 6), HE staining showed damage in the Les-CPu, which was characterized by massive involvement of necrotic cells with shrunken cytoplasm and condensed picnotic nuclei together with spongiosis. In the Peri-CPu, preserved but spongiotic zones were observed with a heterogeneous mixture of necrotic, shrunken cells and some preserved cells. Consequently, decreased TH immunoreactivity was seen in the ipsilateral hemisphere, compared with the contralateral hemisphere due to conspicuous neuronal loss within the damaged area (Les-CPu) (Figure 5B, TH). However, TH immunoreactivity was maintained in the area defined as Peri-CPu (Figure 6, TH), indicating preservation of dopaminergic terminals. Nevertheless, the Peri-CPu area showed enhanced GFAP immunostaining, revealing an in-creased astrocytic reactivity similar than that observed in the Les-CPu area. However, this was to a lower extent compared with the lack of reactivity seen on the contralateral hemisphere and sham animals, which indicates the strongest astroglial reaction in QUIN ϩctx animals (Figures 5 and6, GFAP). Increased microglial-macrophage activation, as illustrated by lectin staining, was detected in the Les-CPu area, whereas only discrete microglial activation was seen in Peri-CPu (Figures 5 and6). This pattern of CPu damage was similar in QUIN Ϫctx and QUIN ϩctx animals (Figure 5), suggesting that DTI can detect more subtle features of tissue alterations than gross histological evaluation.

    "Validity of the QUIN model": {
      "text": "The QUIN rat model of HD is a well known experimental model of HD, which mimics many of the neuro-anatomical characteristics of HD. In this study we demonstrated that DTI is a sensitive tool to quantitatively pick up subtle differences in tissue microstructure, which could not be visualized by the currently used histological tools.\nIn the striatum ipsilateral to the injection, several affected zones (Les-CPu, Peri-Cpu, and the injection spot) were discerned on anatomical MR images and confirmed by histology. These subdivisions have been described previously, both in rodent (Beal et al., 1991;Roberts et al., 1993) as well as in primate QUIN models (Ferrante et al., 1993). Within these affected zones, the DTI parameters changed differently because of different histopathological features of these subregions. Roberts et al. (1993) reported a lesion zone characterized by a massive neuronal loss, which occupied more than one-half to two-third of the striatum. This zone corresponded histologically as well as volumetrically to our observations of the Les-CPu (71.4 Ϯ 18 of the ipsilateral CPu). In addition to the lesion zone, a transition zone was identified in the QUIN model as a region of moderate neuronal loss, and abnormal cell morphology (Ferrante et al., 1993;Roberts et al., 1993). Our data obtained from the HE staining demonstrated that this zone corresponded to what we identified as the Peri-CPu. Moreover, we demonstrated that TH staining was almost abolished in the Les-CPu, whereas a positive reaction remained in the Peri-CPu, indicating the existence of afferent connections in the Peri-CPu. These observations agree with a previous study reporting preserved tyrosine and dopamine levels in the transition zone (Ferrante et al., 1993). In the present study an increased immunoreactivity, consisting of both microglial and astrocytic reactivity, was observed in the Peri-Cpu compared with the Les-Cpu. Indeed, astrogliosis has been described in the transition zone (Ferrante et al., 1993;Roberts et al., 1993), and more recently, microglial activity after QUIN injection has been demonstrated by in vivo pet ( 11 C-PK11195) imaging combined with in vitro immunocytochemistry (OX42) (Moresco et al., 2008). Although these authors did not subdivide the CPu in different regions, a maximal microglial activity was described in the ipsilateral CPu 30 days after injection, a time point which was comparable to the timing of our MRI measurement. More importantly, postmortem studies of HD patients also showed a significant accumulation of activated microglia in affected regions, such as the basal ganglia and the frontal cortex (Tai et al., 2007a;Tai et al., 2007b). Furthermore, the microglial density has been correlated with the severity of HD pathology, suggesting a close association between microglial activation and neuronal death (Sapp et al., 2001). All these findings demonstrate that the histopathological alterations in the Peri-CPu of the QUIN rat model closely resembles the pathology observed in HD (Ferrante et al., 1993).\nIn contrast to previous studies which reported that in the QUIN model the cortex was spared from neuronal damage (Ferrante et al., 1993;Roberts et al., 1993;Schwarcz et al., 1984), we observed a clear cortical lesion in approximately 53 of the animals, which was evidenced by both DTI and histology. Nevertheless, the QUIN dose (240 nmol) used in this study, was similar to doses reported in previous studies (Araujo et al., 2000;Moresco et al., 2008;Scattoni et al., 2004). To evaluate the influence of the cortical lesion on the behavioral, DTI and histological outcome, we divided the QUIN animals in a QUIN Ϫctx and QUIN ϩctx group, which were individually compared with sham and control animals.",

    "DTI as a tool to quantify microstructural changes": {
      "text": "The behavioral studies did not distinguish QUIN Ϫctx from QUIN ϩctx animals. This is probably because the tests used rather provide a quantitative assessment of the striatal lesion (Schwarcz et al., 2009), which was similarly affected in all QUIN animals. Another plausible explanation is that the same network at the cortical and subcortical or just at the subcortical level might be disrupted. However, the behavioral tests used in the present study do not provide feed-back on the functioning of the corticostriatal network. Surprisingly, with the exception of the cortical lesion, the histological data hardly distinguished QUIN Ϫctx from QUIN ϩctx animals. Only at the level of the ec, a more pronounced inflammatory reaction and fiber loss was observed in QUIN ϩctx animals. In contrast, in vivo DTI enabled to discriminate QUIN Ϫctx from QUIN ϩctx animals based on a differential pattern of the DTI parameters in the Peri-CPu, ctx, ic and ec of QUIN Ϫctx vs QUIN ϩctx animals. Especially in the Peri-CPu, the DTI parameters were remarkably different between QUIN Ϫctx and QUIN Ϫctx animals, with increased FA in the QUIN Ϫctx and increased RD and MD in the QUIN ϩctx animals. These data indicate that the characteristics of the Peri-CPu, a region which seemed similar between QUIN Ϫctx and QUIN ϩctx animals according to histological analyses, might indicate the presence of a cortical lesion.\nBoth in the lesioned ctx and in the Les-CPu of QUIN ϩctx animals, AD, RD and MD were increased compared with the ipsilateral ctx and the Peri-CPu of QUIN Ϫctx animals. Interestingly, FA was increased in the Peri-CPu, the ctx, ic and ec of the QUIN Ϫctx , while it was decreased in the same GFAP reactivity was highly increased, showing hypertrophic astrocytes. Tomato Lectin, staining microglial cells and also blood vessels, shows an important microglia-macrophage activation with cells showing an ameboid shape. In the Peri-CPu, neurons are preserved but shrunken and tissue shows spongiosis compared with the contralateral side. However, the level of TH immunoreactivity was almost normal compared with the intact hemisphere. GFAP reactivity also showed hypertrophic astrocytes but in a lesser density than that observed in Les-CPu. Lectin staining shows microglial cells with ramified morphology reminding that of the contralateral side. Bar, 50 m.\nstructures of QUIN ϩctx rats. Increased FA has previously been reported in the putamen and globus pallidus of both symptomatic and presymptomatic HD patients, and has been related to pathological processes that modify tissue integrity, such as neuronal remodeling and loss, and secondary astrocytosis (Douaud et al., 2009;Kloppel et al., 2008;Rosas et al., 2006). Histological data showed that fibrillary astrocytosis was clearly more manifest in the Peri-CPu than the Les-CPu, however this was not coincided with a significantly increased FA in the Peri-CPu compared with Les-CPu. In addition, astrogliosis was not observed in the ctx of QUIN Ϫctx animals and thus could not account for its increase in FA. Douaud et al. (Douaud et al., 2009) suggested that the selective loss of the subcortical connections targeted by the degenerative process, i.e. mainly the striato-pallidal projections at the early stage of the disease, may turn the striatum into a seemingly more organized structure. However at more severe stages when all the tracts are affected, FA decreases. If we assume that QUIN Ϫctx animals represent an earlier pathological stage than QUIN ϩctx rats, this might explain the FA observations in the present study. The interpretation of a change in FA however, is not straightforward, especially in gray matter, due to its dependence on the different eigenvalues. Acosta-Cabronero and colleagues (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010) suggested that FA is not the appropriate metric to study neurodegenerative processes. Indeed FA may lack sensitivity if water diffusion changes proportionally along the direction of all three eigenvectors. In the present study concomitant increases of AD, RD and MD were observed in various ROI. Increased and QUIN -ctx rats and compared with the contralateral intact hemisphere (Contra). The morphology of the corpus callosum (cc) of QUIN ϩctx and QUIN -ctx animals is unaltered and no GFAP immunoreactivity is observed in this structure. In contrast, in the ipsilateral ec and ic, of both QUIN ϩctx and QUIN -ctx rats, a loss of structure in white matter fibers and an increased GFAP immunoreactivity was observed, compared with the structured fibers and basal GFAP reactivity of the contralateral side. However, the disruption of white mater fiber morphology, as well as the density of hypertrophic astrocytes, was greater in QUIN ϩctx than in QUIN -ctx . Bar in A: 5 mm; in B: 50 m.\nMD has previously been reported in the caudate and putamen of HD patients and was likely to be caused by the expansion of the extracellular space, corresponding to a decrease in membrane density due to cell degeneration. Another plausible explanation would be that the loss of the projections of the medium spiny neurons, and neuronal shrinking results in an increase in MD (Douaud et al., 2009).\nIn the white matter of QUIN ϩctx animals, an increase of RD, and concomitant FA decrease, are suggestive for axonal damage and myelin injury of the white matter tracts in the advanced pathological stage (Song et al., 2004;Sun et al., 2005;Sun et al., 2006). The local increase of AD, hypothesized to relate to axonal genesisinjurydegeneration, suggests that the loss of WM integrity is not due to axonal degeneration, but relates to demyelinization, supporting the notion that in HD WM degeneration is not merely a consequence of GM loss (Stoffers et al., 2010). Although rare, increases in AD have previously been reported in a clinical study on HD and Alzheimers disease patients (Rosas et al., 2010;Salat et al., 2010).\nBudde and colleagues demonstrated that the relationship between demyelination and radial diffusivity is somewhat more complicated for a variety of reasons (Budde et al., 2009). For instance, it has not been well defined whether radial diffusivity is specific to demyelination in the presence of significant axonal damage (Sun et al., 2005;Sun et al., 2006) or inflammation. Although the connection between radial diffusivity and demyelination has been shown in several demyelinating models, radial diffusivity may not be as specific in the presence of other pathological changes (Kim et al., 2006;Song et al., 2003;Sun et al., 2006). Indeed histology showed unstructured fibers but also an increased GFAP immunoreactivity in the ec of QUIN ϩctx animals. MD and anisotropy changes in white matter have been suggested to reflect the remote damage resulting from the primary insults top gray matter (Xu et al., 2008).\nConsequently, in complex diseases, such as HD, brain regions may experience an unpredictable combination of demyelination, axon loss, gliosis, and inflammation, which could result in competing influences on the diffusion tensor. Nonetheless, the interpretation of changes in the measured diffusion tensor is complex and should be performed with care (Alexander et al., 2007).",

    "VBS vs ROI analysis": {
      "text": "During the preprocessing, an advanced coregistration algorithm was used to limit coregistration artifacts at the level of the degenerating brain structures. Although this significantly increased the quality of the VBS data, the results of especially the Peri-CPu and Les-CPu, still need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, these subregions displayed a relatively large volumetric variation within the QUIN Ϫctx and QUIN ϩctx group (variance Peri-CPu and Les-CPu ϭ 14 -15 mm 3 ), and a similar observation was made for the lesioned cortex within the QUIN ϩctx animals (variance ϭ 21 mm 3 ).\nNonetheless, VBS and ROI analyses are complementary approaches that ensure that the results are not driven by registration artifacts, and that subtle changes in tissue structures that would be averaged out by ROI analysis are picked up.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In conclusion, in the present parallel DTI-histolopathogical study in the QUIN model of HD, we were able to detect more subtle changes in the affected structures with DTI compared with histology. This emphasizes the strength of DTI as a highly sensitive and quantitative imaging method to detect neurodegenerative changes at a microstructural and subcellular level. However, in HD, brain regions experience a combination of demyelination, axon loss, gliosis and inflammation, and thus the interpretation of changes in the measured diffusion tensor is complex as DTI parameters often reflect a combination of microstructural and subcellular changes. Therefore, histology remains indispensable for a complete interpretation and understanding of the imaging data.\nFinally, the QUIN model of HD is a lesion model showing clear neurodegenerative changes, but no protein aggregates. Therefore, it will be interesting to apply a similar approach in transgenic rodent models of HD that progressively show protein aggregates followed by eventual neuronal cell death to study the effect of protein aggregates on the DT parameter changes.",

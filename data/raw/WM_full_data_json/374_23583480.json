    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the number of AD patients have been increasing in recent years. AD shows symptoms of memory impairment and disturbance in orientation in its early stage, and then shows further higher brain dysfunction, such as visuospatial disturbance and executive dysfunction with disease progression. AD shows brain atrophy with disease progression. In imaging studies of AD, it has been shown that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures become atrophied in the early stage, and further atrophy progressively spreads to the neocortical regions. Although AD is considered to affect mainly the cortical gray matter, pathological changes are also observed in the white matter, such as the loss of axons and oligodendrocytes together with reactive astrocytosis (Kobayashi et al., 2002;Roth et al., 2005). The executive function is consequent on activating the interaction across the several cortical regions, and it is considered that white matter abnormalities are related to the various cognitive dysfunction (Delbeuck et al., 2007;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Bozzali et al., 2011). Therefore, the neural connectivities across brain regions are important to comprehend the pathophysiology of AD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on evaluating the random motion of water molecules, and can noninvasively examine neural microstructural tissue organization. In region of interest (ROI) analysis, microstructural damage is shown in the frontal, temporal regions or in the hippocampus in AD (Chen et al., 2009;Hong et al., 2010). The voxel-based morphometric analysis (VBA) in AD is known to show abnormality in the medial temporal structure and the hippocampus (Di. Paola et al., 2007;Rose et al., 2008). Furthermore, the tractbased analysis, which extracts the diffusion parameters along the reconstructed white matter bundles, shows microstructural damage in the uncinate fasciculus, cingulated fasciculus, and the corpus callosum (Kiuchi et al., 2009;Nakata et al., 2008;Pievani et al., 2010;Yasmin et al., 2008). Also, AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and shows atrophic changes and various clinical symptoms with disease progression. Matsuda et al. (2002) reported that progressive medial temporal lobe atrophy in a 3 dimension-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up study was investigated in AD patients. Taken together, the research on longitudinal white matter changes would be important to understand AD pathophysiology. However, to the best of our knowledge, a follow-up DTI study for white matter changes in AD has not been conducted.\nIn this study, we followed AD patients from the early stage to the moderate, and investigated their longitudinal white matter changes with disease progression. In the course of AD, pathological neuronal change begins in the medial temporal regions such as enthorhinal cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampus, which subsequently spreads to the neocortical regions with temporal, parietal and frontal cortex (Braak and Braak, 1995). Thus, pathological alterations in AD occur in temporal regions of the brain. Therefore, in recent study, we investigated three major white matter bundles, the uncinate fasciculus (UNC), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (IOFF). The UNC is considered to play an important role in memory and cognition (Highley et al., 2002), and the ILF and IOFF are related to executive functions such as emotional process, object cognition, verbal and visual memory and visuospatial cognition (Chanraud et al., 2010;Kiuchi et al., 2010;Kringelbach, 2005). We hypothesized that the disruption in major white matter bundles can cause memory impairment or high cognitive impairments, and the connectivity of white matter tracts is impaired with disease progression.\nIn this study, we employed tract-based analysis to examine microstructural white matter changes with several major tracts in AD patients. Tract based analysis assembles the local diffusion tensor data into tracts using scalar metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Furthermore, the coordinates of the tensor matrix can be diagonalized to extract the three eigenvalues; λ 1, λ 2, and λ 3 derived from the main eigenvectors of diffusion elements. The combination of these eigenvalues defines diffusion parameters, the axial diffusivity (D A ), in parallel with axon fibers, and radial diffusivity (D R ), perpendicular to axon fibers (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1998;Song et al., 2002;Sun et al., 2005). Thus, tract-based analysis can evaluate the specific anatomical localization of a single tract and allow measurement throughout the length of the bundles.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The present study explored the white matter microstructural abnormalities in AD patients with disease progression using tractography-based analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where AD patients were followed and assessed for longitudinal changes of their white matter bundles. In this study, we found mean FA reduction of the bilateral UNC in the course of clinical follow-up among AD patients. In addition, compared with normal controls, white matter microstructural changes in ILF and IOFF were observed in AD patients. Furthermore, examining the b r a i n r e s e a r c h 1 5 1 5 ( 2 0 1 3 ) 1 2 -1 8 diffusivity, we found increase of mean radial diffusivity in the bilateral UNC with AD disease progression.\nIt is known that the UNC connects the orbitofrontal cortex in the frontal lobe and anterior part of the temporal lobe, and plays an important role in memory and cognition (Highley et al., 2002). There have been previous reports of abnormality of the UNC in AD (Taoka et al., 2006;Yasmin et al., 2008). Yasmin et al. reported that AD patients showed a significant FA reduction in the bilateral UNC compared with healthy controls using tract-specific analysis, and Taoka et.al found a significant FA reduction and ADC increase in AD rather than in normal controls using a tract of interest method (Taoka et al., 2006;Yasmin et al., 2008). These results were consistent with our present study. Furthermore, we followed the AD patients and found FA reduction of the UNC with disease progression. This is consistent with a previous study which reported that the FA value of the UNC was positively correlated with the MMSE score and negatively correlated with the ADAS-Cog score in AD with DTI analysis (Morikawa et al., 2010). In AD pathology, the pathophysiological change occurs in the early AD stage in the MTL, which includes the transentorhinal region, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, which subsequently spreads to the temporal, parietal and frontal cortex in the disease course (Braak and Braak, 1995). Thus, it is suggested that progressive disruption of the UNC fiber reflects the pathological change due to deterioration in AD which may underlie AD pathophysiology.\nIn contrast, we found that there was no significant FA reduction or ADC increase in the ILF and the IOFF between baseline and follow-up period. On the other hand, AD patients were found to have significant FA reduction or ADC increase in the ILF of the IOFF compared with normal controls. In previous studies, the diffusion abnormalities of the ILF or the IOFF in AD have been reported, which were consistent with our recent data (Cho et al., 2008;Fellgiebel et al., 2008;Stricker et al., 2009). The ILF connects the occipital lobe with the anterior part of the temporal lobe, and anteriorly joins the UNC to relay information to the orbitofrontal cortex (Catani et al., 2003). Meanwhile, the IOFF connects the occipital, posterior temporal, and the orbitofrontal areas, and also contains fibers that connect the frontal lobe with the posterior part of the parietal and temporal lobes (Taoka et al., 2006). It has been suggested that the ILF and the IOFF are associated with object recognition, visual spatial processing, visual and verbal memory, and visual emotional process (Chanraud et al., 2010;Kiuchi et al., 2010;Kringelbach, 2005). In the course of AD, patients show symptoms of memory impairment and disorientation in the early phase, and consecutively show cognitive decline such as emotional, visuospatial disturbance and loss of executive function. In this study, we observed gradual FA decrease and ADC increase in the ILF and IOFF from normal controls to baseline and follow-up AD patients, which suggested that the progressive microstructural damages to the ILF and the IOFF might be associated with cognitive decline in AD pathology.\nConsidering the diffusion analysis, we found significant increase in radial diffusivity in UNC among the follow-up rather than baseline among AD patients. Therefore, it was shown to increase the radial diffusivity in ILF and IOFF in AD patients compared with normal controls. In this study, we identified greater increase of radial diffusivity than that of axial diffusivity with disease progression. The previous DTI studies in AD showed an increase of radial diffusivity (Huang b r a i n r e s e a r c h 1 5 1 5 ( 2 0 1 3 ) 1 2 -1 8\net al., 2007;Salat et al., 2010). This is consistent with our recent examination. Salat et al. reported an increase of radial diffusivity in the medial temporal, occipital, and precuneus in DTI analysis. Moreover, Stricker et al. reported that an increase of radial diffusion reflects a loss of myelin integrity and neural demyelination (Stricker et al., 2009). Progressive white matter axonal demyelination underlies AD pathology, resulting in critical disturbances in neural condition, and thus severely damaging brain function (Roher et al., 2002). Taking these studies together, we considered that our data might reflect these white matter pathological changes in AD.\nThere are some limitations to the current study. The first limitation is the measurement protocol for diffusion tensor imaging. We applied a 6-axis diffusion encoding gradient, which is a small number for diffusion encoding (Jones, 2004). Because the AD subjects in this study had several problems in their cognitive functions, we needed to set shorter imaging time by using smaller number of diffusion encoding. Furthermore, there is a study which describes that the number of diffusion encoding does not exert any significant effect of visualization of the optic radiation (Yamamoto et al., 2007). This is also the reason for the number of diffusion encoding gradients. The second limitation is that the DTI images were obtained using a 1.5-Tesla MRI system, relatively weak magnetic fields, and the number of participants was comparatively small. We considered that future studies should include a larger number of participants using higher-field MRI system. The third limitation is that the follow-up period among AD patients was incongruent. In this study, AD patients were followed between one and three years. However, in this study, cognitive function in each AD patient did not get worse with disease progression, from mild to moderate stage, and so we thought that there was no remarkable cognitive fluctuation among follow up of the AD patients due to the incongruent follow up period. The fourth limitation is that AD patients in this study were administered choline esterase inhibitors, which might affect somewhat the diffusion measures. We would investigate it in our future analysis. b r a i n r e s e a r c h 1 5 1 5 ( 2 0 1 3 ) 1 2 -1 8\nIn conclusion, we examined the longitudinal evaluation of the microstructural white matter changes in AD patients with DTI tractography analysis. We found diffusion abnormalities in the major white matter bundles with disease progression, which may reflect white matter changes in AD pathology. Therefore, quantifying the histopathological changes to white matter may be a useful biological marker for monitoring AD.",

Assessment of cognitive function was examined according to a standardized cognitive battery of tests, including the MMSE and the ADAS-Cog., the reliability and validity of which have previously been confirmed in Japan (Homma et al., 1992).

Exclusion criteria for all of the subjects were a history of substantial head injury, seizures, neurological diseases, impaired thyroid function, and corticosteroid use. Subjects with cortical infarctions on T-2 weighted images were also excluded, whereas subjects with small lacunae in the white matter (fewer than 5 lesions on T2-weighted images) were included.

Interpolation along the z-axis was performed to obtain isotropic data (voxel size, 0.89 Â 0.89 Â 0.89 mm). The eigen vector associated with the largest eigenvalue or the principal axis was assumed to represent the local fiber direction. The tracking algorithm moved along the principal axis. The diffusion tensor at the next location was determined from the adjacent voxels, and its principal axis was subsequently estimated. Tracking lines were traced in this way, and propagated in both anterograde and retrograde directions until the FA fell below an assigned threshold. The settings for each tractography were as follows: the FA threshold for tracking was set at 0.18, the stop length was set at 160 steps and the seed and target ROIs are given in Table 4. Using these data, we delineated the bilateral UNC, ILF and IOFF (Fig. 1).\nThe dTV II software has a function that calculates the mean FA, mean ADC (10 -3 smm 2 ), mean D A (10 -3 smm 2 ) and mean D R (10 -3 smm 2 ) along the constructed tract.

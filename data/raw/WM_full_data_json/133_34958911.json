    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) leads to substantial disability. Unlike external manifestations such as tremor, the decay of cognitive function is often an underlying process, and its neuroanatomic substrates are not yet fully elucidated. Knowledge regarding cognitive-related alterations in white matter (WM) pathways helps us understand the mechanisms of cognitive decline in patients with PD. Previous voxel-based analyses with Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have uncovered white matter differences in groupwise, but the conclusions were inconsistent. That was partially due to white matter fibers that are known to affect cognition, such as the corpus callosum (CC) and superior longitudinal fasciculus that cross in voxel, and are hard to interpreted by the abovementioned metrics. Furthermore, cognitive decay is a continuous process, it is difficult to reflect the continuous changes of white matter fibers between groups comparison. In the present work, we chose the constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and the fixel model, which avoided the effect of crossing fibers. To compare the white matter fiber in different cognitive stages of patients with PD, the results found that the CC, the cingulum bundle (CB), and the corticospinal tract (CST) showed the same trend in the decline of cognitive function, and this change may lead to the impairment of cognitive function. Our findings can help physicians determine the cognitive stage of PD from the perspective of white matter fiber and provide a reference for clinical trials and predictions.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily manifesting motor and non-motor dysfunction with cognitive impairment as a key non-motor comorbid symptom. Previous studies highlighted that up to 50 of people suffer cognitive symptoms during PD 1. Based on the different stages of cognitive impairment, patients with Parkinson disease are classified into four categories: PD with normal cognitive (PD-NC), PD with cognitive complaints (PD-CC), PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD). PD patients who express subjective cognitive complaints are at higher risk of developing PD-MCI 2, the majority of these patients with long cognitive symptoms will suffer from PDD 3. The neural substrates of cognitive decline in patients with PD are incompletely understood 4. A growing body of evidence has suggested that changes in brain circuits underlie cognitive impairment 5. Therefore, studying alterations in WM fiber tracts may help us better understand the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD and provide more treatment opportunities.\nDiffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the only noninvasive method for studying WM fiber architecture in vivo and is widely used in clinical practice. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) can quantify the extent of water molecule diffusion through assessing metrics (such as FA, MD) to study the integrity and directionality in the WM structure. In the voxel-or fiber-based analysis, these assessing metrics could be used for quantitative comparisons to demonstrate correlation with intergroup differences or disease symptoms. Several DTI studies have reported abnormal microstructure of WM fibers in patients with PD, these abnormalities in the WM might be associated with cognitive deficits 6,7, attention 7, visuospatial skills 8 and depression stage 9. The existing studies 7,8 have found WM alterations in different stages of patients with PD with cognitive impairment by DTI metrics. Specifically, Tracy R. Melzer et al. (2013) compared TBSS-based measures among study cohorts. Their results suggested only a tiny region with significant differences was observed when compared PD-NC with the advanced stages 8. Later, Ian O. Bledsoe et al. (2018) conducted a comparative study of CC using the DTI metrics among cohort studies. The comparison demonstrated that PDD had significantly increased MD in the anterior two segments compared to PD-NC and in the most anterior segments compared to participants with PD-MCI 7.\nDespite the promising results revealing WM abnormalities in Parkinson disease, the voxel-based analyses with DTI measures still have some shortcomings such as crossing-fiber populations, which are present in up to 90 of WM voxels 10. A recent technique that enables fiber tract-specific statistical analysis called fixel-based analysis (FBA), which can estimate the orientations of multiple fiber populations within one voxel, and an analysis based on fiber orientation rather than averaging within voxels 11. Moreover, fiber-based WM fiber analysis has been",

We used the dwi2response script to obtain the single-shell response functions 19, then the WM response function of all participants needed to be averaged and FODs were estimated by the CSD model on each dMRI data 20. Ten FODs were randomly selected from each category to generate a study-specific population unbiased FOD template (totally used 410 FOD images). All steps were conducted using commands implemented within MRtrix3 (www.mrtrix.org).\nA tractogram was generated using whole-brain IFOD2 tractography based on the FOD model. Twenty million streamlines were generated, and these were subsequently filtered to two million streamlines using the SIFT (spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms) algorithm to improve the fit between the streamline reconstruction and the dMRI 21. Based on the tractography, a study-specific group-wise fiber clustering was conducted using this well-established pipeline to parcellate the whole-brain tractography into 800 clusters 22. Considering the hemisphere laterality may exist in PD 23, we segmented the whole brain fibers into left brain, right brain, and commissural.\nTo perform an analysis on segmented bundles, we used the BUAN method, which is flexible and can be adopted for many sorts of data 24. We can get a segment index on every streamline of each bundle by generating the cluster centroid, calculating the Euclidean distance between each point and cluster centroid, and assigning the points to the nearest center of the cluster centroid. We obtained the index value of all points on each streamline corresponding to the segment, and all points in the same segment will take the average 24. By matching the coordinate of the tracts with fixel metrics calculated before, we obtained the averaged fixel value of each segment on the specific bundle for the subsequent statistical analysis.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In the present study, we have used the fixel-based metrics and the atlas method to investigate fiber tract-specific WM alterations with various cognitive dysfunction to shed light on the underlying causes of cognitive impairment in PD. Alterations in WM microstructure and macrostructure were found in specific fiber. Specifically, FD in left CB (cluster 682) and FDC in the body of CC (cluster 315) was consistently decreased, while FD in right CST (cluster 173 and 238) was consistently increased. These WM alterations were consistent with the cognitive stage trends of PD and were associated with motor and other non-motor symptoms. These findings may pave the way towards novel preventive and diagnostic strategies and help us understand brain-circuit changes of PD.\nThe CB is a prominent WM fiber that interconnects with the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal sites. Clinical studies reveal CB abnormalities in numerous conditions, including dysfunction and dementia 27, mild Cognitive Impairment 28. The major reductions in WM were observed in left CB, reflecting axonal loss at the microstructure level. It can be seen that PDD has a smaller fiber density compared to the first three stages of impaired cognitive function, and a considerable number of nodes have substantial significant differences (p  0.001, -logp  2). These results confirmed the observation in previous studies 7 where increased MD and reduction FA in CB were detected in PDD compared with PD without Dementia. We also found a significant positive correlation between the mean FD values of the CB and MOCA, indicating that cognitive impairment in PD patients may be induced by left CB degeneration.\nThe CC, which carries most of the axonal connections from one side of the neocortex to the opposite side, is the enormous commissural connection between the two sides of the cerebral hemisphere. The body of the CC, transited by the transcallosal motor fibers, is a vital motorrelated area pathogenetically involved in PD 29. We noticed that the late degeneration of WM in the CC body is more severe than the previous cognitive stage, which suggested a significant attenuation in the ability to transmit information at the CC during PDD. A previous study also showed abnormalities of the body that were induced by injury and associated with cognitive function 30. There was a significant negative correlation between the UPDRS-III scores, which indicates that fiber density values at the body of the CC may have a significant effect on motor performance, and this is consistent with the previous findings 7.\nWe also found that the FD of right CST (cluster 238 and 173) in PDD has a higher FD value than the other three situations. These alterations in CST were rarely reported in PD patients, DTI studies of PD have used voxel-based analyses 31,28 and skeleton-based analyses 32, but both failed to find a CST abnormality. However, among the three existing fixel-based studies of PD patients, two studies find higher FD in the CST when compared PD with control. This may occur be because fixel-based methods are more sensitive to alterations in fiber bundles than voxelbased methods. We also found that mean values of right CST were both significantly negatively correlated with MOCA, HVLT-R (IR and RET), and SDMT, which suggested that higher FD corresponds to a significant decrease in cognitive function, attentional function, and verbal memory.\nOur findings show consistent changes in the WM pathways across four cognitive stages in PD. FD shows a decrease in left CB, FDC shows a decrease in the body of CC, and FD shows an increase in right CST, this trend of WM alteration is consistent with the severity of symptoms. Although there was a consistent trend among four groups, the WM status of patients in the states of PD-NC, PD-CC, and PD-MCI was very similar, especially in the states of PD-CC and PD-MCI. Therefore, treating patients with PD with cognitive impairment may make timely diagnosis and treatment to delay cognitive decline by regularly examining the WM changes in the mentioned areas.\nWe also discovered the continuous changes of two unilateral fiber, previous studies showed PD usually presents with unilateral motor symptoms that eventually spread to the other side 33, and this laterality is also reflected in cognitive function 34. In current work, FD of CB decreased in left brain. Previous studies have shown that PD patients with left-onset made significantly more errors in study acquisition than those with right-onset and normal control 35. Combined with the significant correlation between FD of left CB and cognitive function found in the current work, we hypothesize that the reduction of left CB may be an important incentive to cognitive decline in PD, and may spread to the whole brain. There is also an increase in FD of right CST, this phenomenon may be interpreted as compensation. CST compensation has been verified in adult mice 36, but has not been reported in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction, the detailed mechanism underlying this association needs further follow-up investigation.\nOur study has few limitations. First, comparing with adult HARDI data (typical b-value of 3,000 smm 2 ), our data quality whose analysis employed clinical single-shell DTI protocols at 3 T (64 gradient directions, b  1,000 smm 2 ) is relatively low. To verify our findings in the future, we recommend data with higher b values. Second, the present work did not consider the effects of WM hyper-intensity (WMH) on experiments, a previous study showed significant area may become much more spatially localized when WMH loads 7, future work will further investigate the relationship between WMH and cognitive decline in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage from normal aging to dementia, characterized by noticeable changes in cognitive function that do not significantly impact daily life. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) plays a crucial role in understanding MCI by assessing white matter integrity and revealing early signs of axonal degeneration and myelin breakdown before cognitive symptoms appear. Methods: This study utilized the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to compare white matter microstructure in individuals with MCI to cognitively normal (CN) individuals, employing advanced dMRI techniques such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI), and free water imaging (FWI). Results: Analyzing data from 55 CN subjects and 46 individuals with MCI, this study found significant differences in white matter integrity, particularly in free water levels and kurtosis values, suggesting neuroinflammatory responses and microstructural integrity disruption in MCI. Moreover, negative correlations between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and free water levels in the brain within the MCI group point to the potential of these measures as early biomarkers for cognitive impairment. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates how a multimodal advanced diffusion imaging approach can uncover early microstructural changes in MCI, offering insights into the neurobiological mechanisms behind cognitive decline.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by changes in cognitive abilities that exceed what might be expected from normal cognitive aging but do not significantly interfere with daily activities (Anand and Schoo, 2024). Factors such as genetics, diabetes, depression, stroke, and other medical conditions can contribute to the development of MCI (Roberts and Knopman, 2013). Neuropathological changes due to Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, including amyloidbeta plaques, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration, may also contribute to the development of MCI. While MCI is a risk factor for dementia, not all individuals with MCI progress to dementia; some remain stable, and others may even revert to normal cognitive function.\nSeveral neuroimaging techniques have emerged as valuable tools for investigating the neuropathological changes associated with MCI in recent years (Yanhong et al., 2013;Yin et al., 2013). Among these techniques, diffusion MRI (dMRI) is used to study the microstructural alterations in brain tissue. By measuring the diffusion of water molecules in the brain, dMRI provides insights into the integrity of white matter tracts and the organization of neuronal connections (Le Bihan, 2014;Mueller et al., 2015), which is often compromised in individuals with MCI. Disruptions in white matter microstructure, such as axonal degeneration and myelin breakdown, can precede the onset of cognitive symptoms and serve as early biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes (Power et al., 2019). Additionally, dMRI allows for the investigation of structural connectivity networks in the brain (Zhang et al., 2022), shedding light on the degeneration of functional pathways associated with cognitive decline in MCI.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique widely employed in dMRI studies, owing to its proficiency in assessing white matter microstructure and inferring fiber tractography. DTI metrics like fractional anisotropy (FA) and tractography (Tae et al., 2018) enable the identification of network topology changes and specific brain regions particularly vulnerable to degeneration. However, DTI-derived metrics may provide ambiguous or misleading data in areas with crossing fibers or complex tissue microenvironments, thus hindering the accurate assessment of white matter integrity (Coutu et al., 2014). Advanced dMRI methods, such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) (Jensen et al., 2005;Jensen and Helpern, 2010;Falangola et al., 2013) and free-water imaging (FWI) (Pasternak et al., 2009), have emerged as robust alternatives to conventional DTI. These approaches address the limitations of DTI by modeling non-Gaussian diffusion processes associated with intricate fiber geometries and accommodating various tissue compartments (Jensen et al., 2005;Jensen and Helpern, 2010;Steven et al., 2014), such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular free water (Pierpaoli et al., 1996).\nDKI captures the complex diffusion patterns exhibited by biological tissues more accurately than DTI by incorporating higherorder diffusion moments, such as kurtosis, which provides insights into tissue microstructural complexity (Jensen et al., 2005;Jensen and Helpern, 2010). Lower diffusion kurtosis values indicate less constrained diffusion, which may correlate with neuronal loss or other pathological alterations (Arab et al., 2018). FWI accounts for the influence of free water contamination by estimating the volume fraction of extracellular free water (f) within brain tissue. FWI enables the derivation of DTI metrics corrected for this confounding factor, thus enhancing the specificity of white matter assessments (Pasternak et al., 2009;Bergamino et al., 2017Bergamino et al., , 2021)). DKI and FWI have been used in studies investigating MCI and dementia, yielding significant findings that contribute to the understanding of these conditions (Dumont et al., 2019;Bergamino et al., 2021Bergamino et al., , 2024;;Chu et al., 2022).\nIn addition to diffusion changes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly observed on MRI scans of elderly individuals and are biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease (Kynast et al., 2018). WMH can disrupt white matter tracts, leading to impaired communication between brain regions (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2023). Previous studies have found that higher WMH volume increases the risk of developing MCI and dementia, indicating that WMH may serve as a biomarker for cognitive decline (Debette and Markus, 2010). For these reasons, WMHs were included as a covariate to help control for its confounding effects, isolating the impact between white matter tracts and cognitive decline in MCI.\nThis study assessed white matter microstructural differences between a cohort of individuals with MCI and an age-matched group of cognitively normal individuals (CN), utilizing data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (Petersen et al., 2010). 1 This study utilized three distinct dMRI techniques-free-water DTI, kurtosis imaging, and mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI)-to investigate MCI. To our knowledge, no prior study has integrated both free-water DTI and kurtosis imaging in MCI research, nor has the MSDKI model been applied in this context. This multi-modal approach enables a comprehensive analysis of white matter microstructural alterations, offering insights that single-technique studies may overlook. Addressing the extracellular free-water component and capturing non-Gaussian diffusion behavior will achieve a more precise characterization of the tissue microstructure heterogeneity associated with MCI. Moreover, voxel-based correlations between the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2015) and diffusion metrics were assessed within the MCI group.",

Inclusion criteria included the designation of CN or MCI and the availability of anatomical and multi-shell dMRI data. Subjects missing the magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) or T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) images were excluded. Fifty-five CN subjects (39 females; age (standard deviation, SD)  76.1 (7.0) years) and 46 MCI individuals (16 females age  74.2 (7.6) years) were included in this study.\nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were available for all 55 CN individuals and 45 subjects with MCI. The primary function of the MMSE is to assess cognitive abilities such as orientation, memory, attention, language skills, and visuospatial abilities. Scoring on the MMSE ranges from 0 to 30 points, with a score of 25 or higher considered normal. Scores below 24 may indicate possible cognitive impairment (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2015). Additional cognitive assessments administered to both groups and available in the ADNI dataset included the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a screening tool to evaluate depressive symptoms in older adults (Yesavage et al., 1982); the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), designed to assess instrumental activities of daily living, particularly in older adults with cognitive impairment (Marshall et al., 2015); and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), a tool used to stage dementia severity and track changes in cognitive function longitudinally (Morris, 1993).\nApolipoprotein E (ApoE) status is a genetic risk factor implicated in AD risk. Patients with the e4 allele show a higher risk of developing MCI and AD, with the additive risk associated with homozygous e4e4 alleles (Liu et al., 2013). On the other hand, the e2 allele is protective for AD risk. ApoE status and complete demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1.",

Using kurtosis metrics, DKI quantifies the degree of deviation from a Gaussian distribution, an assumption of standard DTI. This model can offer insights into the microstructural complexity of tissues beyond what DTI can provide through the kurtosis coefficient (K), which reflects the deviation from Gaussian diffusion. This study utilized two DKI metrics: the mean kurtosis tensor (MKT) and the kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), which depend solely on the kurtosis tensor. Additionally, standard DKI metrics, including mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (RK), and axial kurtosis (AK), were analyzed.

    "Mean signal diffusion kurtosis imaging (MSDKI)": {
      "text": "An essential limitation of DKI is that its measurements are susceptible to noise and image artifacts. For instance, due to low radial diffusivity, standard kurtosis estimates in regions with well-aligned voxels may be corrupted by implausibly low or negative values. To overcome this issue, the MSDKI model can be used (Henriques et al., 2021). This model simplifies the DKI approach by averaging the signal intensities over all diffusion directions for each b-value before calculating the kurtosis. The averaging process reduces the influence of directional variability in water diffusion, yielding a scalar metric that reflects the average diffusion kurtosis across all directions. The mean signal approach aims to simplify the complexity and computational demand of DKI. In this study, the mean signal diffusion (MSD) and the mean signal kurtosis (MSK) metrics were computed using DIPYs MeanDiffusionKurtosisModel class and the msdki_model.fit function via an in-house Python script. The MSD metric represents the average diffusion coefficient across all directions within a voxel. It provides insights into the microstructural environment of tissues, particularly in areas with complex architecture. A lower MSD value may indicate denser or more restricted tissue environments, while higher values suggest more free water movement, potentially reflecting damaged tissue. The MSK is a metric that quantitatively describes the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue, averaged over all diffusion directions. MSK provides a scalar value reflecting the average excess kurtosis of water diffusion, indicating the complexity and heterogeneity of tissue microstructure without emphasizing diffusion directionality.",

The voxel-based analysis (between groups and correlations with MMSE) was restricted to voxels within the combined masks derived from the ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas and the JHU white-matter tractography atlas. Clusters showing statistically significant differences across groups were annotated according to the JHU DTI-based white-matter atlases (Wakana et al., 2007;Hua et al., 2008).\nA Students t-test with a linear model function was employed to assess voxel-based differences across groups in all diffusion-related metrics.

      "text": "This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between diffusion metrics and cognitive status in CN and MCI cohorts. Through a multi-modal approach encompassing FWI, DKI, and MSDKI, this research offers valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning cognitive decline.\nOur primary objective was to explore the complementary insights offered by FW-DTI and kurtosis MRI. Prior research has neither applied FW-DTI and DKI imaging to MCI, nor utilized MSDKI in this context. This multi-modal approach offers a comprehensive analysis of white matter alterations, providing insights that single-technique studies may overlook. Addressing the extracellular free-water component and capturing non-Gaussian diffusion behavior can lead to a precise characterization of tissue microstructure heterogeneity in MCI. The methodology is strengthened by the use of multi-shell data for free-water imaging. Multi-shell data allows for accurate separation of the free-water and tissue compartments, leading to reliable microstructural measurements. In contrast, single-shell approaches can result in biased estimates due to their limitations in disentangling these components. As noted by Golub et al., multiple b-values enhance the robustness and accuracy of FWI-DTI model (Golub et al., 2021).\nFW-DTI accounts for the extracellular free-water component, providing more accurate tissue microstructure metrics, while kurtosis A multi-shell dMRI acquisition computed the FWI-related metric, employing the algorithm developed by Hoy et al. (2014). This approach surpasses the constraints associated with single-shell acquisition algorithms (Pasternak et al., 2009). In analyzing the f index metric related to the free water content within brain tissue, pronounced differences between the CN and MCI groups were observed. Specifically, individuals with MCI demonstrated elevated free water levels across several white matter regions, potentially indicative of neuroinflammatory responses or axonal degradation processes (Dumont et al., 2019;Nakaya et al., 2022). These findings match those of prior studies showing higher free water measures in MCI and AD patients compared to CN controls (Dumont et al., 2019;Bergamino et al., 2021). Additionally, the identification of extensive clusters with large effect sizes, particularly in the corpus callosum, right cerebral peduncle, right sagittal stratum, and right uncinate fasciculus, highlights the vulnerability of these areas in the MCI cohort and suggests potential pathways for the spread of pathological changes.\nAnalysis of fw-FA metrics revealed a distinct pattern of white matter integrity degradation in the MCI group. Compared to the CN cohort, MCI subjects exhibited significantly lower fw-FA values in regions critical for cognitive processing and memory, including the right sagittal stratum, left cingulum (hippocampus), and right fornix (crus)stria terminalis. Extensive clusters with a coefficient g  0.61 in these areas point to compromised axonal integrity and myelination, likely reflecting early neurodegenerative changes. White matter clusters with elevated fw-FA values were also identified within the MCI group. These clusters had a large effect size, but their volumes were notably small.\nThe DKI model can overcome some of the limitations of DTI and has shown promise in differentiating between individuals with AD, MCI, and cognitively normal individuals (Struyfs et al., 2015;Chu , 2022;Xu et al., 2023). The lower kurtosis values across several white matter regions in the MCI group suggest a potential disruption in the microstructural integrity of these areas compared to the CN group. These significant differences, characterized by large clusters and large effect sizes, underscore the sensitivity of DKI-related metrics in detecting subtle variations in white matter microstructure. These findings align with previous research that demonstrated the utility of DKI in identifying microstructural changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Struyfs et al., 2015). In this study, the white matter regions most associated with cognitive decline are the superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, and sagittal stratum. Smaller clusters with higher kurtosis values in the MCI group introduce an intriguing aspect of white matter pathology in MCI. This finding might suggest a heterogeneous response of white matter to the disease process, with specific areas possibly Only significant clusters with large effect size (g  0.61) are presented. Comprehensive results, including medium and lower effect sizes, can be found in Supplementary Tables S8,S9. Vol (): Percentage of the clusters volume within the respective white matter area, t: Mean t value within the cluster; gmax: Maximum g value within the cluster.\nreflecting processes such as astrogliosis and macrophage aggregation. These findings indicate that elevated kurtosis may be associated with early or specific pathological changes, rather than simply indicating a general decline in tissue integrity (Guan et al., 2021). This study employed a novel approach utilizing the MSDKI model to investigate MCI and dementia. The findings provide evidence regarding the utility of MSD and MSK metrics in distinguishing between MCI and CN groups. The voxel-based statistical analysis revealed significant differences between MCI and CN groups, with MCI participants showing higher levels of water diffusion (MSD) and lower MSK values than the CN group. These differences were particularly pronounced in the white matter regions where clusters exhibited large effect sizes.\nThe increased free water diffusion observed in the MCI group may reflect microstructural degradation within white matter Voxel-based correlations between all diffusion metrics ((A) f index, (B) fw-FA, (C) MKT, (D) KFA, (E) MK, (F) AK, (G) RK, (H) MSD, and (I) MSK) and MMSE scores were computed using a linear model (at FDR  0.05). Large clusters of correlations were found particularly for the f-index and MSD metrics. The parameters reported include t-values (t) and Spearmans correlation coefficients (ρ). pathways. This degradation is likely a result of neurodegenerative processes that compromise the integrity of white matter, facilitating greater water movement. The alignment of MSD findings with the f index further corroborates this interpretation, suggesting a consistent pattern of white matter compromise by higher free water levels in individuals with MCI.\nConversely, the lower MSK values observed in the MCI group might indicate a reduction in the complexity of the microstructural environment. Kurtosis measures the deviation of water diffusion from a Gaussian distribution, with lower values suggesting a more homogeneous diffusion environment. This might be interpreted as a loss of microstructural complexity, potentially due to the simplification of neural pathways or a decrease in neuronal density, which are hallmark features of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration (Chu et al., 2022).\nAs assessed by MMSE scores, the voxel-based correlations in Figure 4 highlight the relationship between diffusion metrics and cognitive function. Significant negative correlations between MMSE scores and both the f index and the MSD metric across several white matter regions underscore the potential of these diffusion metrics as biomarkers for cognitive impairment. These correlations suggest that as the integrity of white matter decreases, cognitive function, measured by the MMSE, diminishes. This is consistent with previous research indicating that white matter integrity is crucial for efficient cognitive functioning, and white matter degradation can be linked to various neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline (Madden et al., 2009;Chen et al., 2023).\nThe analysis also revealed both positive and negative correlations between MMSE scores and other diffusion metrics across different brain regions. This indicates that certain brain regions may compensate for white matter degradation in others, or that changes in brain structure differentially impact different aspects of cognitive function.\nTogether, these findings revealed differences between groups across several white matter regions, including the forceps minor, inferiorsuperior longitudinal fasciculus, and corpus callosum. These areas are potentially associated with MCI or dementia. Therefore, studying the relationship between MCI and white matter microstructure using different dMRI methods may enhance our understanding and yield more comprehensive results. Although this study cannot definitively determine which metric or region is most sensitive to the earliest microstructural changes, the multi-modal approach aims to provide a comprehensive view of white matter alterations in MCI. We hypothesize that combining these metrics will While this study employed multi-shell dMRI data and advanced dMRI models to address certain shortcomings of standard DTI, it remains subject to other limitations. Although DKI metrics have been reported to be less affected by the partial volume effect (PVE) than DTI metrics (Yang et al., 2013), they might still be influenced by PVEs. Another limitation is related to the MSDKI model, a variation of DKI that simplifies the complex metrics of DKI into a single mean signal metric. By focusing on a mean signal approach, MSDKI might overlook specific microstructural complexities that can be captured through the full DKI model. This simplification may lead to a loss of valuable information about the directionality of diffusion and microstructural heterogeneity within tissues.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the complex link between diffusion metrics and cognitive status in cohorts of CN and MCI participants. It supplements previous research by revealing that microstructural changes, which are detectable through advanced diffusion imaging, may serve as early indicators of cognitive impairment. Additionally, multimodal diffusion MRI techniques provide new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive decline while underscoring the value of advanced imaging for early detection.",

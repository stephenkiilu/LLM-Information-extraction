    "abstract": "We assessed white matter (WM) integrity in MAPT mutation carriers (16 asymptomatic, 5 symptomatic) compared to 31 non-carrier family controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (fractional anisotropy; FA, mean diffusivity; MD) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) (neurite density index; NDI, orientation and dispersion index; ODI). Linear mixed-effects models accounting for age and family relatedness revealed alterations across DTI and NODDI metrics in all mutation carriers and in symptomatic carriers, with the most significant differences involving fronto-temporal WM tracts. Asymptomatic carriers showed higher entorhinal MD and lower cingulum FA and patterns of higher ODI mostly involving temporal areas and long association and projections fibers. Regression models between estimated time to or time from disease and DTI and NODDI metrics in key regions (amygdala, cingulum, entorhinal, inferior temporal, uncinate fasciculus) in all carriers showed increasing abnormalities with estimated time to or time from disease onset, with FA and NDI showing the strongest relationships. Neuritebased metrics, particularly ODI, appear to be particularly sensitive to early WM involvement in asymptomatic carriers.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Mutations on the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause around 5 to 20 of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (f-FTLD) (Moore et al., 2020;Ramos et al., 2020;Sieben et al., 2012). These mutations are most often associated with early-onset clinical syndromes predominantly involving behavior and personality, in addition to other syndromes primarily targeting memory, language, andor motor functions, although to a lesser prevalence (Boeve et al., 2022). Several efforts have been undertaken to characterize brain abnormalities in MAPT mutation carriers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andor diffusion MRI (dMRI) (Chen  Kantarci, 2020;Peet et al., 2021). One consistent finding is the selective atrophy of gray matter in the medial temporal lobe (Cash et al., 2018;Chu et al., 2021;Fumagalli et al., 2018;Staffaroni et al., 2022) and the degeneration of regional frontotemporal white matter (WM) tracts and long association and projection fibers connecting these primarily affected areas to the rest of the brain (Chen et al., 2019;Chu et al., 2021). Importantly, a growing number of investigations have found that WM abnormalities are observable in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers compared to family non-carriers several years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (Chen et al., 2019;Dopper et al., 2014;Jiskoot et al., 2018). These abnormalities mostly involve changes in mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in tracts known to be implicated in MAPT mutations, notably the uncinate fasciculus (Chen et al., 2019;Dopper et al., 2014;Jiskoot et al., 2018) and the cingulum (Jiskoot et al., 2018). Moreover, one longitudinal study from our group has shown an increase of entorhinal MD in asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers, and these changes correlated with estimated time to symptom onset (Chen et al., 2019). These findings position WM alterations as an important candidate to shed light on the earliest pathognomonic processes associated with MAPT mutations and estimate where an individual stands along the pathobiological spectrum of the disease.\nRecent technological advances in the area of dMRI have made Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) (Edwards et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2012) feasible for multi-site study with cognitively impaired participants. NODDI is a multi-shell model that can measure biological properties related to WM integrity. It is divided into three properties: Neurite Density Index (NDI), which represents the fraction of restricted (tissue) water contained within neurites (thin pipes, i.e., axons), the volume fraction of unrestricted (and as a consequence, isotropically diffusing) with free water (isotropic value fraction or ISOVF), and Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), which represents the extent to which the neurite directions are dispersed. NODDI measures differ from traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) products (FA and MD) in that by explicitly modeling the intra-axonal (neurite), extracellular (but within tissue) and CSF components, they separate effects such as axonal degeneration, changes in axonal arrangement (dispersion), and overall atrophy (encroachment by CSF). In contrast, MD and FA look at the overall diffusivity and anisotropy of the whole voxel without discerning the fractions of different water environments inside the voxel (Soares et al., 2013;Thomason  Thompson, 2011). Thus, NODDI is meant to offer results that are interpretable in terms of biophysical parameters of brain tissue. While NODDI has not been extensively applied as DTI in neurodegenerative diseases, recent evidence has shown that NODDI metrics provide greater sensitivity than FA and MD to tau pathology in mice models of Alzheimers disease (Colgan et al., 2016) and to WM alterations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Barritt et al., 2018), and could identify patterns of imaging abnormalities specific to cerebrovascular disease, tauopathies and TDP-43 pathology in humans (Raghavan et al., 2022). Therefore, NODDI may have the potential to capture the earliest WM changes associated with neurodegenerative processes, although it has not been applied in f-FTLD and more specifically in MAPT mutation carriers. This endeavor is particularly important given the rarity of MAPT mutation carriers in the general population, which underscores the need for sensitive biomarkers to enrich clinical trials.\nWe aimed to assess axonal integrity in MAPT mutation carriers and early WM neurodegeneration in asymptomatic carriers using traditional DTI (FA and MD) and NODDI measurements (NDI and ODI). To this end, we obtained data from asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers and family non-carriers with available multishell dMRI from the ARTFLLEFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) cohort. We first compared DTI and NODDI metrics between MAPT carriers and family non-carriers across a wide set of regions of interest (ROIs) to determine which areas best discriminate these groups. This was done in all MAPT carriers versus family controls, and then in asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT carriers versus controls. We then performed a secondary analysis with DTI and NODDI values in a few key brain regions identified based on the initial analysis on group differences and determined associations between these metrics and actual time of (for symptomatic carriers) or estimated time to (for asymptomatic carriers) symptom onset in all MAPT mutation carriers.",

    "Participants": {
      "text": "In the context of this study, we included demographic, clinical, and genetic results from participants with a confirmed MAPT genetic mutation and non-carrier first-degree relatives who had available multi-shell dMRI data from the ALLFTD cohort from June 2020 to November 2021. This resulted in 52 participants from 4 ALLFTD sites, of which 21 carried a MAPT mutation and 31 were non-carrier relatives which were included as controls. Among MAPT mutation carriers, 5 were in the symptomatic phase of the disease (see details below) and 16 were asymptomatic. Scanning sites included were MGHHarvard (n  6, 12), Washington University (St. Louis) (n  2, 4), Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (n  7, 13) and Mayo Clinic Rochester (n  37, 71).\nClinical diagnoses were attributed by clinicians experienced in FTD and were based on medical history review, mental status examination, and a neurological examination. Mental status examination was done using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005) and the Clinical Dementia Staging Instrument plus NACC FTLD Behavior and Language Domains sum of boxes (CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB) (Knopman et al., 2008). Of the five symptomatic carriers, three were diagnosed with bvFTD (Rascovsky et al., 2011), one had mild behavioral andor cognitive impairment (MBCI) (Barker et al., 2022) and one was diagnosed with an Alzheimers disease-like amnestic syndrome (McKhann et al., 2011).\nInclusion criteria for this specific study were: 1) being a member of a family with a known MAPT mutation and at an age of 18 years or older; 2) the predominant phenotype in the kindred should be in either the behavioralcognitive domain and not motor (i.e., parkinsonism or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), 3) presence of a reliable informant who is in contact with the participant on a weekly basis, 4) being sufficiently fluent in English to complete all measures, 5) being willing and able to consent to the protocol and undergo yearly assessments, 6) being willing to undergo neuropsychological assessments, and 7) not having contraindications for MRI examination. Exclusion criteria were: 1) absence of a known MAPT mutation in the participant or the family, 2) presence of a structural brain lesion (e.g., tumor, stroke), and 3) presence of a neurological condition that could alter findings (e.g., clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis).",

    "Image acquisition and processing": {
      "text": "The MRI sequences used in this analysis included T 1 -weighted and multi-shell diffusion weighted scans. They were performed on four 3T Siemens Prisma scanners (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at four different sites. The T 1 -weighted scans used a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with repetition time 2300ms, echo time 3.14ms, and inversion time 945ms, flip angle 9, and 1.0mm isotropic resolution. The diffusion weighted images were acquired with a spin echo single shot Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence with 2.0mm isotropic voxels. The echo times varied with scanner model from 62 to 93ms, with the majority having 71ms. Each scan had 13 b  0, 6 b  500, 48 b  1000, and 60 b  2000 smm 2 volumes, with the diffusion gradients in each shell evenly spread using an electrostatic repulsion scheme (Caruyer et al., 2013), modified to distribute them over whole spheres instead of hemispheres.\nAfter denoising (Veraart et al., 2016) the diffusion weighed images, head motion and eddy current distortion were corrected using FSLs eddy program (Andersson et al., 2016(Andersson et al., , 2017;;Andersson  Sotiropoulos, 2016). We corrected for Gibbs ringing (Kellner et al., 2016) and then skull stripped the images (Reid et al., 2018). The Rician noise bias was then removed (Koay et al., 2009). The reason we run unring after eddy is that although most of the ringing is intrinsic to the acquisition, some is also added by eddy when it interpolates the image because of fractional voxel motions and eddy current distortions. It uses a higher order (than linear) interpolation, which achieves less blurring at the cost of some ringing. Running unring after eddy is done to correct ringing from both the acquisition and eddy. Diffusion tensors were estimated using nonlinear least squares fitting and used to calculate FA and MD images (Garyfallidis et al., 2014). ANTS (Avants et al., 2014) was used to nonlinearly register a modified version of the JHU Eve WM atlas (Oishi et al., 2009) to each subjects FA image. Voxels with MD  2  10 -3 or  7  10 -5 mm 2 s were excluded as mostly CSF or air, respectively, and the median FA and MD were calculated in each ROI. The cuneus, precuneus, fusiform, and lingual WM regions were excluded since they were too small for reliable registration. Although echo-planar imaging distortion was not explicitly corrected for, it was implicitly corrected for since the findings were from nonlinearly warping the JHU Eve FA image to each subjects FA image. The atlas registrations were then inspected for quality control by an image analyst (RR).\nFor each region (except the pons, medulla, and midbrain, for susceptibility and coverage issues), we then estimated the DTI and NODDI values as the median of the voxel values within the ROI. The median was used to minimize any possible influence from artifacts or partial volume contamination at ROI boundaries. We also converted NDI, the fraction of tissue that is neurites, into tissue-weighted NDI, a quantity proportional to the total number of neurites in each voxel, as tNDI  NDI  (1 -ISOVF). All DTI and NODDI metrics were combined across hemispheres. This was done because it is well established that patterns of brain abnormalities in MAPT mutation carriers show symmetrical patterns across hemispheres (Fumagalli et al., 2018;Rohrer et al., 2010;Whitwell et al., 2009).",

    "Statistical analyses": {
      "text": "Demographic and clinical data were compared between asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers, symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers and family controls using generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. These models were adjusted for age and accounted for the family structure using random effects. Tukey contrasts were subsequently used for pair-wise comparisons when the omnibus test was significant.\nWeighted median values for FA, MD, tNDI and ODI for each region of the JHU atlas were log-transformed. Between-site data were harmonized using ComBat, a batch-effect correction tool which has been shown to preserve biological variability due to covariates of interest (i.e., age and diagnosis) while removing unwanted variation introduced by site in dMRI data (Fortin et al., 2017). Mixed effect linear models were used to assess WM alterations in MAPT mutation carriers. This type of model is an extension of simple linear models that allows to account for non-independence in the data. This is particularly relevant to this study given that a substantial proportion of MAPT mutation carriers were recruited along with non-carriers from the same family. Separate models were fit across all regions for each measure (FA, MD, tNDI, ODI) in all MAPT mutation carriers versus controls, then in asymptomatic and symptomatic MAPT mutation carriers versus controls. Age was centered at 45 (mean age of all participants). Family relatedness was included in each mixed model as a random family-specific intercept effect. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was applied across all ROIs, and within each dMRI measure.\nWe then performed a follow-up analysis to determine which dMRI metric was able to best distinguish between all MAPT mutation carriers versus non-carriers based on group-wise comparisons results. We combined the median values of each significant ROI per metric into a meta-ROI weighted for the number of voxels in each ROI, thus resulting in four meta-ROIs (FA, MD, tNDI and ODI) for each patient. We then used mixed effect linear models as described above to compare all MAPT mutation carriers versus non-carriers on these meta-ROIs and compared models by assessing the overlap in estimate confidence intervals (CIs).\nWe conducted secondary analyses to assess the association of estimated time until (for asymptomatic carriers) or time since (for symptomatic carriers) disease onset and DTI and NODDI metrics in a set of key ROIs which were determined based on the results of groupwise comparisons described above. Given that time to symptom onset was not available in asymptomatic carriers, we calculated the estimated time to symptom onset according to the age at symptom onset in the symptomatic carrier from the kindred. It is thus possible that some asymptomatic carriers may be past their estimated age at symptom onset, due to the variability across MAPT mutations and even within families with the same MAPT mutation in terms of age at symptom onset (Domoto-Reilly et al., 2017;Manoochehri et al., 2023). We then fit linear regression models between each log-transformed DTI and NODDI metric and actualestimated time to symptom onset across all MAPT mutation carriers. We conducted sensitivity analyses using Cooks distance to assess whether significant change in slopes could be caused by influential observations, where an observation with a value greater than 0.5 was considered influential.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We used traditional DTI and recently developed NODDI metrics to assess WM integrity in MAPT mutation carriers and early axonal abnormalities in asymptomatic carriers. Models in all MAPT mutation carriers revealed overlapping patterns across different dMRI metrics mostly involving regional frontotemporal areas and projecting tracts and long associations fibers connecting these areas to the rest of the brain. Similar widespread WM abnormality patterns were found in symptomatic carriers. In symptomatic carriers, however, traditional DTI metrics revealed patterns of WM alterations restricted to the medial temporal lobe, whereas widespread patterns of increased axonal dispersion (i.e., ODI) were observed. Additionally, a follow-up, exploratory analysis showed that the combination of differences observed for tNDI outperformed FA in distinguishing MAPT carriers from controls. Our results suggest that DTI and NODDI measurements may have different sensitivities to WM alterations in MAPT mutation carriers. Importantly, measurements that separated axon-type water from other compartments, particularly ODI, were sensitive to early WM abnormalities during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. In a secondary analysis, we demonstrated that dMRI measures, especially FA and tNDI, track with disease progression in time and therefore may potentially be used in predicting time to phenoconversion. dMRI studies that have examined tau-mediated WM injury have generally reported reduced FA and increased MD in areas known to be vulnerable to large-scale degeneration in MAPT mutation carriers, including frontotemporal areas and structurally connected tracts such as the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum (Chen  Kantarci, 2020;Jiskoot et al., 2018Jiskoot et al., , 2019;;Panman et al., 2019). Thus, our findings with FA and MD are in agreement with previous studies. It is also worth noting that higher MD was found in the entorhinal WM only in asymptomatic carriers, and that this metric also tracked with actual or estimated age at symptom onset across all MAPT carriers. This is highly consistent with findings from Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2019), where longitudinal increase in entorhinal MD was also found to distinguish asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers from family controls and to track with estimated disease progression. However, this study failed to find significant differences in FA values in asymptomatic carriers, whereas we found lower FA in the cingulum and inferior temporal WM. This may be due to the inclusion of a larger number of asymptomatic carriers in our study. Overall, our results in FA and MD appear to faithfully replicate previous findings, further consolidating the reliability of traditional DTI to measure WM abnormalities in MAPT carriers.\nThe novel aspect of this study is the inclusion of NODDI to assess WM abnormalities in MAPT mutation carriers. We found topologically overlapping patterns of WM alterations across DTI and NODDI metrics in all MAPT mutation carriers, where regions showing the most robust statistical differences again involved frontotemporal areas and associated tracts. This suggests that both traditional DTI and NODDI measure similar disease-related processes involved in the disruption of WM integrity. One crucial finding is the observation of widespread ODI patterns in asymptomatic carriers involving temporal and occipital WM as well as the superior and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the cingulum, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. In contrast, FA and MD revealed patterns of abnormalities restricted to temporal areas. This suggests that DTI and NODDI may have different sensitivities to WM abnormalities at different stages of the disease, and that ODI may be more sensitive than traditional DTI metrics to early WM changes in FTLD. This would be in line with a handful of studies that have suggested biologically meaningful relationships between NODDI and measures of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, two studies have found better sensitivity of ODI compared to FA and MD to histological measures of orientation dispersion in the spinal cord in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (Grussu et al., 2015(Grussu et al., , 2017)), and another recent study observed strong associations between NODDI metrics and in vivo imaging proxies and post-mortem measurements of tau and TDP-43 pathologies (Raghavan et al., 2022). While these studies did not specifically focus on asymptomatic carriers, they suggest that NODDI may have high sensitivity to biological disease-related changes in FTLDs.\nAnother finding worth discussing is the discrepancy between tNDI and ODI findings in asymptomatic MAPT carriers, where widespread differences in ODI values were observed while lower tNDI values were only found in the amygdala. While the interpretation of this result remains highly speculative given the scarcity of published data on this topic, it is possible that ODI abnormalities reflect biological processes occurring in the earlier phase of the disease such as neuroinflammation (Sone et al., 2020) or dendritic arborization modifications (e.g., loosening or loss of complexity) as supported by findings in human (Broad et al., 2019) and animal models in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Fogarty et al., 2016;Jara et al., 2012). On the other hand, NDI may reflect neuronal and neurite loss, which typically occurs later in the disease course (Broad et al., 2019;Raghavan et al., 2021) (Broad et al., 2019;Raghavan et al., 2021). Thus, the finding of lower tNDI in the amygdala may be explained early focal tau-related degeneration as supported by findings in animals (Cook et al., 2014) and human (Bocchetta et al., 2019), while widespread ODI abnormalities may reflect other biological processes such as those mentioned above. Additional support for this hypothesis is the finding of a better discriminative values of the tNDI meta-ROI compared to FA in distinguishing MAPT carriers (while including symptomatic carriers) from controls.\nThese groups comparisons contrast with the finding of significant correlations between tNDI values and estimated disease progression across all ROIs, while only the model in the cingulum was significant for ODI. This would be in line with the hypothesis above stating that increased axonal dispersion may be an early feature in the disease process, while neurite density may decrease more progressively throughout the disease course, although this statement is pending replication in future studies designed to address this question.\nWhile this study represents an early step in using NODDI to characterize WM alterations in MAPT mutation carriers, and especially in asymptomatic carriers, our results are promising and have implications for therapeutic endeavors. One recent large-scale study by Staffaroni et al. (Staffaroni et al., 2022) used disease progression models to identify neuroimaging markers deemed most useful to design endpoints in clinical trials in f-FTLD. However, this study did not include dMRI measurements. The fact that both DTI and NODDI metrics, especially FA and tNDI, tracked with estimated disease progression and that ODI appears to be a sensitive marker of early WM changes in MAPT mutation carriers argues for the inclusion of such measures in global initiatives aimed at the prevention and treatment of FTLD. The inclusion of such metrics in the development of disease progression models could facilitate the planning of clinical trials by optimizing enrollment, tailoring desired endpoints, and reducing the number of patients required to detected therapy-induced effects. This is crucial given that treatments are most likely to be successful if initiated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (Boeve et al., 2022) and the rarity of f-FTLD, which is a major obstacle for enrollment purposes.\nOur findings must be interpreted in the light of some limitations. While our sample was deeply phenotyped and was scanned using an advanced dMRI protocol that was not available in all of the ALLFTD Consortium sites, it was relatively small. This is particularly true for symptomatic carriers group, which was only composed of five patients. Thus, although the statistical effects in this group behaved in the expected direction, caution is warranted in the interpretation of these results which are pending replication in larger cohorts. While we used the Combat algorithm to harmonize multi-site data, this algorithm has not been tested in small datasets such as in this study. It is thus difficult to gauge the extent of inter-individual variability that is attributable to this factor. However, it is of note that ComBat derives its corrections using all the participants at each site, and it thus not directly affected by the number of carriers. The design of this study was cross-sectional. These limitations prevented us from assessing more complex and longitudinal relationships between dMRI metrics and disease progression. For instance, the relationships between MD, tNDI (amygdala) and ODI (cingulum) and estimated disease progression, although significant, were seemingly driven by symptomatic carriers. However, the sample size limitation did not allow us to assess slope change as a function of clinical status. This also speaks to the low prevalence of MAPT mutation carriers in the general population (Moore et al., 2020). It is also important to note that estimated age to symptom onset is an inherently imperfect measure of disease progression. Indeed, there exists high between-and withinfamily variability across and even within FTLD-related genetic mutations (Domoto-Reilly et al., 2017;Manoochehri et al., 2023), which may be due to factors such as cognitive reserve (Premi et al., 2013(Premi et al., , 2017) ) or incomplete penetrance in some families with MAPT mutations (Anfossi et al., 2011;Munoz et al., 2007;Van Herpen et al., 2003). Another aspect is the limited availability of NODDI, which is an emerging imaging technique that is solely used in research context at the moment. Tt is noteworthy that group differences between asymptomatic carriers and controls, albeit significant, did not survive after correcting for multiple comparisons. Many factors may be at fault for this, including the small sample size or the inclusion of controls who were, on average, older than asymptomatic carriers. While we used age as a covariate in our models to mitigate this concern, the inclusion of controls comparable in terms of age would have been optimal. Therefore, one must remain cautious in interpreting these findings. Finally, a methodological limitation pertains to the susceptibility distortion caused by signal pileup in the temporal horns, which could not be corrected. This may have limited the accuracy and localization of those regions during image processing.\nIn conclusion, our results indicate that traditional DTI and NODDI measurements may offer different sensitivities across clinical stages in MAPT mutation carriers, and that ODI may be particularly sensitive to early WM degeneration in the asymptomatic phase of the disease. Moreover, various dMRI metrics tracked with estimated disease progression, suggesting that they could prove useful to estimate where a given individual stands along the disease spectrum and the risk of phenoconversion. While this study represents an early effort to examine the contribution of NODDI to decipher WM changes in f-FTLD, our results highlight the promising role of this imaging technique to detect the earliest brain abnormalities in MAPT mutations and to potentially optimize clinical trials.",

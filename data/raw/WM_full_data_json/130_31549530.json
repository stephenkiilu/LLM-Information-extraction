    "abstract": "Object: Alzheimers disease is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder associated with brain alterations. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has contributed to identify degeneration in white matter cortical microstructural that can be considered an early and specific biomarker for Alzheimers disease. This review aimed to provide a summary of DTI studies on white matter damage in Alzheimers disease. Methods: On PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, we reviewed the studies that used DTI for assessing fractional anisotropy in neurofiber tracts involved in Alzheimers Disease progression: fornix, the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum. We included nine studies that met search criteria. Results: The results showed decreased fractional anisotropy value in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. White matter diffusivity changes were associated with the progression of Alzheimers disease. Conclusion: Microstructural alterations of the limbic and cortico-cortical tracts could be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis in preclinical disease phase.",

      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive decline in elderly subjects 1 and affects around of 35.6 million people 2. AD is characterized by deposition of two proteins beta-amyloid and tau, that leads to a loss of cortical neurons with consequent specific brain atrophy and white matter (WM) alterations 3456. AD has a prolonged prodromal and preclinical phase initially characterized by presence of silent pathological alterations (preclinical phase) and followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 3. MCI represents an intermediate state between normal aging and AD, and approximately in 50 of MCI patients could be described as AD precursor 7. In particular, amnestic MCI subtype seems to be at greater risk to develop in AD 8,9.\nAD is associated with gray matter (GM) atrophy and WM changes also in early stage of disease 10. However, it is not known if WM damage could be considered a primary early pathological sign in MCI and AD 11. Structural integrity of WM can be investigated in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 121314. DTI is a recently evolved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to survey the integrity of WM fiber bundles in normal aging and aging-related disorders, through measuring directional changes in water diffusion 15. Diffusion metrics are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) that are indices of tissue integrity. DTI investigations have computed axial (DA) and radial diffusivity data (DR) in addition to FA and MD 16. DTI studies on AD showed that the posterior cerebral regions, such as corpus callosum, cingulum, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus are involved in early stages of neurodegeneration 13,14,17,18. In addition, DTI investigation showed that AD is associated with the degeneration of the limbic cortices and their WM connections 19. Indeed, the thalamic subregions projecting to temporal cortex and the anterior nuclei projecting to temporal lobe result damaged in AD patients 20.\nThis review is aimed to summarize the studies on WM degeneration in early stage of AD.",

      "text": "Of the 265 studies identified, only 9 studies met the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). All studies were conducted on 222 AD patients 199 MCI and 200 HC (Table 1). ROI-based approach, VOIs (Volumes of interest), voxelbased analysis, as TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics), atlas-based Tractography approach, and FMRIBS Diffusion Toolbox v2.0 were used for tensor data analysis. In particular, we have selected studies on microstructural changes of tracts involved in AD progression: corpus callosum, cingulum and cingulate Huang et al. 23 studied limbic and commissural DTI tracts. A total of 61 subjects were recruited, including 26 AD, 11 MCI and 24 HC. The findings reported lower FA, in AD subjects, in body of fornix, cingulate gyrus and hippocampus in limbic tract. A reduced FA in AD patients was also found in body of corpus callosum, included commissural tracts, genu and splenium. If compared to HC, AD patients showed significant FA value difference only in limbic and commissural tract. Furthermore, in this study, FA changes values in MCI subjects were not statistically significant compared to AD patients. Also, Pievani et al. 15 used DTI MRI-based tractography to investigate WM alterations in 25 AD subjects, 19 MCI and 15 HC analyzing limbic system (fornix and cingulum) and cortico-cortical association pathways (uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum). The authors found differences in FA of fornix in all groups and a higher FA reduced in AD patients 0.38(0.03). In addition, significant WM alterations in limbic and cortico-cortical tracts were found in MCI and AD patients. Oishi et al. 24 investigated specifically, whether a FA reduction in the fornix would be identifiable in AD patients and, if this reduction could predict conversion from control to MCI and from MCI to AD. In this study, 23 AD, 24 MCI and 25 HC were included. FA reduction in fornix body was identified by the color-scaled FA map. The reproducibility of the fornix sign was evaluated between baseline MRI scans and after 1 year. A significant difference in fornix was found in 3 groups. The evaluated max-FA and mean-FA were significantly lower in AD than MCI and HC groups, and there was no difference between MCI and HC. The fornix sign was a promoting imaging biomarker of AD.\nChoo et al. 25 investigated the volumetric changes of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), entorhinal cortex (ERC), hippocampus and regional alteration of cingulum in 19 MCI, 19 AD patients and 18 HC. Authors used DTI to obtain FA of parahippocampal cingulum (PH-C), posterior cingulate cingulum (PC-C) and middle cingulate cingulum (MC-C). Results showed in MCI patients a significantly lower PH-C FA than HC and in AD patients a lower bilateral PH-C and left PC-C FA values than HCs. MC-C FA values were similar in 3 groups. FA reduction was most relevant in the parahippocampal region in MCI, while in AD was found FA reduction in the cingulum fibers of posterior cingulate and parahippocampal region areas.\nLiu et al. 26 analyzed microstructural abnormalities between two subtypes of MCI, amnestic MCI single domain (MCI-s) and MCI multiple domain (MCI-m) compared to 23 HC. Authors found that MCI groups showed a reduced FA in right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), than HC; in addition, aMCI-s showed significantly decreased FA values in left SLF, left Uncinate Fasciculus and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, more than aMCI-m group. So, although FA abnormalities are common in both aMCI groups, these findings suggested that the two types of aMCI have different DTI pathways. Authors hypothesized that DTI, in comparison with traditional imaging and neuropsychological evaluation, could represent a sensitive technique for differential diagnosis of aMCI-s and aMCI-m. To investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal change in the integrity of WM microstructure in AD patients, Elahi et al. 27 used DTI metrics (FA and MD) as surrogate biomarkers of disease progression, identifying regions of WM where the rate of change was significantly faster in AD compared with HC. The AD group showed statistically significant baseline and longitudinal WM degeneration with predominant involvement of posterior tracts. DTI was also used to assess similarities and differences in patterns of WM tract degeneration in syndromic variants of AD, such as dementia of Alzheimers type (DAT), logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) 28. A wholebrain voxel-based analysis was performed to assess differences in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Findings showed, in all groups, an overlap of DTI abnormalities in cerebral networks including fornix, corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. In particular, DAT was associated with degeneration of fornix and cingulum, lvPPA showed DTI alteration in left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus, and PCA revealed WM degeneration in posterior thalamic radiations, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior cingulate, and splenium of the corpus callosum.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Over the past several years, neuroimaging studies have described micro and macrostructural abnormalities in white matter in AD. The use of DTI revealed microstructural changes and reduced anisotropy in already in the early stage of AD and in MCI patients. Several studies showed that the pathological progression of disease involved limbic, commissural and associative tracts and suggested an advances WM degeneration from HC to MCI and MCI to AD 15,23,25,29. In AD physiopathology, WM damage engaged mainly the CC 303132, although Huang et al. 23 found significant decreased FA values only in body of CC. However, the studies that have investigated WM degeneration in AD are discordant. . Some authors 30,31,33 found that splenium was primarily involved already in MCI stage, whereas others reported decreased FA in this cerebral area only in AD patients. Atrophic degeneration of callosal subregions extent to anterior and posterior areas of CC was already found in early stage of disease 21,34. Also the fornix appeared severe affected in preclinical stage of AD, suggesting that it should be selectively more vulnerable than other limbic WM tracts 18,23,32. In particular, the fornix sign seems to be a promising imaging biomarker in preclinical phase of AD 25. Fornixs FA reductions was a pre-symptomatic carrier of familial AD mutation 18,35363738. However, in MCI group significantly FA changes of limbic tracts 24 was found. In addition, previous studies have reported decreased FA of posterior cingulum in MCI subjects 14,33,39, but others have found lower FA in AD patients, and not in MCI 31. Decrease FA in MCI patients in posterior cingulum tracts, was related to CSF T-tau levels, a biological sensitive biomarkers for a probable conversion to AD 40,41. Choo et al. 25 on the contrary, showed that the disruption of cingulum tracts located in parahippocampal area near medial temporal regions, and progresses to posterior cingulum cortex from preclinical to clinically evident stage of AD: decreased FA in AD and MCI patients was found. The cingulum bulb provides connections to prefrontal cortical areas and its disruption could be the structural basis for cognitive impairment in MCI patients 42. Authors found lower FA in limbic network since early stage of pathology; and the degeneration of these tracts will be more severely impaired along the progression of AD 24. The microstructural changes revealed from significant FA reduction were showed also in uncinate, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, marker for AD progression 23, as well as the changes of others diffusivity measures in these WM cortico-subcortical tracts in AD and MCI 14. These connection tracts are involved in cognitive functions, such as attention, memory and executive functions and their integrity may be affected in AD progression 1,17,25,33,43,44. Other literature data confirmed FA decrease of uncinated fasciculus 1,39 associated with reduction of hippocampal volume.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "In the absence of effective treatments for the dementia, there has been an increased focus on understanding the pathological features that occur in the earliest stages of the disease. Pathological features identified at an early stage may be targets for treatment prior to significant cell loss 45. There is an emerging consensus that the focus of AD research should move toward identification of presymptomatic biomarkers. DTI is sensitive to assess the progression of neurodegeneration from an early disease stage. WM microstructural alterations could be considered a potential additive biomarkers for an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders 4,8,17,24,25,44. In particular, WM alterations of limbic and commissural tracts in MCI patients seem to be important marker to assess progression in AD 25. However, WM alterations can be also valuable in terms of neuronal communication which is known to be disrupted in the early phase of the disease to assess the progression of the disease 46. Therefore, it remains possible that microstructural WM declines may in part reflect neuronal dysfunction, since the pattern of WM alterations reported could be due to faulty communication between neuron and oligodendrocyte.\nA small number of works were included in this review since only nine studies met the inclusion criteria. In addition, because of the small sample size the generalization of the clinical results is limited. Future research correlating DTI declines with more direct measures of pathology are required.",

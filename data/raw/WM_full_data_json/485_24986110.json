    "abstract": "In this study, an attempt has been made to find the correlation between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices of white matter (WM) regions and mini mental state examination (MMSE) score of Alzheimer patients. Diffusion weighted images are obtained from the ADNI database. These are preprocessed for eddy current correction and removal of non-brain tissue. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (DA) indices are computed over significant regions (Fornix left, Splenium of corpus callosum left, Splenium of corpus callosum right, bilateral genu of the corpus callosum) affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. The correlation is computed between diffusion indices of the significant regions and MMSE score using linear fit technique so as to find the relation between clinical parameters and the image features. Binary classification has been employed using support vector machine, decision stumps and simple logistic classifiers on the extracted DTI indices along with MMSE score to classify Alzheimer patients from healthy controls. It is observed that distinct values of DTI indices exist for the range of MMSE score. However, there is no strong correlation (Pearsons correlation coefficient r varies from 0.0383 to -0.1924) between the MMSE score and the diffusion indices over the significant regions. Further, the performance evaluation of classifiers shows 94 accuracy using SVM in differentiating AD and control. In isolation clinical and image features can be used for prescreening and diagnosis of AD but no sub anatomic region correlation exist between these features set. The discussion on the correlation of diffusion indices of WM with MMSE score is presented in this study.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused due to the loss of neurons. It is estimated that by the year 2050, one in 85 people in the world will be living with Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique has been used to probe the integrity of WM tracts in vivo. This technique based on the probabilistic determination of diffusion of water molecule in the tissue, helps to quantify the degradation of the WM tracts. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA) and radial diffusivity (RD) are the prominent diffusion indices, which are used to ascertain the degree of the AD pathology 3,4. AD is found to affect specific regions in WM, hence atlas-based approach has been widely used to study the white matter integrity over different regions of interest (ROI) 6.\nMini mental state examination (MMSE) 5 is used as the clinical screening test to assess the subjects basic cognitive ability in several neurodegenerative longitudinal studies. Also this measure is considered for prescreening of AD patients from healthy controls. This score varies from 0 to 30 where 30 represent Normal Control (NC). Various studies have been reported for diagnosis of AD using clinical parameters as well as image features 7,8. Numerous machine learning techniques have been used to classify AD from controls using volumetric change in brain images, cortical thickness analysis, temporal lobe shrinkage and voxel based analysis using DTI features 9,10. However, little importance has been given to ascertain the relation between clinical parameters and the image features to improve the diagnostic relevance.\nThe aim of the present study is twofold. First, to determine the correlation between DTI indices (image features) over prominent sub anatomic regions of WM and MMSE (clinical parameter) score of the subjects. Second, to ascertain the prominence of MMSE parameter along with image features for classification of AD from NC.",

    "Methodology": {
      "text": "Data used in this study is obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http:www.loni.ucla.eduADNI). The dataset of the second phase of ADNI2 and ADNIGO containing DTI images (87 subjects, 50 NC and 37 AD) are used with prior permission of the concerned authority.\nThe data obtained are preprocessed, wherein each subjects entire DWI volumes are aligned with b0 image and eddy current distortion is corrected with the help of FSL eddy-correct tool (www.fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). The resulting volumes are skull stripped using robust Brain Suite tool (http:brainsuite.loni.ucla.edu). Susceptibility artifacts induced due to echo planar imaging, are removed by aligning linearly to their respective T1-weighted structural images using FSL flirt. The images obtained were further elastically registered to T1 scans using an inverse consistent registration algorithm 13. The process employed is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe structural and physiological constraints of WM tracts imply that diffusion of water will vary in the 3-dimensional spherical space predicted by Ficks law and demonstrated by Einsteins equation 12. Maximum flow is observed along the central axis and reduces drastically along other perpendicular co-ordinate axes. The entire diffusion image is mapped into tensor fields with each pixel being represented by an ellipsoidal voxel. Axial length of each ellipsoid represents the magnitude of diffusion at the specified voxel location. The diffusion is quantified using characteristic features calculated for the entire tensor map. The diffusion along each axis of the fiber is calculated as the length of tensor along that direction. The direction of maximum diffusion ( 1 ) 6 along the fiber is estimated as DA. This gives an estimate of the primary direction of fiber structure. RD estimates the average diffusion along the other two perpendicular axes ( 2 , 3 ) 11. MD quantifies the average diffusion along the three axes and thus gives a measure of the total diffusion for each voxel in the tensor map.\nDiffusion along fibrous tracts of WM is characterized by their anisotropic properties. The Eigen values ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) obtained after decomposition of diffusion tensor matrix, gives a measure of the degree of anisotropy in a highly directional structure (WM tracts). FA and MD are the most commonly used features to characterize the integrity and quantify the diffusion in WM tracts. Physical state of neuronal fibers can be estimated by RD and MD. A higher value of RD indicates a thinner myelin sheath. FA is a ratio of the diffusivities along all the directions of WM tracts. The value of FA ranges from zero to one and decreases with degeneration of WM tracts. At the onset of dementia, breakdown occurs at synaptic level, which is better identified by DA, which also gives a measure of continuity of fibers. A decrease in FA may be either due to increase in RD and MD with DA being constant or it may also be due to an decrease in DA and increase in RD with MD being constant 14,15.\nFrom the preprocessed images the diffusion tensor matrix is modeled at each voxel and further the matrix is decomposed into Eigen values ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) to compute following diffusion indices\nwhere m is given by\nThe DTI maps are obtained for FA, MD, DA and RD over 50 ROIs after registering the images with JHU DTI atlas 23. Subsequently, JHU Eve WM atlas labels are applied using nearest neighbor interpolation technique to extract the ROI feature values.\nFurthermore, support vector machine (SVM), simple logistic and decision stumps classification algorithms are custom implemented in MATLAB. SVM works on the principle of margin maximization and is a nonlinear parametric based approach. It uses fewer samples for training and is robust to increase in feature dimension 16. The experimental parameters set for SVM are, polynomial kernel of order 5 is used and the soft margin is set to 1. Simple logistic classifier is based on computation of probability scores to measure the relationship between categorical dependent and independent variables 17. Ridge estimator is used in the Simple Logistic classifier with the value set to 10 -7 . Decision stumps is a single level tree classifier, which makes prediction on the input dataset by using the predictor model 18. The abovementioned classifiers are selected based on the complexity of the algorithm ranging from SVM being complex to decision stumps being simple set of conditional statements. The objective is to analyze the importance of the features in predicting the outcome for both weak and robust classifiers.\nBinary classification technique is employed over the features obtained from the ROIs of DTI map and MMSE score. 10 fold cross validation is used to arrive at classifiers performance for the different combinations of feature set. The performance is evaluated based on the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the classifiers:\nAccuracy  TP  TN TP  TN  FP  FN (7) where true positives (TP) is the number of diseased subjects correctly classified, true negative (TN) is the number of control subjects classified correctly, false positive (FP) is the number of control subjects classified as disease patients and false negative (FN) is the number of disease subjects classified as normal control.\nPearson correlation coefficient (r) is computed between the diffusion indices obtained over the significant regions and MMSE score of each subject using linear fit technique\nwhere X  (\nThe significant regions considered in this work are Fornix, Splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum as these are affected most due to AD pathology, which has been reported by the authors in earlier study 19. 1. The controls and AD subjects are in the same age group but the variance in MMSE score is observed to be higher for AD.\nDTI indices are computed from 50 regions of WM for controls and AD data. A representative set of regions and their corresponding feature indices along with computed P value are shown in Table 3.\nThe comparative variation of DTI indices with MMSE scores for AD and controls for Fornix region of WM and Splenium of corpus callosum is shown in Figs. 2 and3, respectively. Visual observation of figures indicates a clear distinction between the datasets of AD and controls. It can be inferred from the figures that distinct values of DTI indices exist for the range of MMSE score. Thus, diffusion indices and MMSE scores can be used for classification of AD. It is observed that, in AD subjects the value of FA is decreased and values of MD, RD and DA are increased compared to controls.\nFrom Figs. 2 and 3 it could be observed that more than one unique value of DTI indices exist for the same MMSE score. This leads to poor correlation between the two. Linear fit is performed for each set of features from prominent regions and Pearson correlation coefficient r value is computed, which is tabulated in Table 2. A wide range of variation in r value (0.1819 to -0.1924) exists over prominent regions for different SVM classifier is built on the strong theoretical foundation of maximizing the hyper margin by linear discrimination function. A significant change in the predictive score is needed to move the data points across the decision boundary. Hence, SVM performs better than the decision stumps and simple logistic classifiers in distinguishing AD from controls.\nFurther, the proposed method is compared with existing automated analysis techniques to distinguish AD from controls. It can be observed from Table 5 24, that the efficiency of the methods using structural MRI properties is comparatively lesser than the proposed approach. Although, the multivariate approach with combination of structural and diffusion features does provide marginal improvement over the proposed approach. However, the results have to be interpreted with caution as the number of sample subjects considered in the multivariate study is comparatively lesser and also it requires high computation time and analysis to compute both structural and diffusion features. Also, the numbers of ROIs that are considered in multivariate approach are 15 and in proposed approach is only 5. Multivariate approach is dependent entirely on the imaging features whereas proposed approach incorporates the usefulness of clinical parameter.\nIt must be noted that although no correlation is found between image feature values and clinical screening scores,",

      "text": "DTI is used to study WM related abnormalities and it is in recent focus to address AD pathology. Use of DTI for diagnosis of AD using sub-anatomic region analysis of WM is in nascent stage and very few reports have been published on this study.\nIt is also noticed that there are conflicting results about correlation between the diffusion indices of sub anatomic regions of WM and MMSE score. For instance Bozzali and Falini 20 reported strong correlation between FA and MMSE score for entire WM regions whereas Ibrahim et al. 21 showed no correlation exist for the same for corpus callosum in AD patients. Also previous studies have suggested MMSE score as a noisy and unreliable 22 tool for cognitive measure of the subjects as it is affected by depression, sleep deprivation, medical conditions and medications. However, in this study MMSE score is found to be the critical indicator of AD pathology and also a significant feature for the classification of AD from NC. To the best of authors knowledge, no study has been performed considering DTI indices along with MMSE score for classification of AD from NC. The data is acquired from ADNI repository and preprocessed. Further, diffusion indices are extracted from 50 regions of WM. The observations in this study could be comprehended based on correlation of WM sub-anatomic region analysis of DTI indices with MMSE score and classification of AD vs NC.\nFollowing are the inferences that can be derived from this study:\nThere are significant variations in white matter tracts diffusion indices for AD and normal subjects.",

    "abstract": "Background Despite clinical and neuropsychological similarities between Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), recent studies have demonstrated that structural and pathological changes are more severe in DLB than in PDD. Methods 19 patients with probable PDD and 18 patients with probable DLB who had a similar overall severity of dementia and demographic characteristics were examined by a standardised neuropsychological test and voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results The patients with DLB performed significantly worse in visual recognition memory, semantic fluency and ideomotor praxis than those with PDD (p0.05). Compared with controls, the FA value in patients with PDD was significantly lower in bilateral frontal, left temporal and left parietal white matter. In patients with DLB, the pattern of FA reduction was similar to that of patients with PDD; however, white-matter abnormalities were more severe and extended into bilateral insular, bilateral posterior cingular and bilateral visual association regions. In a direct comparison between PDD and DLB, the FA value in patients with DLB was significantly decreased in bilateral posterior temporal, posterior cingular and bilateral visual association fibres extending into occipital areas. Conclusions Despite global similarities in cognitive performance and white-matter pathology between DLB and PDD patients, those with DLB had more severely impaired frontal and temporal area-associated cognitive subsets, and more severe white-matter pathology in temporal and visual association fibres. These data suggest that differences in the underlying nature of PDD and DLB may exist with global similarities in their cognitive performance and white-matter pathology.",

      "text": "Parkinsons disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) share many clinical and neurobiological similarities, including similar motor symptoms, neuropsychological profiles, and neurochemical and neuropathological characteristics of a-synuclein. 1e4 The clinical distinction between PDD and DLB is the timing of the onset of cognitive symptoms relative to parkinsonian motor symptoms.\nDespite the clinical and neuropsychological similarities between these two diseases, recent functional imaging and neuropathological data have demonstrated that the burden of Alzheimer disease-like pathology and the density of Lewy bodies are more severe in DLB than PDD. 1 5e7 Some studies using direct voxel-based comparison of cortical metabolic or atrophic patterns between these two disease have demonstrated that patients with DLB have more cortical derangement than those with PDD. 8 9 The few studies that used formal neuropsychological tests to directly compare the cognitive profiles of patients with PDD and those with DLB demonstrated that those with DLB had a trend for poorer performance in executive functions, attention or visual recognition memory, 10e12 even though another study reported no differences in cognitive profiles. 13 These studies suggest that different brain substrates may be responsible for the dementia in PDD and DLB.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently been introduced for in vivo estimation of white-matter tissue composition and is capable of detecting subtle white-matter abnormalities before volume loss becomes apparent. 14 The diffusion of water molecules in normal white matter is imposed on the ordered structure of axons and myelin sheaths, called fractional anisotropy (FA). White-matter pathology disrupts the coherent orientation of axons, leading to decreased tissue FA. 15 Thus, anisotropy is an index of the organisation of axons and allows the demonstration of fibre tracts. In this study, we compared directly cognitive profiles and white-matter tissue composition using a voxelbased analysis of DTI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable PDD and DLB with a hypothesis that more severe and extensive neuropathology in DLB than in PDD may contribute to different patterns in these two diseases.",

    "METHODS Subjects": {
      "text": "Participants were recruited consecutively from a university hospital. We prospectively enrolled 19 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable PDD and 18 patients with probable DLB. The diagnosis of DLB was made according to the consensus criteria for DLB. 2 PD and PDD were diagnosed according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the UK Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank 16 and clinical diagnosis criteria for PDD, 17 respectively. The onset of PD in all the patients with PDD preceded the development of dementias by at least 12 months. Exclusion criteria included evidence of focal brain lesions by MRI or the presence of other neurodegenerative diseases that may account for the dementia. To evaluate the white-matter abnormalities, we analysed the history of cerebrovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and hyperlipidaemia) and white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) score in patients with PDD and DLB. This WHM score was determined by grading the extent of increased white-matter signal intensity on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence images in the periventricular and subcortical whitematter area. The grading was based on a 10-point scale (0 to 9), with a higher score indicating a more severe white-matter grade. 18 19 Possible medical comorbidities were also excluded by laboratory tests, including a thyroid function test, vitamin B 12 and folic acid levels, and a VDRL test. To compare a voxel-based analysis of DTI in patients with PDD and DLB, age-and sex-matched healthy, elderly control persons were recruited among elderly people from volunteers after information about the project or healthy relatives of patients with movement disorders or dementia (n¼18, age¼71.266.5 years). The controls had no active neurological disorder. They had no cognitive complaints with a minimal Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) score of 28. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects, and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first application of DTI analysis to directly compare white-matter pathology between patients with PDD and DLB along with neuropsychological profiles. Our study demonstrated that even though similar global cognitive profiles were seen between two diseases, patients with DLB showed a significantly poorer performance in subsets of cognitive profiles such as visual recognition memory, semantic fluency and ideomotor praxis. In addition, the voxel-based analysis of DTI showed that patients with DLB had more severe microstructural damage in white matter adjacent to posterior temporal and occipital areas. In this study, the overall dementia severity or demographic characteristics in patients with PDD and DLB who underwent neuropsychological assessments were no different, and the pattern of white-matter abnormalities was unchanged after the CDR adjustment. Thus, the different patterns of the cognitive subsets and white-matter abnormalities may reflect a difference in the underlying nature of these two diseases.\nIn a comparison of the cognitive profiles between patients with PDD and DLB whose MMSE score indicated a mild stage of dementia, Aarsland et al 12 and Downes et al 10 demonstrated that executive function was more severely impaired in patients with DLB than in those with PDD. Recently, Mondon et al 11 reported that patients with DLB whose MMSE score fell in the range of moderate dementia had a poorer performance in orientation, visual recognition memory and visual storage capacity than did PDD patients. In our patients whose MMSE scores also indicated moderate dementia, those with DLB showed a poorer performance in attention, executive function, and visual and verbal recognition memory. These data suggest that although PDD and DLB would share similar global cognitive patterns, patients with DLB may have more severe, persistent cognitive deficits in frontal and temporal-related cognitive subsets from mild to moderate stages of dementia, relative to PDD patients. Accordingly, differences in cognitive profile between PDD and DLB may start in the early stage of two diseases and continue with disease progression, which may be suggestive of difference in the underlying disease nature. In a voxel-based analysis of DTI, overall patterns of decreased FA values in patients with PDD and DLB compared with controls were similar; however, white-matter abnormalities were more severe and widespread in patients with DLB relative to those with PDD. Patients with PDD showed involvement in extensive areas of frontal white-matter in addition to a small area of temporal and parietal white matter, whereas whitematter abnormalities in patients with DLB were more widespread in frontal areas and were also seen in temporal, insular, posterior cingular and visual association white-matter across posterior temporal and occipital areas. The pattern of decreased FA values in PDD relative to controls is similar to that in a previous study using a regions of interest (ROI) analysis except for FA values in the occipital and parietal white matter, 25 which may be ascribed to differences in the imaging analysis and demographic characteristics (general cognition and range of age in controls). Regarding the white-matter abnormalities in DLB, previous studies show different patterns; two studies using ROI analysis demonstrated white-matter abnormalities in widespread area or temporo-occipital area, 26 27 whereas one study using VBM analysis showed no white-matter abnormalities. 28 Although our results are generally similar to those two reports, white-matter abnormalities are more extensive. Along with heterogeneity in the diffusion measurement, generally more severe cognition relative to disease duration in our study than previous studies may lead to more severe white-matter abnormalities. In a direct comparison between patients with PDD and DLB, the areas where white-matter pathology was more severe in DLB than in PDD were localised to bilateral posterior temporal, posterior cingular and bilateral visual association fibres extending into occipital areas. Thus, our DTI data may suggest that with an overlap pathology in white matter commonly underlying these two diseases, other pathological substrates leading to more severe white-matter pathology in DLB than in PDD may exist.\nInterestingly, the area where white-matter pathology was more severe in DLB relative to PDD seems to generally correspond with anatomical substrates responsible for differences in cognitive subsets between these two diseases. Regarding the visual-recognition memory that was more severely impaired in our patients with DLB than in PDD, Barbeau et al 29 suggested that visual-recognition memory is independent of frontal function and may be associated with the temporal lobe, including mesial and lateral temporal areas in their voxel-based morphometry study. Mondon et al 11 also pointed out more functional alterations in temporal regions as responsible anatomical sites to differentiate cognitive profiles in DLB from PDD. Thus, it is plausible that more severe microstructural alterations in temporal white matter and their connection to visual association fibres may explain the greater dysfunction of visual recognition memory in patients with DLB compared with those with PDD. Second, the most prominent white-matter abnormalities differentiating DLB from PDD in our study were localised to visual association fibres. This is in accordance with a recent DTI study showing that visual association fibres were significantly altered in patients with DLB, 27 although our study could not discriminate the individual fibres exactly, since our study was not based on analysis of ROI. The most distinguishing clinical feature of DLB is visual hallucination. The pathoanatomical substrate for visual hallucination in DLB is not conclusive; however, recent functional imaging and neuropathological studies have suggested functional or pathological alterations in the temporal or temporo-occipital area as an anatomical candidate for visual hallucination. Yamamoto et al 30 suggested that more severe LB pathology in the secondary visual pathway and the inferior temporal cortex in DLB patients may induce visual stimulus-related cognition and visual misidentification. In addition, Harding et al 7 showed that DLB patients had higher LB densities in the inferior temporal cortex than PDD patients and well-formed visual hallucinations were well correlated with the temporal lobe LB. Along with decreased visual-recognition memory, these data showing more prevalent in visual hallucination in patients with DLB than in those with PDD may be associated with more severe white-matter pathology in visual association fibres extending into temporal areas in patients with DLB. Third, the increased tendency for deficits in the frontalassociated cognitive subsets of executive function, semantic fluency and ideomotor praxis in DLB patients is consistent with a tendency for more severe frontal white-matter pathology in these patients than in those with PDD. However, the severity of frontal white-matter pathology in the DLB group compared with the PDD group was less prominent than the severity of whitematter abnormalities in temporo-occipital areas.\nUntil now, the pathoanatomical mechanisms underlying different patterns of cognitive profiles and microstructural white-matter alterations in DLB and PDD are still speculative. According to previous reports, together with more widespread burden of LB densities in DLB patients, more severe b-amyloid burden may lead to the more severe pathological changes in DLB. 7 31e35 In particular, in vivo data using PIB positron emission tomography have demonstrated that the cortical amyloid burden was higher in the DLB group than in the PDD group and is comparable with the burden in patients with AD group. 32 33 However, the cortical amyloid burden in those studies was not region-specific, making it difficult to explain why the more severe white-matter pathology in our patients with DLB was restricted to temporo-occipital areas. In this regard, it is possible that in DLB patients, the interaction of LB showing more severe densities in temporo-occipital areas with b-amyloid burden may lead to accelerated microstructural alterations in these areas, as suggested by Masliahs group which found that b-amyloid promotes a-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in vivo through the stabilisation in the formation of hybrid nanopores that alter neuronal activity. 36 37 Some limitations in our study need to be addressed. First, the diagnosis of PDD and DLB in our study was not based on histopathological confirmation and thus raises the possibility of misdiagnosis, especially for DLB. However, it is known that the specificity in clinical diagnosis of DLB is high when consensus diagnostic criteria for DLB is applied. 2 Second, our small sample size and large intragroup variability may have limited the detection of group differences, especially in the comparison of neuropsychological profiles and FA values between the two diseases.\nIn summary, a comparison of cognitive profiles and whitematter tissue composition between patients with PDD or DLB demonstrated that despite global similarities in their cognitive performance and white-matter pathology, the patients with DLB had more severely impaired frontal and temporal areaassociated cognitive subsets, along with more severe whitematter alterations in temporal and visual association fibres. Even though controversy still exists as to whether PDD and DLB are indeed the same disease entities, these data suggest that differences in the underlying nature of PDD and DLB may exist with global similarities in their cognitive performance and whitematter pathology.",

    "abstract": "Background: DTI is sensitive to white matter (WM) microstructural damage and has been suggested as a surrogate marker for phase 2 clinical trials in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). The studys objective is to establish the best way to analyse the diffusion-weighted imaging data in SVD for this purpose. The ideal method would be sensitive to change and predict dementia conversion, but also straightforward to implement and ideally automated. As part of the OPTIMAL collaboration, we evaluated five different DTI analysis strategies across six different cohorts with differing SVD severity. Methods: Those 5 strategies were: (1) conventional mean diffusivity WM histogram measure (MD median), (2) a principal component-derived measure based on conventional WM histogram measures (PC1), (3) peak width skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), (4) diffusion tensor image segmentation θ (DSEG θ) and ( 5 ) a WM measure of global network efficiency (Geff). The association between each measure and cognitive function was tested using a linear regression model adjusted by clinical markers. Changes in the imaging measures over time were determined. In three cohort studies, repeated imaging data together with data on incident dementia were available. The association between the baseline measure, change measure and incident dementia conversion was examined using Cox proportional-hazard regression or logistic regression models. Sample size estimates for a hypothetical clinical trial were furthermore computed for each DTI analysis strategy.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a highly prevalent condition which causes lacunar stroke, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia (Wardlaw et al., 2019). Characteristic appearances seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (Pantoni, 2010). Cognitive impairment is common, with early impairment of executive function and information processing speed (Lawrence et al., 2013). SVD is the most common vascular pathology underlying VCI, although only a small proportion of patients with radiological features of SVD will progress to dementia within a few years (Amin Al Olama et al., 2020;Debette et al., 2019;Debette and Markus, 2010;Lawrence et al., 2017;Prins et al., 2004;Wu et al., 2019).\nDespite the enormous global burden of SVD in causing stroke, dementia and, disability, there are few effective treatments for the disease (Smith and Markus, 2020). One challenge is that large sample sizes are required to examine new therapies using clinical outcomes such as recurrent stroke, cognitive decline and dementia (Amin Al Olama et al., 2020;Baykara et al., 2016;Benjamin et al., 2016;Lawrence et al., 2015;Nam et al., 2017). Moreover, cognitive testing has been shown to be relatively insensitive as an endpoint measure in phase 2 trials. Hence, there is increasing interest in the use of other markers including MRI as a surrogate endpoint to allow evaluation of therapies with smaller sample sizes in phase 2 trials, prior to scaling to primary clinical endpoints in larger phase 3 trials (Baykara et al., 2016;Benjamin et al., 2016;Lawrence et al., 2015;Schmidt et al., 2004).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed as a promising surrogate marker in SVD trials (Baykara et al., 2016;van den Brink et al., 2022;Zeestraten et al., 2017Zeestraten et al., , 2016)). DTI measures have been shown to be sensitive to white matter (WM) damage in SVD both within WMH and in apparently normal appearing WM (OSullivan et al., 2004;Pasi et al., 2016). In cross-sectional studies DTI measures correlated with cognitive impairment more strongly than WMH (Croall et al., 2017;Lawrence et al., 2013;Tuladhar et al., 2015). Recent longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that both baseline DTI, and change in DTI, predict future dementia risk (Egle et al., 2022;Power et al., 2019;van Uden et al., 2016;Zeestraten et al., 2017). Changes in DTI markers can be detected over periods as little as 1-3 years, which are time durations often used in phase 2 clinical trials (Markus et al., 2021;Nitkunan et al., 2008;van Leijsen et al., 2019;Williams et al., 2019Williams et al., , 2017;;Zeestraten et al., 2016).\nHowever, DTI analysis can be time consuming, and automated or semi-automated analysis techniques that are robust across different sites and populations are attractive, particularly for clinical trials. Such methods include Peak width of Skeletonized Mean diffusivity (PSMD), a DTI-derived measure based on skeletonization and histogram analysis, (Baykara et al., 2016) and Diffusion tensor image SEGmentation θ (DSEG θ) a diffusion tensor image (DTI) segmentation technique to describe SVD related changes in a single unitary score across the whole cerebrum ( (Baykara et al., 2016;Williams et al., 2017). Previous analyses have tended to focus on one DTI histogram measure such as MD median or MD peak height. However, it is possible that analyzing multiple measures improves prediction. The reason for this is that different DTI parameters represent slightly different aspects of pathology; for example radial diffusivity (RD) has been suggested as a marker of myelin loss and axial diffusivity (AxD) as a marker of demyelination (Song et al., 2002;Winklewski et al., 2018). Techniques such as principal component analysis which summarize different DTI measures may therefore show better prediction than a single histogram measure. Lastly advanced MRI diffusion data and tractography can be used to reconstruct WM tracts and networks, and measures of the integrity of such brain networks have been shown to correlate strongly with impaired cognitive function, and predict future dementia risk (Lawrence et al., 2018(Lawrence et al., , 2014;;Tuladhar et al., 2016b).\nThe overall aim of the OPTIMAL (OPtimising mulTImodal MRI markers for use as surrogate markers in trials of Vascular Cognitive Impairment due to cerebrAl small vesseL disease) collaboration is to find the most efficient way of using MRI measures in clinical trials. A previous OPTIMAL study demonstrated that conventional WM DTI measures such as MD median predicted impaired cognitive function and dementia conversion in SVD and MCI patient cohorts (Egle et al., 2022). In this OPTIMAL study, we compared the performance of different strategies of quantifying diffusion-weighted imaging, including MD median, in predicting conversion to dementia and impaired cognitive function. We then used the data to determine sample sizes for a potential intervention study using the different DTI approaches as endpoints. WM ultrastructural damage, characterised by DTI, has been associated with cognitive not only in patients with symptomatic SVD, but also in elderly community populations, and in cohorts with MCI; in all groups WM damage due to SVD has been postulated to play a role in cognitive impairment. For this reason, we assessed the performance of makers across a range of cohorts including both severe and mild SVD, healthy elderly community subjects, and subjects with MCI. For our analyses, we used all-cause dementia as the primary outcome measure. This is because is the most relevant outcome measures for a clinical trial, because accurate diagnosis of subtypes in life may be inaccurate and related to the later point because population-based studies have shown at post-mortem that most cases of dementia have a mixed pathology often including vascular changes of SVD (Schneider et al., 2007;Toledo et al., 2013).",

The 5 histogram measures for each of the maps were: Median, normalised peak height (PH), peak value, skew, kurtosis. Hence, 20 histogram measures were computed for each patient.\nUsing SPM12b (Statistical parametric mapping), T1-weighted scans were segmented into grey matter, WM and cerebral spinal fluid tissue probability maps (TPM) (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). MD, FA, AxD and RD maps were generated with DTIFIT, part of the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) (Behrens et al., 2007(Behrens et al., , 2003)). Employing FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001), FLAIR to T1weighted and T1-weighted to b0 registrations (the average of all the b  0 s mm -2 images in the DTI sequence) were employed (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) and the affine transformation matrices were concatenated to generate a FLAIR-to-DTI transformation. Employing these transformations, TPMs were registered into DTI space. Hard segmentations were carried out to generate maps of tissue classes. This was done by voxel wise comparison of the different tissue probability maps, whereby voxels were allotted to the highest probability tissue class. Mask images of all WM were created based on the hard segmentation map. A histogram analysis was conducted on the MD, FA, RD and AxD maps in the WM regions. 5 WM summary measures (i.e., median, peak value, normalised peak height, skew and kurtosis) for each of the diffusion maps were obtained from normalized histograms with 1000 bins (MD range: 0-4 mm 2 s -1 x 10 -3 , bin width: 0.004 mm 2 s -1  10 -3 ; FA range: 0-1, bin width 0.001).",

The computation is divided into three main modules: 1) WM tract skeletonization using tract-based statistics (TBSS) and the FMRIB 1-mm fractional anisotropy template thresholded at an FA value of 0.2 (Smith et al., 2006). MD images were projected onto the skeleton employing the FA-derived projection parameters.

      "text": "Brain networks can be constructed using DTI tractography data, and a measure of global efficiency has been shown to predict dementia in a lacunar stroke cohort (Lawrence et al., 2018). Except for the network baseline data in RUN DMC (Tuladhar et al., 2016a), the construction of brain networks was performed using the same technique across all cohorts and the computation is summarized as follows:\n1) for all cohort data 90 brain regions (80 cortical and 10 subcortical regions) defined from the AAL parcellation of the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei (Desikan et al., 2006) were employed as nodes, excluding those in the cerebellum. 2) employing DTIFIT, a diffusion tensor model was fitted to each voxel in all cohort data except for RUN DMC baseline (Jenkinson et al., 2012). In RUN DMC at baseline the diffusion tensor and FA was computed using the TrackVis Diffusion Toolkit (https:www.tra ckvis.org). 3) using ANTS (stnava.github.ioANTs), the standard space template FMRIB58_FA_1mm was registered to the patients FA maps in all cohort data except for RUN DMC at baseline. The AAL atlas was then transformed to the patients FA image using the nearest-neighbour interpolation method and the transformation matrix generated by the registration. In RUN DMC at baseline skull stripped T1-weighted images were nonlinearly registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 template employing the Function MRI of the Brain nonlinear registration tool (FNIRT) (Andersson et al., 2007). The transformation matrix derived by registering the b0-images to T1weighted subject space was used to register the AAL images to each patients diffusion image space with FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). 4) whole-brain deterministic tractography using MRtrix (Tournier et al., 2012) was performed on the principal eigenvector in all cohort data but RUN DMC at baseline. Streamlines (max number per voxel  4, length  20-250 nm, step size  0.5 mm) were generated employing trilinear interpolation of the tensor field. Streamlines terminated in regions where FA0.15 or the angle turn between consecutive vectors was greater than 45. Brain regions were classified as being linked to each other under the condition that at least one streamline terminating in region A also terminated in region B.\nThe strength of connectivity between two seeds was determined by the streamline count adjusted by the length of the streamline in mm.\nIn RUN DMC at baseline whole-brain deterministic tractography was applied using the fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm (Tuladhar et al., 2016a). Fiber tracks were launched at the voxels center with FA greater than 0.2 and terminated either when leaving the brain mask, when coming across voxels with FA smaller than 0.2 or when the angle turn being greater than 60. Two brain regions were classified as being connected when the reconstructed streamline linked both regions. The weight of connectivity between two seeds was computed by multiplying the mean FA for each reconstructed streamline by the total number of reconstructed streamlines linking two regions. The number of reconstructed streamlines may correspond to the WM structure and has commonly been employed as weighting of edges in graph-theoretical studies.\nUnder the condition that 2 edges share a similar number of streamlines, the weights may still be different when FA is considered. The connection strength was normalised by the volume of AAL regions and the differences in brain size (Brown et al., 2011). 5) based on the strength of connectivity, the connectome was reconstructed as an undirected graph and the adjacency matrix was generated as a symmetric matrix. Each matrixs element indicated the strength of connectivity between individual pairs of brain regions. Graph-theory analysis was used to compute the summary measure weighted global network efficiency (Geff) (www. brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) (Latora and Marchiori, 2001;Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). The Geff measure indicates the degree of connectivity between nodes of the brain network relative to an idealized network where every node is connected.",

In the SCANS cohort with multiple follow-ups, a linear mixed model was fitted for MD Median, PSMD, DSEG θ and Geff (Bates et al., 2015). We included follow-up time as a fixed effect and included random intercepts and slopes for each participant. The average fixed effects slopes of time were interpreted as the average annualized change rate in a given imaging measure per additional year of follow-up. The statistical significance of change in DTI measures was determined using a paired t-test in all cohorts with 1 follow-up time point. In PRESERVE it was also tested as to whether there were differences in the temporal change of DTI measures between scanner sites while accounting for the markers baseline measure using an ANCOVA model with permutation (Wheeler, 2010).\nTo create a compound longitudinal DTI measure for the dementia analysis, a PCA was applied to the changes of 19 DTI markers used at baseline in SCANS and to all 20 DTI markers in RUN DMC and HAR-MONISATION (Lê et al., 2008). In SCANS no individual trajectories of AxD Median could be estimated due to limited variability in the data when using a linear mixed model.

This has raised awareness of DTI as an attractive surrogate endpoint for clinical trials in SVD. However, how best to analyse DTI data remains uncertain. An ideal analysis technique would combine a simple automated technique, with high sensitivity to change and dementia conversion. In this study, we compared 5 different DTI analysis approaches by comparing associations of each with cognition at baseline, and with future dementia conversion.\nWe were not able to identify a single optimal analysis strategy. Except for the asymptomatic SVD cohort ASPS-Fam, all analysis techniques were significantly associated with global cognition or executive function at baseline.

      "text": "Change in DTI measures in each cohort studies. There were significant changes in all measures in all cohorts except for PRESERVE and CADASIL. In PRESERVE there was a significant change DSEG and MD Median but not for PSMD and Geff. In CADASIL there was only a marginally significant change for Geff. Differentiating between dementia subtypes in RUN DMC, all baseline DTI measures, except for DSEG, were significantly different between patients converting to VD dementia and those converting to AD dementia. The differences in DTI measure profiles indicated more severe WM ultrastructural damage in those converting to VD. Previous studies also showed different etio-pathogenic profiles of WM microstructure between VD and AD dementia (Fu et al., 2012;Tu et al., 2017). Whereas patients with SVD had global changes in DTI measures across many brain regions, patients with AD demonstrated more regionally confined microstructural WM changes.\nThere were significant changes in all DTI metrics over time in all single-center sporadic SVD and MCI cohorts. In the multicentre cohort PRESERVE, the network analysis and PSMD were not sensitive to change. The combined PC1 measure was not a better predictor for dementia conversion, as evidenced by AUC, than one of its underlying single measures, i.e., MD median. Despite the significant changes over time in all DTI measures, consistent associations with dementia conversion were only found in the severe SVD cohort, i.e., SCANS, and not in the 2 cohorts with AD dementia as the most prevalent subtype.\nSince the analysis techniques were similar in their predictive ability, then ease of use and the degree of automation become important factors. PSMD allows for a fully automated analysis without any tissue segmentation, that may require checking and correction, making it suitable for rapid analysis of large data sets. PSMD performed well across all cohorts except for detecting change in the PRESERVE cohort. In the PRESERVE cohort 86 had been scanned on a Philips scanner. The sensitivity of PSMD has been shown to be affected by images from the Philips scanner especially when there was a software update during the study (https:www.psmd-marker.comfaq) and this may be a limitation. Another automatic skeletonized measure, called Mean Skeletonized Mean Diffusivity (MSMD), was sensitive to change in PRESERVE (eFigure 9). MSMD may therefore offer a better marker than PSMD when using Philips scanners. A further advantage of PSMD is that it is freely available. DSEG θ is semi-automated method requiring some user input such as choosing the reference brain. It performed well across datasets and may also be useful for use in clinical trials. However, it is not yet openly available.\nWe studied patient cohorts with a range of SVD, from mild changes in a stroke and dementia free community population (ASPS-Fam), through to patients with severe symptomatic SVD with confluent WMH (SCANS) and patients with monogenic SVD (CADASIL). The previous OPTIMAL study showed that changes in WM microstructure may contribute to cognitive impairment in all cohorts and in those cohorts in which data on future dementia risk was available predicted dementia (Egle et al., 2022). This emphasizes a key role for WM microstructure and cognitive decline across the range of disease severity, not only in pure SVD, but also in an MCI cohort in whom the predominant future dementia type is AD, and the utility of DTI metrics in capturing this. It was notable that in PRESERVE the amount of variance in cognition explained by DTI metrics was lower. This is likely to reflect the multicentre nature of PRESERVE, in which DTI was performed on several different scanners across different sites. In contrast the other studies utilized imaging on a single scanner. To solve these challenges associated with acquisition-related differences of diffusion MRI, a promising DTI harmonization technique has been successfully tested on various SVD cohorts (de Brito Robalo et al., 2021). Ideally, however, in a clinical trial harmonization, or even standardization, should be implemented at the level of the acquisition.\nWe used the data from this study to estimate sample size calculations for a trial in SVD. With a treatment effect of 20 , which would be typical for many intervention studies, sample sizes of a few hundred would be required. Sample sizes were generally low for DSEG θ, and only slightly higher for PSMD. In contrast, the network measure Geff needed a high minimum sample size in all 4 cohorts.\nThe study has several strengths. We compared several different DTI parameters across multiple independent datasets. Analysis methods were evaluated on additional datasets on which they had not been developed. However, it also has limitations. Firstly, different durations and number of follow-up time points were used which may have affected the findings across cohorts with varying SVD severity. Strong associations between DTI changes and dementia conversion were only found in the cohort characterized by more severe sporadic SVD progression, with multiple observational follow-up points. Annual follow-up time points in RUN DMC may have resulted in similar findings as in SCANS. Second, different MRI acquisition parameters were employed for the different cohorts potentially affecting the results. Third, different DTI preprocessing has been applied for different cohorts, nevertheless the results were relatively consistent between the cohorts. The Geff generated from the RUN DMC data differs in scale to that from the other datasets, this is most likely due to the differences in processing between this dataset and those processed centrally. While this may be a limitation, we felt it important to preserve the compatibility between the data published here and in other papers using it. Fourth, these DTI measures were all based on single-shell DTI. However, multi-shell DTI and higher DTI models may be more informative to characterize the WM microstructure, perhaps leading to lower sample sizes.\nA further consideration is that we included a range of severity of disease pathologies in our study. Some represented severe SVD in whom the predominant pathology which may cause dementia is vascular, and this was reflected in the dementia cases in SCANS being vascular. In others, such as the MCI cohort, the predominant dementia pathology is likely to be AD, although the strong prediction provided by DTI suggests that WM changes are also important. Consistent with this, most dementia cases were AD. Interestingly in RUN DMC in which the inclusion criteria were symptomatic SVD due to stroke, cognitive or motor symptoms, most dementia cases were AD emphasizing that in elderly populations mixed pathology is the major pathology underlying dementia.\nIn conclusion, all DTI approaches at baseline predict future dementia risk in SVD and may be useful surrogate endpoints in clinical trials of SVD. We found no clear difference between different DTI strategies but automated methods such as PSMD offer clear advantages in large studies. PSMD performed well overall except for the PRESERVE dataset, possibly due to difficulties in using it on Philips sequences. DSEG θ performed well overall. Whilst these methods did not show marked improvement over simple histogram methods, they are easier to implement in large clinical studies.",

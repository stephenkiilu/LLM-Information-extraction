    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GM volume, WMH volume, and FA are each associated with cognition; however, few studies have detected whether these 3 different types of MR imaging measurements exert independent or additive effects on cognitive performance. To detect their extent of contribution to cognitive performance, we explored the independent and additive contributions of GM atrophy, white matter injury, and white matter integrity to cognition in elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and 9 elderly patients participated in the study: 97 were CN adults, 65 had MCI, and 47 had dementia. We measured GM on T1-weighted MR imaging, WMH on FLAIR, and FA on DTI, along with psychometrically matched measures of 4 domains of cognitive performance, including semantic memory, episodic memory, executive function, and spatial abilities. RESULTS: As expected, patients with dementia performed significantly more poorly in all 4 cognitive domains, whereas patients with MCI performed generally less poorly than dementia patients, though considerable overlap in performance was present across groups. GM, FA, and WMH each differed significantly between diagnostic groups and were associated with cognitive measures. In multivariate models that included all 3 MR imaging measures (GM, WMH, and FA), GM volume was the strongest determinant of cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that MR imaging measures of GM are more closely associated with cognitive function than WM measures across a broad range of cognitive and functional impairment.

      "text": "M R imaging-based brain volumetric measurements are widely used in clinical studies of aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease. Multiple reports confirm that global GM loss is significantly associated with advancing age and the onset and progression of AD. 1 The extent of GM loss in AD is associated with cognitive performance. 1,2 In addition, increased WMH burden on FLAIR MR imaging has been observed in both MCI 3,4 and clinical AD, 3,5 and is associated with diminished episodic memory and executive function. 6,7 More recently, studies of white matter microstructural integrity using FA derived from DTI 8,9 have shown that FA in the temporal lobe, posterior cingulum bundle, and fornix is reduced in dementia 10,11 and MCI, 12 while FA in the corpus callosum may be reduced in CN elders. 13 Reduced FA in these tracts is also associated with poor memory performance. 14 Prior studies, however, have generally failed to assess whether different types of MR imaging measurements exert independent or additive effects on cognitive performance. Addressing this issue could have important implications for understanding the biologic underpinnings of age-associated cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia. In particular, because GM loss probably reflects injury to the neuronal soma and dendritic arborizations, whereas WMH and FA reflect injury to axonal tracts, and both aspects of brain structure are critical to higher-order cognition, each of the MR imaging measurements has the potential to be independently associated with loss of cognitive abilities. However, it is also possible that 1 of these forms of brain injury has a greater impact on brain function and thus has the greatest biologic impact.\nIn this study, we measured GM, WMH, and FA in a diverse population of 209 community-dwelling elders and assessed their independent strengths of association with psychometrically matched measures of semantic memory, episodic memory, executive function, and spatial ability. We combined these 3 MR imaging measures into unified models to examine how strongly individual biologic substrates, as measured by MR imaging, are associated with cognitive function.",

Participants included patients with complaints of cognitive problems and cognitively normal controls. To be included in the study, participants had to be older than 60 years. Exclusion criteria were limited to unstable major medical illness, major primary psychiatric disorder (history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or recurrent major depression), and substance abuse or dependence in the last 5 years. Each of the participants signed informed consent approved by the University of California, Davis, institutional review board. The sample consisted of 209 participants.

Ninety-seven CN patients, 65 diagnosed with MCI and 47 diagnosed with dementia, were included in this study. Among the patients with dementia, 79.5 were diagnosed with probable AD, 11.4 were diagnosed with AD mixed with cerebrovascular dementia, 4.5 were diagnosed with Lewy body dementia or mixed Lewy body dementia and AD, 2.3 were diagnosed with cerebrovascular dementia, and 2.3 were diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Dementia was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th editionrevised criteria 16 for dementia, modified to exclude the requirement of memory impairment. Underlying etiology was determined according to standardized criteria and methods. MCI was diagnosed using a modified version of the Petersen criteria, which did not require cognitive complaints. 17,18 Participants were considered cognitively normal if they had no clinically significant cognitive impairment.",

Voxel size was 0.977 ϫ 0.977 ϫ 1.5 mm; WMH was determined from FLAIR imaging with TE ϭ 144 ms, TR ϭ 11,000 ms, TI ϭ 2250 ms, and a voxel size of 0.859 ϫ 0.859 ϫ 3 mm; FA was determined from DTI with TE ϭ 90.4 ms, TR ϭ 8000 ms, flip angle ϭ 90, and a voxel size of 1.875 ϫ 1.875 ϫ 5 mm. A rigorous protocol ensured the validity of the MR imaging measures across differing scanners and analysts.

The segmentation of WMH was determined from subject FLAIR images using a semiautomated approach, as described previously. 21 Briefly, nonbrain elements were manually removed from FLAIR images by operator-guided tracing of the dura mater in the cranial vault. The resulting corrected image was modeled as a mixture of 2 Gaussian probability functions, with the segmentation threshold determined at the minimum probability between these 2 distributions, followed by a single Gaussian distribution fitted to the image data using an a priori threshold of 3.5 SD in pixel intensity above the mean to identify WMH. Intrarater and interrater reliability of these methods are high and have been published previously. 24",

Global GM and WMH volumes were calculated by counting voxels within those labels throughout the brain. ICC between hand-traced brain volumes and this automatic method are greater than 0.90.\nA WM probability map in the MDT space was created by labeling the WM voxels in each T1-weighted scan, 26 transforming the resulting WM masks to MDT space, and averaging the masks across the population. Thresholding this WM average map provided a binary WM mask in MDT space.\nAn average-young-adult FA map was also created in MDT space, as previously described, 8 to provide normative FA values for comparison with the elderly participants in the present study. This map was made by transforming the FA images of 15 healthy young adults to MDT space (mean age ϭ 24.1 Ϯ 3.1 years, 60.0 male) and taking the FA average at each voxel.",

In the resulting FA ratio map, a voxel with a value lower than 1 indicates that the subject exhibits FA that is reduced compared with the young group independent of intrinsic local WM organization. Finally, after applying WM tract re-gion of interest masks 27 to each individual FA ratio map, we computed the means of FA ratio values within fornix, CC, cingulum, SLF-FP, and UNC ROIs for each subject (Fig 1).",

Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales were used to measure 4 specific domains of cognitive functioning. 28,29 A subset of Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales were combined using methods from item response theory to create composite measures: The semantic memory measure was based on object naming and picture association tests, the episodic memory measure was based on word list learning tests, and the spatial ability measure was based on pattern recognition and spatial localization tests. A composite executive function score was created from a set of fluency and working memory measures that have been previously developed using the same methods as the original Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. 28 Statistical Analyses. WMH and GM volumes were divided by intracranial volume to avoid confounding effects of head size. WMH volume was also log transformed to better approximate a normal distribution for analysis, as previously described. 19 Analyses of variance were used to detect diagnostic group differences in demographics, cognitive performance, and MR imaging measures. Tukey-Kramer adjustment was used for post hoc analyses. P values smaller than .05 were considered statistically significant. Multiple regression models were used to examine the associations between MR imaging measures and cognitive performance, while adjusting for the potential effects of sex, education, and recruitment source. Subject age was not used as a covariate in these adjusted models because previous studies indicate that controlling for age may attenuate the associations between MR imaging variables and cognitive function in this sample. 21,28 Because there were 4 outcomes, we used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and set the  level to .054. P values smaller than this  level were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed in JMP 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "MR imaging measures of GM, WMH volumes, and FA are each independently associated with cognition. 303132 However, few studies have examined whether these 3 different types of MR imaging measurements exert independent or additive effects on cognitive performance. While GM atrophy, white matter integrity, and white matter injury were each individually associated with cognitive performance in our study, only GM atrophy was associated with cognition in a multivariate model that included all 3 measures. Thus, while longitudinal measurement of the 3 brain injury measures and cognition are needed to fully understand their coevolution over time, our cross-sectional findings support the view that GM atrophy may be the most relevant MR imaging measurement of cognitive ability. We speculate that GM atrophy is more tightly tied to cognitive performance because it most specifically represents neuronal injury, and neuronal injury appears to be the most important biologic process associated with cognition.\nWe do not wish, however, to imply that injury to white matter is not important. In fact, multiple studies show that neurobehavioral deficits arise both from cortical lesions and injury to fiber tracts that link cortical and subcortical regions into distributed networks. 33 However, WMH and reduced FA represent injury to fiber tracts that is probably incomplete (ie, injured but not transected axons), thereby impeding, but not preventing, neuronal transmission via those tracts. Furthermore, because any pair of regions may be connected directly or indirectly via multiple fiber pathways, 33,34 injury to any individual pathway may alter or make inefficient, but not completely prevent, communication between functional cortical systems. Conversely, GM atrophy probably reflects injury to neuronal soma, dendrites, and, most importantly, synapses, leading to primary impairments in the nodes of the neural networks. The importance of GM atrophy in our study is further strengthened by the fact that most of the cognitively impaired participants exhibited clinical phenotypes suggesting the presence of AD pathology, which results in specific injury to pyramidal cell neurons in cortical layers III and IV responsible for cortical-cortical connectivity. 35,36 Again, these should not be interpreted as suggesting that white matter integrity has no direct bearing on late-life cognition; indeed, WMHs have been shown to impact cognitive function in the absence of severe GM atrophy, 37 and white matter injury may in fact exacerbate the gray matter atrophy that seems to drive cognitive losses. 3,8,32 However, in a population spanning a range of both GM atrophy and WM injury, our data suggest that GM atrophy may represent the final common pathway to cognitive decline. The veracity of our findings is bolstered by a number of additional observations. First, echoing previous studies, we found significant univariate associations between GM, WM measures, and cognitive performance, 30 particularly for performance in the executive and episodic memory domains. 6 In addition, we found significant differences in cognitive performance across all the cognitive domains comparing CN patients with ones with MCI and MCI with dementia, similar to prior studies. 18,38 Reductions in GM and WM across syndromes have been similarly shown. 33,39404142 We believe similarities between our study and prior observations support the primary finding of differing strengths of association between cognition and GM, WMH, and FA.\nOur study is not without limitations, however. For example, this analysis is entirely cross-sectional and therefore cannot address causality or temporal evolution. It is possible, for example, that white matter lesions may have independent effects on cognition early in the course of brain injury when clinical impairment is absent or only mild 37,43,44 but are overwhelmed in the setting of cortical brain injury through the AD process, as suggested in pathologic studies. 45 In addition, this study included participants with cognitive decline of various etiologies, though most were AD associated. This may limit our ability to investigate relations between AD-related brain injury and cognition, but the more diverse cohort would have been expected to increase the effects of WMH and FA, because many of the non-AD subjects would be expected to exhibit vascular disease. In future studies, we may restrict analysis to only patients with amnestic MCI and AD to further study the specific MR imaging changes and cognition decline associated with AD.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "These results strongly suggest that MR imaging measures of GM associate more closely with cognitive function than white matter measures do across a broad range of cognitive and functional impairment. We believe our study is among the first to comprehensively assess the relationship between various MR imaging measures of gray and white matter injury and cognitive performance. From our results, we conclude the GM injury is most important to cognitive performance among a group of older participants with various degrees of cognitive impairment. Future research will evaluate possible effects of regional differences in GM volume on longitudinal cognition and risk for transitions from normal cognitive ability to cognitive impairment.",

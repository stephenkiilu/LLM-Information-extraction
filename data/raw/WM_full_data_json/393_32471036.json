    "abstract": "Despite the severe social burden caused by Alzheimers disease (AD), no drug than can change the disease progression has been identified yet. The structural brain network research provides an opportunity to understand physiological deterioration caused by AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, persistent homology has been used to study brain network dynamics and characterize the global network organization. However, it is unclear how these parameters reflect changes in structural brain networks of patients with AD or MCI. In this study, our previously proposed persistent features and various traditional graph-theoretical measures are used to quantify the topological property of white matter (WM) network in 150 subjects with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found significant differences in these measures among AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC) under different brain parcellation schemes. The decreased network integration and increased network segregation are presented in AD and MCI. Moreover, the persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability and robustness than traditional graph-theoretic measures, suggesting that they represent a more sensitive approach to detect altered brain structures and to better understand AD symptomology at the network level. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of structural connectome in AD and provide a novel approach to potentially track the progression of AD.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) 1 is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Clinical manifestations are mainly memory dysfunction and cognitive decline. As a transitional stage between normal aging and AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases the risk of developing dementia. Understanding the physiological deterioration caused by AD and MCI provides an opportunity to develop future drugs and predict AD onset 2,3. The human brain is interconnected by a large number of neurons through synapses, forming a highly complex network system that realizes various intelligent behaviors of human beings. Within these neural networks, even minor mutations can cause serious diseases 4. In the past several years, some literatures 567 have begun to explore the treatment of AD and develop drugs from the perspective of structural brain network reconstruction and neuronal circuit repair 8. Many postmortem histological and in-vivo imaging studies indicate widespread white matter (WM) changes in patients with MCI and AD 9,10. WM brain network research provides a chance to understand how abnormal structural connections can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits in these patients.\nGraph theory 11 has become an important tool for studying the progression of AD which is characterized by network disruptions that seem to reflect the spread of pathological changes in the brain 12. Some neurobiologically meaningful topological features of graph theory have been used to measure and evaluate the integration and segregation of the brain network, including small-world attributes, hubs, modularity, etc. 13. By comparing the abnormal changes in these topological properties, the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD have been revealed to a certain extent, such as a loss of small-worldness and a redistribution of hubs 14,15. Although graph theory can find quantitative biomarkers of brain disease, it is necessary to threshold the brain network in advance 16, which will alter inferred network topologies and thus produces inconsistent results based on different thresholds 17. Moreover, there are no widely accepted criteria for choosing thresholds.\nAs a mathematical tool in algebraic topology, persistent homology 18 has been developed for the analysis of topological data, including brain networks. It establishes a multiscale brain network over all possible thresholds by graph filtration 19, and the brain networks at each scale are nested with each other, which not only provides an important framework for the analysis of the evolution of the characteristics of the brain network, but also identifies the persistent and robust structures from noise during network dynamics. Unlike the brain network studies on spatiotemporal dynamics 20,21, it only considers the intrinsic dynamics of network nodes without time delays. Using a typical persistent feature, Betti number plot (BNP) 22, some have found abnormal functional brain networks in the study of epilepsy 23, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 22,24 and others have reported disrupted structural brain networks in maltreated children 25. In our prior study 26, we proposed an integrated persistent feature (IPF) based on BNP and found that it has robust statistical capability in the study of functional brain network of AD and MCI in multiple brain atlases of different sizes. Although some persistent homology-based measures have been proposed to characterize the global organization of brain network, they have never been applied to measure the AD-related structural brain networks so far.\nIn this study, we investigate the integration and segregation of the WM brain connectome. We hypothesize that the alterations of AD progression could be understood through measuring the global structural network, and the persistent homology-based methods may provide additional insights into AD symptomology beyond studies of graph theory. We hope this study could provide a novel approach to potentially track efficacy of drug treatment for Alzheimers disease in terms of medical practice. With the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 40 AD, 77 MCI and 33 normal controls (NC), we set out to test this hypothesis by computing some standard graph-theoretic measures and our suggested persistent features for each subjects WM network and then comparing their statistical differences across the three groups to reveal AD symptomology at the network level to some extent.",

The adjacent matrices of three groups of mean weighted networks are shown in Figure 1. All edge weights were included and were ranged from 0 to 1.3 in our experiment, although theoretically they can be between 0 and 2. The lower weight represents the stronger association between ROIs. From Figure 1, there were no significant visual differences between the three groups of original networks. In order to seek their differences, we further constructed multiscale WM networks (Figure 2) from original networks using graph filtration 19 at all possible scales for studying persistent features. We found AD had more segregated connected components (sparser connections) at most filtration points before aggregating to the giant component, comparing to NC.",

Figure 3 shows the dynamic plots for the mean networks of AD, MCI, and NC groups.

    "Main Findings": {
      "text": "Our study is the first to assess how persistent homology-based features characterize the abnormal global organization in structural network of AD. We have three main findings in investigating the integration and segregation of AD-related brain networks at the global network level.\nFirst, we found abnormal integration of global network organization was presented in MCI, especially in AD, comparing to controls. The patient groups showed significantly increased CPL and reduced GE and NS using graph theory. In the brain dynamics by graph filtration based on persistent homology, the BNP and IPF indices of AD were significant different from MCI and NC (AD  MCI  NC), suggesting the altered aggregation pattern in patient groups. This finding is consistent with most of existing studies 32,33 as AD and MCI have less integration typically in whole brain organization.\nSecond, we found more highly segregated organization in MCI and AD comparing with NC, providing an evidence of AD as a disconnection syndrome 12. The patients demonstrated more separated components (larger Betti number β 0 ) in global network. This study introduces a novel perspective of persistent homology that confirms the increased segregation in AD structural networks.\nAt last, it is first time to study structural brain network of AD using persistent homology-based methods which achieved stronger power in statistical inference among three groups (p  0.01) than standard graph-theoretic measures. In our previous AD-related brain network studies on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 34 and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 26, we also exhibited the superiority of persistent homology comparing to graph theory. Taken together, persistent homology may be a more sensitive mean to detect altered brain structure and understand AD symptomology at the network level.",

    "Validation on Various Parcellations": {
      "text": "In general, the network measures are sensitive to the brain parcellation strategies 2,35. In order to evaluate the robustness of our findings, we performed identity experiments on other three parcellation schemes. Specifically, a subcortical parcellation was performed from a manually labeled training dataset 36, including eight subcortical structures (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and ventral) 37 across both hemispheres. We introduced these 16 ROIs into DK68 atlas, yielding an atlas with 84 ROIs (DK84). In addition, the widely-used automated anatomical labeling atlas with 90 regions (AAL90) 38 was severed as the second parcellation, and the last parcellation subdivided each of the regions of DK68 atlas into four sub-regions according to a parcellation division algorithm 39,40, producing an atlas with 272 regions (DK272).\nWe then computed all network indices under these three atlases and made statistical inferences on their differences across three groups. The resulting p-values are shown in Table 3. All measures except Mod, CC, and EC detected significant differences (p  0.05) between the two patient groups and the control group in three validated parcellations with increasing number of regions. In addition, GE and NS decreased with AD progression in all parcellation schemes while IPF, BNP, CPL, Mod, and EC increased, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 4. Inconsistently, the CC of patient groups decreased in AAL90 atlas, while it presented increasing trends in remaining parcellations. This conflicting result suggests that CC lacks robustness to the characterization of topological deterioration. In contrast, CPL, GE, and NS showed better robustness and sensitivity to the whole-brain parcellation schemes among graph theoretical measures. These results are consistent with existing graph-theoretic findings in 2,35,40. Moreover, only two persistent features IPF and BNP can recognize (p  0.05) or almost recognize (p  0.1) all group differences across all tested parcellations. Therefore, we could conclude that persistent features are more robust and sensitive than graph-theoretic measures to the characterization of topological deterioration in AD and MCI.",

    "Exploring Other Connectivity Definitions": {
      "text": "In addition to the connectivity definition base on fiber count that used in this study, other physiological mechanisms have been adopted to describe WM connections in DTI studies, including distinct fiber count 41, weighted distinct fiber count 41, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, and principal diffusivities (λ 1 , λ 2 , and λ 3 ), etc. 42. Among them, FA has usually been applied to define the connection between regions. We validated this physiological parameter and reconstructed WM brain networks. Then, the statistical results of different network indices between groups were obtained. As shown in Table 4, the two persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability than traditional graph-theoretic measures again. Moreover, there are various correlation methods to define interregional connectivity. Among them, Pearson correlation is a simple way to study the connection between two related variables, and is often used in the construction of brain networks, especially in the studies based on persistent homology 22,23. In this study, we used 1 minus Pearson correlation to define the edge weight, so that both positive and negative correlations can be taken into account and the lower weight (i.e., the higher association) represents the shorter path length between regions directly. Although some studies 22,23 including our prior two works 26,34 have applied this approach to connectivity definition, rare research has compared it with other different definition ways, which may yield different results in brain network analysis. For example, in order to consider the non-linearity of the brain data, Spearman correlation may represent a better approach. Then partial correlation computes the complicated relationship between two ROIs while ignores the influence of other ROIs. We validated the two common correlations and used one minus their correlation coefficients to define brain network connectivity. The statistical results are shown in Table 4, where only our previously proposed IPF obtained significant difference between the two patient groups and the control group in both connectivity definitions. In addition, some studies 43 take the absolute value of Pearson correlation instead of 1 minus Pearson correlation as edge weight. Therefore, we validated our dataset by this method and the resulting group differences are shown in Table 4. We found that the experimental results produced by these two approaches of Pearson correlation are basically indistinguishable, by comparing Tables 2 and4. Overall, our previously proposed IPF exhibited greatest robustness and sensitivity to different connectivity definitions when comparing the differences between the two patient groups and the control group, while CPL and NS detected significant differences between AD and MCI using Spearman correlation.",

    "Limitations and Future Work": {
      "text": "Despite the promising results obtained by applying our suggested persistent features to detect the abnormal structure in whole brain network organization with DTI, there are three important caveats.\nFirst, none of network measures has detected significant difference between AD and MCI under all tested parcellations and connectivity definitions in our dataset, although two persistent features IPF and BNP almost got it (both p  0.1). The clinical symptoms of patients with AD and MCI are so close that sometimes even the clinician can hardly distinguish them. In the future, we may boost the performance of persistent features to discriminate such subtle difference by applying higher dimensional persistent homologies rather than only choosing zeroth persistent homology in this study, because the higher dimensional homology can characterize the more complexed topological structures such as circular holes.\nThen, the absence of a functional MRI evaluation represents a limitation of this study because structural and functional changes in WM are not always simultaneously evident. Therefore, the change in metabolism could not be fully explained by structural WM alteration. It might be caused by functional changes, which are not evaluated in this study. Previously, we have applied persistent features to evaluate the functional changes using functional MRI 26 and FDG-PET 34 in our two independent studies. In future, we will integrate structural and functional networks together to investigate the alteration in identical subjects, making the experimental results more interpretable.\nFinally, the absence of a longitudinal DTI evaluation is another limitation of this study. We only investigated cross-sectional DTI in this study. However, the change of the longitudinal persistent feature is more meaningful, especially in tracking AD progression and assessing the effectiveness of drugs. In the future, we will investigate time-related dynamics 44 based on tract lengths and longitudinal DTI.",

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nDTI can assess the white matter structural connections within the brain, revealing how neural pathways break down in neurodegenerative diseases. We apply our algorithms to 3-Tesla whole-brain diffusion weighted images from the ADNI-2 DTI modality. All participants underwent the whole brain MRI scanning on 3T GE Medical Systems scanners. Standard anatomical T1 weighted SPGR (spoiled gradient recalled echo) sequences were collected in the same session as Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) (256  256 matrix; voxel size: 2.7  2.7  2.7 mm 3 ; TR  9000 ms; scan time  9 min). There were 46 separate images that were acquired for each diffusion MRI scan: 5 T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b 0 images) and 41 diffusion-weighted images (b  1000 smm 2 ).

    "Graph Theoretical Measures": {
      "text": "Graph theory is widely used in computer graphics and has been used to describe the topological characteristics of neural networks. The global network attributes based on graph theory characterize the ability of the overall network to transmit information 46. With the development of brain network science, many network measures have been applied to investigate integration, segregation, centrality, and other characteristics in the structural brain connectome 33,47. In this paper, the global topological properties of the WM structural brain network are analyzed using CPL 45, GE 48, EC 14, NS 41, Mod 13, and CC 49 in graph theory.\nSpecifically, CPL and GE are measures of integration. CPL is the average of the shortest paths of any two nodes in a network, and the path length between any pair of nodes is defined as the sum of the lengths of the edges along that path 45. The calculation formula is:\nwhere L i,j is the shortest path length between node i and j. Conversely, GE is the average inverse shortest path length. Further, NS of a node is defined as the sum of the edge weights connected to the node 41, indicating the strength of a nodes connection with other nodes. Here, we take the average NS over all nodes as the NS of a network. Subsequently, Mod computes the degree to which a network can be subdivided into a set of non-overlapping groups 13. Then, CC is a measure of segregation and quantifies the extent of interconnected groups in a network. The CC 49 is the average over the whole network of the fraction of a nodes neighbors that are also neighbors of each other. It is defined as:\nwhere k i is the degree of node i, and w ij is the edge weight between nodes i and j. Finally, EC is a measure of the influence of a node in a network, where the higher the assigned score to a node, the more important the node is 14. In our study, the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https:sites.google.comsitebctnet) was applied to calculate the values of the above network attributes. Before calculating these graph-based indices, each original weighted network was thresholded by only keeping the significant edges (Bonferroni corrected p  0.05) 50, so that the spurious interregional correlations were de-noised.",

    "Persistent Features": {
      "text": "Persistent homology 51,52 is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions in algebraic topology. More persistent features are detected over a wide range of length and are deemed more likely to represent true features of the underlying space, rather than artifacts of sampling, noise, or particular choice of parameters 53. The Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of k-dimensional simplicial complexes 18. Specifically, the zeroth Betti number β 0 , i.e., the zeroth persistent homology refer to the number of connected components, and a connected component in the simplicial complex is a subset of nodes any two of which are connected. From the perspective of the graph decomposition into connected components, we may obtain many possible graph filtrations. In order to determine a maximal graph filtration for quantifying β 0 of a general graph, a common approach is single linkage dendrogram (SLD) 22232425 which is equivalent to constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST) 54. Thus, we can obtain unique filtrations from the edge weight set of any MST because all possible MSTs of a graph have the identical weight set. As an example, we have two different MSTs in Figure 6b from the graph G in Figure 6a, and both have the identical weight set 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.5, thus the maximal graph filtration at five increasing filtration values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 is B(G, 0)  B(G, 0.1)  B(G, 0.2)  B(G, 0.4)  B(G, 0.5) in Figure 6c where B(G, λ i ) represents a subnetwork connected by edges with weights less than λ i , and the numbers of connected components β 0 are 6, 5, 4, 2, and 1. Finally, the Betti number β 0 plot (BNP) over all possible filtration values (Figure 6d) is regarded as a persistent feature of original network in some studies 22,24,26.\nAlthough the BNP shows how the number of connected component varies over different filtration values, it only quantifies the persistent feature in a given state, and the future required persistence information is ignored. Thus, we introduced an aggregation cost to quantify the total required persistence for completing all subsequent evolutions in a nested filtration graph and proposed a novel Integrated Persistent Feature (IPF) in our prior study 26. The IPF can be understood through the change of total required persistence in the integration process from loose connected components to a fully connected component. In a graph filtration, none of the nodes is connected at the beginning when filtration value λ is zero; the nodes are gradually connected and eventually integrate into one giant component when all nodes are connected. Suppose the total persistence when all components are connected is the target persistence, the total required persistence is getting less with the graph evolution until all components are connected. In this way, the IPF can be thought as the least total required persistence for evolving from current loose connected component to future fully connected component, because the graph filtration is produced by MST in this study. We have previously proven that the IPF plot corresponding to the maximal graph filtration is a monotonically decreasing convergence function.\n6b from the graph G in Figure 6a, and both have the identical weight set 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.5, thus the maximal graph filtration at five increasing filtration values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 is ℬ(𝐺, 0)  ℬ(𝐺, 0.1)  ℬ(𝐺, 0.2)  ℬ(𝐺, 0.4)  ℬ(𝐺, 0.5) in Figure 6c where ℬ(𝐺, 𝜆 𝑖 ) represents a subnetwork connected by edges with weights less than 𝜆 𝑖 , and the numbers of connected components 𝛽 0 are 6, 5, 4, 2, and 1. Finally, the Betti number 𝛽 0 plot (BNP) over all possible filtration values (Figure 6d) is regarded as a persistent feature of original network in some studies 22,24,26. Although the BNP shows how the number of connected component varies over different filtration values, it only quantifies the persistent feature in a given state, and the future required persistence information is ignored. Thus, we introduced an aggregation cost to quantify the total required persistence for completing all subsequent evolutions in a nested filtration graph and proposed a novel Integrated Persistent Feature (IPF) in our prior study 26. The IPF can be understood through the change of total required persistence in the integration process from loose connected components to a fully connected component. In a graph filtration, none of the nodes is connected at the beginning when filtration value λ is zero; the nodes are gradually connected and eventually integrate into one giant component when all nodes are connected. Suppose the total persistence when all components are connected is the target persistence, the total required In clinical settings, doctors prefer single indices as biomarkers because a single neuroimaging index provides a practical reference for evaluating disease progression and for effective treatments. In this study, we define the absolute slope of IPF plot as a network index (IPF index) by the linear regression analysis. The IPF is getting smaller until all connected components are connected and the IPF is equal to zero, thus the proposed IPF index may be thought as the information diffusion rate or the convergence speed of arriving to a fully connected component. Similarly, we define the absolute slope of BNP curve as BNP index. These two persistent features measure the network topology from the perspective of single persistence and total persistence during the weight dynamics. Since all possible thresholding weights are automatically and completely considered in graph filtration, they have better robustness and sensitivity than graph theoretical measures that usually quantify the network topology at a certain thresholding scale. The persistent features are automatically computed under original weighted network, without artificially specifying any threshold schemes.",

Moreover, persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability and robustness than traditionally graph-theoretic methods, suggesting it may be a more sensitive way to detect altered brain structures and to better understand AD symptomology at the network level.

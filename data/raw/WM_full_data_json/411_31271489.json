    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests the aging process is accelerated by HIV. Degradation of white matter (WM) has been independently associated with HIV and healthy aging. Thus, WM may be vulnerable to joint effects of HIV and aging. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was conducted with HIV-seropositive (n  72) and HIV-seronegative (n  34) adults. DWI data underwent tractography, which was parcellated into 18 WM tracts of interest (TOIs). Functional Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Tract Statistics (FADTTS) regression was conducted assessing the joint effect of advanced age and HIV on fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) along TOI fibers. In addition to main effects of age and HIV on WM microstructure, the interactive effect of age and HIV was significantly related to lower FA and higher MD, AD, and RD across all TOIs. The location of findings was consistent with the clinical presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Worldwide, 37 million people are currently infected with HIV (HIV).\nOf these, 5.8 (5.4-6.3) million are ages 50 years and older (Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS, 2016). As the HIV-infected population continues to age, understanding the synergistic effects of normal aging and HIV on brain microstructure is of ever-increasing importance. Prior neuroimaging studies showed HIV-associated degradation of the structural integrity of white matter (WM; Chang et al., 2008Chang et al., , 2011;;Nir et al., 2014;Seider et al., 2016;Towgood et al., 2012;Wu et al., 2006), along with associated cognitive dysfunction (Chang et al., 2011), even in patients on effective antiretroviral therapies (Kuhn et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2006). Additionally, degradation of WM fibers is an established feature of the normal aging process (Gongvatana et al., 2011;Gunning-Dixon, Brickman, Cheng,  Alexopoulos, 2009;McWhinney, Tremblay, Chevalier, Lim,  Newman, 2016;Sexton et al., 2014;Westlye et al., 2010). However, the literature disagrees on whether there is an interactive relationship between HIV infection and aging in cognitively unimpaired patients (Holt, Kraft-Terry,  Chang, 2012). Some scientists contend that there is no interactive or synergistic effect of HIV and aging on the brain (Cole et al., 2018;Valcour et al., 2004a), whereas others contend that HIV infection accelerates brain aging (Kuhn et al., 2016;Morgan, Lee,  Nyagode, 2011;Sacktor et al., 2010;Vance, McGuinness, Musgrove, Orel,  Fazeli, 2011). We suggest here that the previous inability to detect significant AgeHIV interactive effects in WM microstructure may be due to methodological differences (including neuroimage processing, statistical analysis, and sample size) rather than the lack of an AgeHIV interaction. Additionally, inconsistent reports may relate to biological differences across samples, including discrepancies in the degree of cognitive impairment and duration of infection. In fact, there is such variability in published diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in HIV that this phenomenon has been studied and attributed, in part, to cohort selection (OConnor, Jaillard, Renard,  Zeffiro, 2017). Therefore, the present study focused exclusively on cognitively unimpaired HIV participants.\nIn a cross-sectional DTI study, lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) were found pervasively throughout the entire WM, and most notably in the corpus callosum, superior corona radiata, and external capsule in a sample of older HIV participants compared to controls (Nir et al., 2014). A 1-year longitudinal study of cognitively unimpaired HIV participants showed higher diffusivity in the genu of the corpus callosum relative to baseline compared to controls. Further, the HIV group showed, on average, significantly higher MD changes in the frontal and parietal WM, putamen, and genu compared to baseline measures (Chang et al., 2008). However, these authors did not detect an interactive effect of HIV infection and age on WM. These authors also reported independent effects of age on FA, AD, RD, and MD throughout the brain. Again, this study did not find a significant interaction between HIV and age on WM microstructure, although this may be due in part to the restricted, older age range of the studied cohort and the available sample size (i.e., 39 HIV participants).\nConversely, one recent study did report an interactive effect of HIV and age on both WM hyperintensities and FA in an HIV sample (n  88) that remained when evaluating a subsample (n  43) without Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and detectable HIV RNA (Seider et al., 2016). Similarly, some magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies reported significant AgeHIV interactive effects, particularly for neurometabolites in the frontal WM (Cysique et al., 2013;Ernst  Chang, 2004;Harezlak et al., 2011). Therefore, there may be an interactive, or simply additive, effect of the HIV disease process and aging on brain structure. Although no studies to our knowledge have reported an interaction of HIV infection and age on WM microstructure in larger, solely monoinfected (i.e., no HCV) HIV cohorts, possibly due to cohort effects andor insufficient spatial sensitivity of the analytic methods employed, recent machine learning studies have demonstrated an augmented or accentuated aging process in gray and WM volume (Cole et al., 2018;Cole, Caan, et al., 2018) and WM microstructure (Kuhn et al., 2018) with associated cognitive deficits.\nOne technique that can address such limitations from prior studies associated with insufficient spatial sensitivity of analytic methods is automated Multi-Atlas Tract Extraction procedure (autoMATE Jin et al., 2017), which is a highly spatially sensitive 3D tractography technique that allows for the investigation of WM microstructure along individual WM tracts (Jin et al., 2014(Jin et al., , 2017)). This method has previously been used to highlight the spatial distribution of neurodegenerative effects related to Alzheimers disease (Jin, Shi, Zhan,  Thompson, 2015) and frontotemporal dementia (Daianu et al., 2016).\nWhile some prior HIV studies used voxel-wise analyses to investigate effects of HIV and age on WM (Chang et al., 2011;Nir et al., 2014;Seider et al., 2016), these analyses yield results along a single central line assumed to represent the entirety of a WM tract. Conversely, by using deterministic tractography to compute large-scale, multiple-fiber representations of WM tracts, autoMATE can better localize effects to specific regions of tracts, providing information on regionally specific changes in WM. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have used this 3D tractography technique to investigate changes related to disease or age in HIV (Jin et al., 2014). Thus, we examined the effects of HIV infection, age, and the interaction between HIV and age on WM microstructure along the length of fibers comprising several robustly identifiable WM tracts. Further, a past review suggested that aging effects in HIV may be limited to individuals with severe cognitive impairment (OConnor et al., 2017); therefore, to limit this possible confound, we recruited a cognitively unimpaired sample with a wide age range (HIV: 24-76 years; HIV-: 21-66 years), along with well-matched controls.",

All participants provided written informed consent. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV; First, Spitzer, Gibbon,  Williams, 1997) and questionnaires about neurological and other medical history were used to screen for neurological, psychiatric, and medical confounds, including: history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disorder; history of concussion or traumatic brain injury sufficient to warrant medical attention; history of Axis I psychiatric disorder or substance use disorder (SCID-IV diagnostic criteria); current prescription for psychotropic medication, except for anxiolytics and antidepressants; current substance use disorder or methamphetamine use; past opioid or stimulant use disorder; comorbid central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., HCV); and HIVassociated CNS opportunistic infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis) or neoplasm. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation involving empirical assessment of domain-level and global cognition was performed to ensure all participants were cognitively unimpaired. Cognitive impairment was operationalized as performance 1.0 standard deviations or more below the mean, based on published normative data, in two cognitive domains (Antinori et al., 2007). Participants were also screened for MRI contraindications.",

      "text": "The diffusion MRI data for each subject was first corrected for geometric distortion due to B0 inhomogeneity using the INVERSION (Bhushan et al., 2015) method implemented in BrainSuite version 16a (http:brainsuite.org). This process performs a constrained nonrigid registration between the subjects T1-weighted MRI and diffusion MRI data. The diffusion MRI data were then resampled to the coordinate space of the T1-weighted MRI using the estimated deformation field. Prior to distortion correction, each T1-weighted MRI was skullstripped and corrected for nonuniformity using BSE and BFC, respectively (Shattuck, Sandor-Leahy, Schaper, Rottenberg,  Leahy, 2001); skull-stripping masks were manually corrected for four participants.\nFollowing a routine DWI processing pipeline carried out using FSL version 6.0 (Smith et al., 2004) involving brain extraction, correction for motion and eddy current distortion, and tensor-fitting, whole-brain tractography was conducted using Camino (http:cmic.cs.ucl.ac. ukcamino). We then performed autoMATE (Jin et al., 2017) to parcellate and cluster 18 WM tracts of interest (TOIs) based on the Johns Hopkins University White Matter Atlas (Mori et al., 2008). auto-MATE involves a harmonized, multi-atlas anatomical labelling approach that has been shown to outperform alternative single-atlas approaches (Doshi et al., 2016;Erus et al., 2018). Eighteen fiber TOIs were extracted from a previously constructed WM atlas (Mori et al., 2008). From each TOI, five manually labeled tracts were made based on tractography results from five healthy participants to create accurate models of these tracts in vivo. These manually labeled tracts were then warped to each subjects whole-brain tractography. For group-wise analyses, a fiber-matching scheme was used to register the tracts across the participant population (Westlye et al., 2010). The registered WM tracts resulted in data for each fiber in each tract in the same location for each participant. Each fiber was then segmented into 25 equidistant sections onto which FA, MD, RD, and AD values were interpolated and used for statistical analysis. For a thorough review of these methods, please see Jin et al. (2017). Diffusion metrics were then statistically interrogated at each of the 25 points along every fiber within each tract using Functional Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Tract Statistics (FADTTS; Zhu et al., 2011). To demonstrate the spatial specificity of our results, Figures 123 While routine linear regression could be used to statistically interrogate this data, we chose to use an alternative approach that is optimized for statistics conducted on data with a spatial component.\nFADTTS regressions are similar to traditional regressions with a primary and important distinction that makes them well suited for DTI analysis: FADTTS regressions do not treat each data point (i.e., each point along a WM tract) as an independent observation. Instead, FADTTS regressions assume there is some shared variance among neighboring data points, taking into account smoothness and spatial correlation between the neighboring points along each fiber and treating diffusion parameters as functions of their fiber locations. By acknowledging this dependence, or covariance, among neighboring points, these data points are treated as nonindependent, subsequently increasing statistical power. As such, FADTTS regressions may outperform traditional GLM analyses. Therefore, FADTTS regressions were applied to assess the independent (i.e., age and HIV-serostatus) and joint (interaction) effects of advanced age and HIV infection on FA, AD, RD, and MD at each point within each TOI fiber. This approach resulted in a unique analysis for each TOI.\nThe FADTTS regression treated each TOI as an independent region orthogonal to each other TOI. Thus, no correlation between TOIs was considered in the model. Within each TOI, each fiber was also treated as orthogonal to every other fiber within that region of interest. Therefore, no between-fiber correlations were included in the model. Conversely, within each fiber within each TOI, correlations were modeled between each of the 25 segments of individual fibers that were statistically interrogated. This intrafiber correlation was addressed in the FADTTS model using a stochastic variable that accounted for the covariance between the variables of interest F I G U R E 1 Depicting effect of advancing age on the CC (1), bilateral FRX (2), bilateral ATR (3), ILF (4), left ARC (5), and IFO (6) lower fractional anisotropy (a), and higher mean (b), axial (c), and radial diffusivity (d).

Sex, ethnicity, education (years), and participant self-reported nadir CD4 count and highest lifetime HIV viral load were included in the model as covariates. To remove effects of multicollinearity, the main effects of age and HIV status were controlled for when assessing the interactive effect of age and HIV serostatus. All statistical analyses, including within fibers, across fibers, and across TOIs, were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (Benjamini  Hochberg, 1995;Schwartzman, Dougherty, Lee, Ghahremani,  Taylor, 2009), with statistical significance denoted as the P-value threshold adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons (FDR at 5 q  0.05). The percentages of fiber points that yielded significant results for each statistical analysis are presented in Tables 2-4 to help elucidate the spatial extent of the significant findings. For the tables as well as Figures 123, a percentage of the significant results of each variable of interest (e.g., main effect of age and interaction effect of AgeHIV) on each TOI was computed as: Number of points within the TOI where a significant effect was found Ä Total number of points within that TOI.",

      "text": "A significant main effect of age on WM was found, indicating that as age increased, there were significant FA decreases and MD, AD, and RD increases in all TOIs investigated (Table 2), all of which typically reflect poorer or more impacted WM microstructure. This effect of advancing age on WM microstructure was most pronounced in the CC-FRN, body and fimbria of the FNX, bilateral ATR fibers projecting to the frontal lobe, temporal portions of the ILF, language-dominant cortical projections from the ARC, and primarily frontal cortex projections from bilateral IFO (Figure 1).\nSignificant main effects of HIV serostatus were also found in all TOIs. Regions with reduced FA associated with HIV infection were found in the left ARC, left ATR, left CC-OCC, left IFO, and left ILF, as well as increased RD in the bilateral ATR, right CST, CC-FRN, right CGC, right IFO, and right ILF. However, the control group had significantly lower FA and higher diffusivity metrics in portions of all TOIs investigated compared to the HIV group (Table 3). These findings were more prominent across larger regions of TOIs and included the CC-TEM, CC-PAR, internal capsule and distal CST fibers, retrosplenial CGC, posterior ARC fibers, and medial regions of both ILF and IFO.\nRegarding our key analysis pertaining to the joint effects of age and HIV on WM, measures of WM microstructure (i.e., FA, MD, RD, and AD) showed significant interactive effects of age and HIV status (q  0.05). Specifically, the interaction effect revealed that measures that typically reflect poorer or more impacted WM microstructure (i.e., lower FA and higher MD, RD, and AD) were related to older age, and this effect was greater in HIV participants relative to HIV-participants. The interactive effect of HIV and advancing age was significantly related to lower FA, higher MD, higher AD, and higher RD across the regions of the CC, FNX, left AF, and bilateral ATR, CST, ILF, IFOF, and CB. When ranking TOIs based on the severity of the FA decrease with age, the interactive effect was most pronounced in the bilateral internal capsule (within the CST) and CC, particularly CC-TEM and CC-PAR (Figure 3). Interestingly, when ranking TOIs based on the severity of the AD increase with age, the interactive effect was strongest in the CC-TEM, the ARC fibers nearest language-involved cortex, posterior CGC regions, primarily temporal portions of bilateral ILF, internal capsule, portions of bilateral CST, and primarily frontal cortex projections from the right IFO.\nTable 4 reports the percentage of points within each TOI where the interaction of HIV and age was significantly associated with DTI F I G U R E 3 Depicting interactive effect of HIV infection and advancing age on the CC (1), bilateral CST (2), left ARC (3), bilateral CGC (4), ILF (5), and IFO (6) lower fractional anisotropy (a), and higher mean (b), axial (c), and radial diffusivity (d).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study examined the independent and interactive effects of age and HIV serostatus on microstructural measures from the major WM fiber bundles by using an automated clustering 3D tractography technique (autoMATE Jin et al., 2017). This neuroimaging analysis method offers a more localized measurement of 3D profiles of WM tracts than analyses conducted using a global metric of mean WM microstructure.\nAlthough the presence of a significant AgeHIV interaction effect limits the interpretability of significant main effects, age and HIV infection were both found to independently relate to WM deterioration. As anticipated, significant effects of advancing age on WM microstructure were found, indicating that as age progresses, WM microstructure evidences deleterious changes. These findings are in line with a large extant literature (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018;Gongvatana et al., 2011;Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009;McWhinney et al., 2016;Sexton et al., 2014;Westlye et al., 2010) and are congruent with the neuropsychological changes associated with advanced aging (Pomara, Crandall, Choi, Johnson,  Lim, 2001;Summers  Bondi, 2017). Similarly, as expected and consistent with a larger literature (e.g., (Chang et al., 2011;Filippi, Ulu g, Ryan, Ferrando  van Gorp, 2001;Pomara et al., 2001;Seider et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2011;Wright, Heaps, Shimony, Thomas  Ances, 2012)), a significant main effect of HIV was found on WM. However, some TOIs evidenced WM deterioration that was greater in the seronegative control group, which may be explained by the heterogeneous nature of the cellular effect of HIV infection on WM. However, these simple main effects of age and HIV serostatus must be interpreted in light of an interaction effect. Specifically, when controlling for several potentially confounding factors (i.e., sex, ethnicity, education years, nadir CD4 count, and highest lifetime HIV viral load), our key analyses revealed significant AgeHIV interactive effects in all TOIs. These results indicate that in addition to older age being related to poorer WM microstructural integrity, the detrimental effect of aging on WM is significantly stronger among HIV individuals relative to HIV-individuals. In several TOIs, including the CC, ILF, IFO, and ATR, interactive effects were strongest in fibers projecting to the Values represent percent of entire tract where main effect of age was statistically significant after multiple comparison correction (FDR; q  0.05). TOIs investigated: the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), bilateral corticospinal tract (CST), bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFO), bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), fornix (FNX), bilateral cingulate bundle (CGC), left arcuate fasciculus (ARC), and corpus callosum (CC) fibers projecting to postcentral gyrus (CC-POC), precentral gyrus (CC-PRC), frontal lobe (CC-FRN), parietal lobe (CC-PAR), temporal lobe (CC-TEM), and occipital lobe (CC-OCC).\nfrontal and temporal lobes, consistent with knowledge of a relatively heterogeneous yet typically predominantly frontal-subcortical involvement in HIV (Ettenhofer  Abeles, 2009;Gullett et al., 2018;Heaton et al., 2010;Hinkin, Castellon, Atkinson,  Goodkin, 2001;Price, Bartlett,  Bloom, 2016;Valcour et al., 2004a;Valcour, Sithinamsuwan, Letendre,  Ances, 2011). These findings are also consistent with MRS studies that reported significant AgeHIV interactive effects, particularly for frontal WM metabolites (Cysique et al., 2013;Ernst  Chang, 2004;Harezlak et al., 2011); AgeHIV interactive effects were also reported in subcortical regions (Kuhn et al., 2018). Together, these findings both support and expand upon prior literature demonstrating jointly deleterious effects of HIV and aging on WM microstructure (Gullett et al., 2018;Holt et al., 2012;Nir et al., 2014;Towgood et al., 2012).\nImportantly, prior failures to detect AgeHIV interactive effects on WM microstructure may not mean they are not in fact present.\nRegional mean diffusion metric measurements only allow for inference about WM microstructure across entire WM tracts, and prior DTI studies typically investigated mean-level diffusion metrics acquired from large WM tracts or WM regions of interest. As HIVassociated neurologic damage can occur well before overt cognitive manifestations emerge (as has been demonstrated in healthily-aging individuals prior to converting to mild cognitive impairment MCI (Whitwell et al., 2007), as well as MCI prior to conversion to Alzheimers disease (Ciarmiello et al., 2006), Parkinsons disease (Whitwell et al., 2007), and Huntingtons disease (Horvath  Levine, 2015)), and as the pattern of HIV-related neuronal loss is not uniform, computing diffusivity metrics for a particular WM tract may be suboptimal for capturing early changes. Therefore, coupled with the current findings, prior failures to detect interactive effects may indeed be related to cohort effects (OConnor et al., 2017) and insufficient spatial sensitivity of the analytic methods used. autoMATE analyses allow for inferences about different mechanisms of WM microstructure insult that are highly spatially specific and suggest different forms of pathologic neuronal changes. Some of these WM alterations (discussed below) may account for part of the heterogeneity of cognitive impairments seen in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, and future investigations should focus their efforts on elucidating the neurocognitive associations with these regional WM effects. It may similarly be meaningful for future investigations to assess the effect of treatment history, including such variables as treatment initiated in the pre-versus post-HAART era as well as types of antiretroviral medications and their CNS penetrance effectiveness, on the effect of HIV and aging on WM integrity.\nFurther, these findings are in line with recent machine learning studies (Cole, Caan, et al., 2018;Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018;Kuhn et al., 2018) brain tissue in HIV participants (Nir et al., 2014). This accelerated aging process was hypothesized to occur via similar cellular mechanisms to those of neural aging (Jin et al., 2017). Thus, some of the pathology driving our findings may reflect an acceleration of otherwise normal, age-related processes (in line with our findings and those from the prior literature (Cole, Ritchie, et al., 2018;Gongvatana et al., 2011;Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009;McWhinney et al., 2016;Sexton et al., 2014;Westlye et al., 2010)). Such age-related mechanisms may include increased microglial proliferation with age (Von Bernhardi, Tichauer,  Eugenín, 2010), altered neuroprotective and inflammatory functions of microglia (Kipnis et al., 2004;Rogers et al., 2013), and inflammation-related (e.g., CD4 T lymphocyte) neurogenesis within healthy tissue (Kipnis et al., 2004;Nakanishi  Wu, 2009;Ziv et al., 2006;Wolf et al., 2009); for a detailed review, see Schwartz, Kipnis, Rivest, and Prat (2013).\nThe current study has some limitations that should be noted. Generalizability to other ethnic groups and women is limited due to a relatively small sample consisting primarily of African-American and Caucasian males. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study, we are unable to make inferences regarding long-term outcomes or the rates of changes in WM microstructure in HIV individuals. Further, the average age of our HIV cohort was approximately 50 years, which could be considered relatively young for studies of aging (Rickabaugh et al., 2015). Even so, although cohort effects have clearly resulted in varied results throughout the literature, our cohort age range was wide, including HIV participants from 24 to 76 years old and HIV-participants ages 21-66 years old, and all participants were cognitively unimpaired. As recent studies suggest that HIV infection is associated with accelerated biological aging (Hua, Schindler, McQuail, Forbes,  Riddle, 2012)",

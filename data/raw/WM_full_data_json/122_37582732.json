    "abstract": "Background It is known that blood levels of neurofilament light (NF-L) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) are both associated with outcome of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Here, we sought to examine the association between admission levels of plasma NF-L and white matter (WM) integrity in postacute stage DW-MRI in patients with mTBI. Methods Ninety-three patients with mTBI (GCS  13), blood sample for NF-L within 24 h of admission, and DW-MRI  90 days post-injury (median  229) were included. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated from the skeletonized WM tracts of the whole brain. Outcome was assessed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at the time of imaging. Patients were divided into CT-positive and -negative, and complete (GOSE  8) and incomplete recovery (GOSE  8) groups. Results The levels of NF-L and FA correlated negatively in the whole cohort (p  0.002), in CT-positive patients (p  0.016), and in those with incomplete recovery (p  0.005). The same groups showed a positive correlation with mean MD, AD, and RD (p  0.001-p  0.011). In CT-negative patients or in patients with full recovery, significant correlations were not found. Conclusion In patients with mTBI, the significant correlation between NF-L levels at admission and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) over more than 3 months suggests that the early levels of plasma NF-L may associate with the presence of DAI at a later phase of TBI.",

      "text": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), which includes concussion, accounts for 80 -90 of all TBIs presenting to emergency departments 1. At a cellular level, the pathophysiology of mTBI consists primarily of diffuse injury caused by stretching and tearing of the brain tissue, followed by a complex cascade of neurometabolic changes 2345. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the main form of diffuse injury, and results from acceleration  deceleration forces leading to axonal shearing 6,7. Computed tomography (CT), the most commonly used imaging method for acute TBI, is generally unable to detect DAI 8,9. Also, conventional MRI is poor in showing or quantifying DAI, and neuropathological examination is the only accurate method for diagnosing DAI at the moment 7,10,11. Advanced neuroimaging methods, such as diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, have been shown to be sensitive enough to detect small abnormalities associated with DAI 121314. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 15,16 is a technique to evaluate DAI in patients with mTBI in the subacute and chronic phases 15,17181920, but is still considered mainly as a research tool. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been the main focus in DTI studies after an mTBI 20. DW-MRI based structural connectivity after mTBI has been recently shown to be related to outcome 21.\nRegrettably, biomarkers to assess the degree of axonal injury or the multidimensional pathophysiological events following mTBI are not yet available for clinical use 222324. Neurofilament light (NF-L) protein is an axonal biomarker that can be measured in blood samples with ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) technology 252627. NF-L is mainly expressed in the long myelinated WM axons 2,27,28. A significant association between DTI measures of DAI and the serum levels of NF-L following severe TBI (sTBI) has been reported, suggesting that the levels of NF-L may reflect the degree of axonal injury 27,29. Elevated levels of plasma NF-L in mTBI have been found in contact sports athletes, although those studies did not report the correlation between the levels of NF-L and WM integrity 5,30. Recently, a significant association between the early plasma levels of NF-L and the outcome in patients with mTBI has been reported in a prospectively collected well-characterized cohort by our research group 31, which supports the concept that NF-L is a potential blood biomarker to explore the complex pathophysiology of axonal injury following mTBI. A recent study by Shahim et al. examined the time course and diagnostic utility of NF-L in subacute and chronic TBI, demonstrating that increased serum concentrations of NF-L at enrolment correlated with the DTI measures of DAI 32. Another multicenter prospective study also reported that the levels of plasma NF-L reflect the WM damage following TBI 33. A recent pilot study on the adolescent soccer players also reported a significant association between DTI metrics and proteomic blood biomarkers, including NF-L 34.\nSince it is known that blood levels of NF-L and DW-MRI are both associated with outcome of patients with mTBI, we sought to investigate the possible association between the admission levels of plasma NF-L and WM integrity, measured using post-acute DTI metrics. The hypothesis of this study is that acute level of plasma NF-L following mTBI may help clinicians better stratify those patients who require further DTI imaging to understand acquired axonal injury.",

From November 2011 to October 2013, 93 patients with mTBI Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)  13 and a control group of 21patients with orthopedic injury (OI) were recruited, with blood samples available within 24 h from the arrival to the emergency department (ED) of the Turku University Hospital, Finland.\nThe inclusion criteria for patients with mTBI were: lowest GCS  13, age  18 years, clinical diagnosis of TBI, and indications for acute head CT according to NICE criteria (http: www. nice. org. uk guida nce cg176). The exclusion criteria were: age  18 years, blast-induced or penetrating injury, chronic subdural hematoma, inability to live independently due to pre-existing brain disease, admission more than 2 weeks from the injury, not living in the district (thereby preventing follow-up visits), not speaking native language, or no consent received.\nThe inclusion criteria for patients with OI were: age  18 years, acute nontrivial OI, no concomitant TBI, and no CNS involvement. The exclusion criteria were: any suspicion of concomitant acute TBI, history of any brain disease or TBI, need for admission to intensive care due to polytrauma, or trivial injuries with no necessity for emergency measures or follow-up.",

      "text": "Although majority of the samples were obtained within 24 h of admission, they were not always drawn within 24 h after injury. All samples were kept in cold ice and processed within 1 h and stored at -80 C until analysis. At the day of the measurements, samples are thawed and kept on ice until diluted into sample diluent according to the protocol provided in the kit insert. NF-L is a stable analyte that is not sensitive to storage temperature or repeated freezing-thawing 35. Plasma NF-L levels were measured using the Human Neurology 4-Plex A assay on an HD-1 Simoa instrument according to instructions from the manufacturer (Quanterix, Billerica, MA). The measurements were performed in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical data. Quality control (QC) samples were analyzed in each run, with coefficients of variations of 4.4 at 13.9 pgmL and 6.1 at 7.1 pgmL for NF-L. The lower limit of detection (LLoD) and the lower limit of quantification (LloQ) for NF-L were 0.104 pgmL and 0.241 pgmL, respectively and a calibration range between 0.533 pgmL and 453.0 pgmL.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This prospective, observational study of patients with mTBI investigated the association between the admission levels of plasma NF-L with WM integrity, measured using DTI metrics from DW-MR images more than 3 months from the injury. Moreover, we also compared the admission levels of NF-L between the patients with mTBI and the OI control group. The main findings were as follows: (1) Significant negative correlations between the levels of NF-L and FA and significant positive correlations between the levels of NF-L and the other diffusivity measures were observed in the whole mTBI cohort, in patients with CT-positive findings, and in patients with incomplete recovery. (2) The admission levels of NF-L were significantly higher in the whole mTBI cohort, in patients with CT-positive findings, and in patients with incomplete recovery, compared to the control group. (3) Lower anisotropy and higher diffusivity measures were observed in CT-positive patients compared with patients without any CT findings. (4) Admission levels of NF-L were higher in CT-positive patients and in patients with incomplete recovery compared with CT-negative patients and patients with complete recovery respectively. NF-L protein has been extensively studied as a potential body fluid biomarker to investigate the ongoing axonal injury following TBI 33,34,57. Several studies have shown that patients with mTBI or concussion had significantly higher levels of NF-L compared to healthy individuals or orthopedic controls, not only in the acute phase following the injury, but also in the subacute and chronic phases 32,434445. After TBI, a significant increase in serum levels of NF-L has been observed, which persisted up to 10 -12 days after injury 46. In addition, the admission levels, as well as the levels at several timepoints, were correlated with the outcome of TBI 46. The levels of NF-L have been shown to be significantly elevated in contact sports athletes, for example, professional hockey players who suffered from symptoms after repetitive mTBI 5,44. It has also been reported that a single mild to moderate TBI may cause long-term neuroaxonal degeneration, which could be detected by NF-L as a surrogate marker 32. Of note, our research group lately reported that the levels of NF-L were able to differentiate patients with complete recovery from incomplete recovery, and favorable outcome from unfavorable outcome after mTBI. These results applied not only to the whole cohort, but also to patients with CT-positive mTBI, and the early levels of NF-L strongly correlated with outcome 31. Recent studies utilizing the admission and late samples reported that serum levels of NF-L were longitudinally associated with DTI estimates of DAI 32. Lower anisotropy and higher diffusivity measures may suggest compromised axonal integrity, demyelination, Wallerian degeneration and overall, might be an indication of axonal degeneration following mTBI 474849. These findings are in accordance with previous studies in patients with TBI 50515253. It has been reported that the elevated blood levels of NF-L at 6 months was significantly related to the metrics of microstructural injury on DTI 54. A recent multicenter prospective study of advanced fluid and imaging markers of axonal injury after moderate to severe TBI, BIO-AX-TBI 55, demonstrated that the levels of plasma NF-L and DTI metrics are closely related in quantifying underlying axonal injury subacutely after TBI. In this study, microdialysate taken directly from damaged WM was found to contain very high levels of NF-L and this concentration of NF-L in microdialysis fluid significantly correlated with the levels of NF-L in plasma. Moreover, in the same study, the plasma levels of NF-L also correlated with histopathologically defined axonal injury within the WM, which was produced by an experimental injury model 33. Thus, the association between the plasma levels of NF-L and DTI metrics indicates that plasma NF-L measurement may reflect the damage of WM of the brain following TBI. The results of the present study are thus consistent with the aforementioned studies.\nThe kinetics of NF-L as a blood biomarker has been recently explored by using several time points of sampling following TBI. These studies found that the peak of NF-L is between 10 days and 6 weeks following injury and that subacute levels strongly correlated with outcome 33,56. These results are in agreement with the concept that DAI is a slow, long-lasting process, as suggested by longitudinal imaging studies 5758596061. In the current study, only admission samples were used, since few patients with mTBI had samples available from later days. The observed correlation between the admission levels of NF-L and DTI metrics probably reflects the consequences of rapid regional axonal damage in those who show visible traumatic lesions, rather than reflecting the many secondary pathophysiological cascades contributing to subsequently evolving WM damage. This is supported by the fact that in CT-negative patients, significant correlations were not seen.\nA well-characterized, prospectively collected study population is a major strength of the study, but there are also limitations that need to be acknowledged. Although NF-L does not have sources outside the nervous system, it is known that trauma itself has at least indirect consequences on the brain. Thus, patients with orthopedic injuries were analyzed as controls in order to increase the reliability of the results. Besides the small sample size and a single-center study, other key limitations of this study are the timing of NF-L not being tight, the lack of data for NF-L levels at later timepoints after admission, and lack of DTI data at several time points to conduct longitudinal analyses. Given that NF-L is a slow marker 62, i.e., the peak in blood comes days-weeks after injury, and that one-time DTI measures are unable to describe the temporal evolution of DAI 63, this study is unable to shed light on the progression of such axonal injury. The main practical limitation, thus, is that this study is unable to show if NF-L at a later timepoint could predict incomplete recovery in patients who are CT-negative after an mTBI.\nFor the critical interpretation of the study findings, it is also evident that the results were driven by patients with more severe injuries -especially those who had mass lesions or multiple contusions. To partially address this, CT-positive and CT-negative findings were analyzed separately, and significant findings were found only in the CT-positive subgroup. For the CT-negative subjects there was no significant correlation between the levels of NF-L and any of the diffusion metrics in either the complete or incomplete recovery subgroups. This suggests that the correlations observed in the incomplete recovery group, including both the CT-positive and the CT-negative, have been heavily influenced by the CT-positive group.\nIndeed, the severity of injury in our mTBI cohort was worse than in an average mTBI population typically seen in the ED, therefore it cannot be considered to represent cases with mTBI in general. It is important to know that we classified the patients to severity groups solely based on the admission GCS score. Classifying the severity of TBI using the lowest recorded GCS is one of the important limitations of this study. In our series, the mildest cases of mTBI were often discharged before the possibility to recruit and a relatively large percentage of our mTBI cohort showed traumatic intracranial CT abnormalities, consequently requiring hospital admission. Furthermore, even though all the recruited patients had GCS  13, categorized as mTBI, some patients had PTA for  24 h post injury, which is an indication of higher severity of TBI according to several classifications. PTA was assessed retrospectively using the Rivermead method 64 at the outcome visit, whereas prospective evaluation is often considered to have higher reliability. Further analysis on patients with mTBI, also considering PTA, found that there was no significant correlation between the levels of NF-L and any of the diffusion metrics, irrespective of CT results. This shows that the significant results found are strongly driven by the cases at the severe end. Even though the variability of the GOSE assessment is another limitation, the same experienced blinded neurologist performed the assessments of all patients. These issues have been elaborated thoroughly in our previous publications. Functional outcome is much more complex than just complete or incomplete recovery as assessed with the GOSE and clinicians assessment of disability also vary and may be different from those of their patients 65.\nDue to the logistics and the limited availability to scan patients, it was not possible to scan all subjects within a certain window of time after injury hence the difference in time from injury to imaging could be a limitation of this study. Acquisition of DW-MR images with a single shell and only one b0 is another shortcoming in this study. Acquiring multi-shell DW-MR data with several b0 images using advanced analysis approaches, such as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging 66, or using novel deep learning approaches suitable for single-shell DW-MRI 67, might reveal signs of axonal injury not detectable in the current study. Furthermore, TBSS suffers from inherent limitations such as the inability to correctly differentiate complex WM fiber configurations and being susceptible to partial volume effects 68.",

    "Conclusion": {
      "text": "The significant correlation between NF-L levels at admission and DTI measurements of DAI over more than 3 months suggests that plasma NF-L may associate with the presence of DAI during the acute phase of TBI and possibly help clinicians to recognize those patients who need more careful follow-up. This needs to be validated using several time-points of biomarker sampling, longitudinal DTI data, and larger cohorts. Large multicenter studies with adequate control groups, including patients with polytrauma as well as healthy controls, should be conducted before blood biomarker research findings can be translated into clinical practice. Moreover, future research should establish standard methods for quantification on different analytical platforms and define cut-off values for these blood biomarkers across different injury subtypes and age groups 575859.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a robust and early sign for Parkinsons disease (PD). Previous studies have revealed its association with dementia and related neural changes in PD. Yet, how olfactory dysfunction affects white matter (WM) microstructure in newly diagnosed and untreated PD remains unclear. Here we comprehensively examined WM features using unbiased whole-brain analyses. 88 newly diagnosed PD patients without dementia (70 with hyposmia and 18 without hyposmia) and 33 healthy controls underwent clinical assessment and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning. Tract-based special statistics (TBSS), graph-theoretic methods and network-based statistics (NBS) were used to compare regional and network-related WM features between groups. TBSS analysis did not show any differences in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity between groups. Compared with controls, PD patients without hyposmia showed a significant decrease in global efficiency, whilst PD patients with hyposmia exhibited significantly reduced global and local efficiency and additionally a disrupted connection between the right medial orbitofrontal cortex and left rectus and had poorer frontal-related cognitive functioning. These results demonstrate that hyposmia-related WM changes in early PD only occur at the network level. The confined disconnectivity between the bilateral olfactory circuitry may serve as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction in early PD.",

      "text": "Mounting evidence has suggested that olfactory dysfunction is an early and consistent non-motor symptom in Parkinsons disease (PD), affecting 4590 of PD patients 1 . Diminished olfactory function may precede the onset of the classic motor symptoms in PD 234 , thereby being considered as a useful marker for early detection of PD. Patients with PD and hyposmia (hypos-PD) are prone to cognitive impairment 5,6 , cardiovascular dysautonomia 7,8 , and even dementia 9 . Understanding the neural substrates of olfactory dysfunction in PD is therefore of great clinical significance.\nPrevious single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that olfactory dysfunction in PD is associated with altered metabolic activities in the limbic (e.g., the amygdala and hippocampus), occipital, and striatal areas 2,5,910111213 . In addition, functional MRI studies also indicate the presence of altered neural activity underlying olfactory dysfunction in PD. Specifically, patients with hypos-PD showed reduced activation in the bilateral rectus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala and parahippocampus and reduced functional connectivities between the left rectus and prefrontal, temporal, occipital, and limbic areas, compared with healthy controls (HCs) 14 . Structural MRI studies using region-of-interest (ROI) methods have unraveled the neuroanatomical basis of the metabolic and functional changes and have found that olfactory-related atrophy occurred not only in the primary olfactory cortex (e.g., the piriform and amygdala), but also extended to the OFC, temporal, parietal-occipital, and cingulate cortex in PD 9,151617 .\nFew studies have addressed the white matter (WM) correlates of olfactory dysfunction in PD. The work by Ibarretxe-Bilbao et al. employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to examine some pre-defined ROIs and discovered diminished WM integrity in the rectus and primary olfactory cortex of PD patients with severe olfactory dysfunction, when compared with PD patients without hyposmia (norms-PD) and HCs 18 . Olfactory performance was also found to be associated with WM features of the cerebellum 19 , but not the substantia nigra 20 .\nMost previous DTI studies on PD-related hyposmia examined only a few pre-selected brain regions 18,20,21 or did not differentiate between hyposmic and normosic patients 1920212223 . To date, there are no known studies examining the whole-brain WM network alterations that underlie olfactory dysfunction in PD, especially in early PD. The human brain can be conceptualised as an integrated large-scale network. The current focus in neuroimaging research is on the study of integrated models of brain structure and function, rather than a set of independently operating brain areas 24 . Graph-theoretical approaches allow one to characterise the segregation and integration within the nodes (i.e., brain regions) of the structural network 25 . Network-based statistics additionally offer complementary information about specific features within a network that can be applied to elucidating the structural and functional organisation of the brain 26 .\nIn the current study, we used DTI to investigate the whole brain to determine whether olfactory dysfunction would compromise WM regional and network properties in early PD. We hypothesised that WM would be altered at the network level, but not regional level, in early PD patients with olfactory dysfunction.",

Post-hoc analysis showed that hypos-PD patients performed worse than HCs on this test, but no difference was found between the two PD groups and between norms-PD and HC groups. As expected, a significant group difference was found in olfactory function (p  0.001). Post-hoc analysis indicated that both HCs and norms-PD patients had higher University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores than hypos-PD patients, whilst no significant difference existed between the former two groups. In addition, no significant differences were noted in disease duration, Hoehn  Yahr (HY) staging, and motor severity between the two PD groups.

No significant differences were found between the two patient groups and in other graph theoretical metrics.

NBS analysis revealed a single network of decreased structural connectivity in the hypos-PD group as compared with the HC group (t  3.662, p  0.01).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we comprehensively examined the whole brain for hyposmia-associated WM changes in newly diagnosed PDs using TBSS, graph-theoretical and network-based analyses. Findings from our study revealed no significant regional changes as reflected by FA and MD but observable alterations at the network level as evidenced by reduced global and local efficiency in the early disease stages of PD. Hypos-PD patients additionally showed reduced connectivity within a single network that comprised the right mOFC and left rectus, compared with HCs. Prior studies have observed FA reduction in the rectus 18 and reduced functional activation and connectivity in the OFC and rectus regions in hypos-PD patients 14 . In this study, we demonstrated that structural connection between these two regions was disrupted in early hypos-PD patients, thereby providing further support to the literature. Reduced connectivity strength between the right mOFC and left rectus also showed significant power to differentiate hypos-PD patients from HCs. Unlike previous functional MRI studies that showed widespread alterations of functional connectivity in PD patients with hyposmia 14,27,28 , we only observed a single microstructural network breakdown in our DT study. The explanations could be first, the use of different imaging modalities and different disease stages of patients in our study and in other studies. According to a recent report, subtle structural network alterations but more prominent functional network reduction were found in early PD 29 . Also, findings from prior neuroimaging studies in olfactory dysfunction in PD (see Supplementary Table S1) indicated that in general, studies using functional imaging, including PET and SPECT, observed more significant brain areas relating to olfactory impairment, compared with structural imaging studies. Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect less salient change in WM structural networks in early PD patients with hyposmia. Second, different imaging analytical approaches may also account for discrepant findings. For instance, ROI-based studies only examined few pre-selected brain regions and hence usually do not apply correction methods for multiple comparisons. In contrast, studies examining the whole brain are deemed to correction for multiple comparisons. Different analytical approaches and correction methods for multiple comparisons have different operations to determine statistical significance, which is likely to lead to different results. Nonetheless, hyposmia-related brain regions found in our current study on early and de novo PD were in good agreement with previous observations 14,18,19,30,31 .\nSimilarly, the fact that we did not find any group difference in regional WM characteristics or substantial changes in some graph-theoretical metrics, such as density and small-worldness, could be accounted for by the early disease stages of our patient participants who may have subtle structural changes. This view is supported by a recent DTI study that found limited changes in the global network metrics of early PD patients 32 . Although structural and functional connections in cellular networks may undergo dynamic changes over the span of human development, ageing, or disease progression, cellular functional networks are more responsive to transient synchronisation that occur within a short period of time 33 . As such, the view that relatively slow structural modifications are accompanied by faster changes in functional connections seems plausible. Notably, although there were some structural changes in early PD, especially among those with hyposmia, the changes were confined to the network level, suggesting that hyposmia-associated WM changes in early disease stages may be primarily related to network disconnection, but did not occur at the regional level.\nLarge-scale neural networks in the small-world model are geared towards a high global and local efficiency to minimise the consumption of energy and resources required for effective information processing 24 . Global efficiency is considered a good measure of the overall capacity for parallel information transfer and integrated processing 34 . Local efficiency quantifies the resistance of a network to failure on a small scale 24 . Reduced efficiency at both global and local levels was found in early PD and was able to differentiate PD patients from HCs, thus suggesting that compromised neural information processing and neural resistance to local damage exited in early PD.\nConsistent with previous literature, the majority of newly diagnosed PD patients in our study suffered olfactory dysfunction, thereby supporting the view that olfactory dysfunction is a consistent sign in early PD 234 . Despite being without significant cognitive impairment, hypos-PD patients showed poorer performance on the SDMT, compared with matched HCs. The SDMT is a measure of attention, visual scanning, and cognitive speed 35 . Successful performance on this test would require the frontal-related regions to be engaged 36 . This association between frontal-related cognitive dysfunction and olfactory dysfunction in PD have been reported previously 6 . As we found that hypos-PD patients had disrupted connection between the bilateral frontal regions, the impaired neuropsychological profile of this patient group was therefore in good agreement with the altered network features. As mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD involves frontostriatal dysfunction 37 , the observation of frontal cognitive impairment in the hypo-PD group implies that these patients may have a higher risk of developing MCI. Although the association between hyposmia and MCI due to Alzheimer pathology has been identified 38 , it remains understudied in PD. The cholinergic system is known to be associated with cognition in Alzheimers disease (AD) and PD, according to the work by Xu et al. 39 . Two recent studies revealed that PD patients with olfactory dysfunction exhibited cholinergic system degeneration, compared with norms-PD patients and HCs 40,41 . Further, cholinergic integrity in the limbic areas (e.g., hippocampal formation and amygdala) and neocortex was associated with olfactory performance in PD 5 . These pieces of evidence may explain why we found worse cognitive function in early PD patients with olfactory impairment. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the specific associations of olfactory dysfunction with different subtypes of MCI in PD.\nThe underlying mechanisms of hyposmia in PD may be manifold. Previous works have indicated the relationship between cardiovascular dysautonomia and olfactory dysfunction in PD 7,8 . Such a relationship was not found in atypical Parkinsonian diseases (e.g., multiple system atrophy) 42 , thereby suggesting the exclusive role of autonomic network failure in PD-related hyposmia. In addition, neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb might promote the aggregation of α-synuclein and thus lead to PD neuropathology 43 . Hyposmia may precede motor symptoms and is associated with dopaminergic abnormalities in the olfactory bulb in prodromal PD 44 . As anti-inflammatory therapies could slow disease progression 43 , future studies should examine the impact of neuroinflammation on hyposmia in the prodromal phase of PD and determine whether the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the prodromal phase may prevent the development of PD.\nThe strengths of our study were as follows. First, all PD patients in the study underwent DAT imaging to confirm the standard clinical diagnosis of PD. Second, we carefully controlled for head motion in DTI analysis and further ensured no group difference in head motion to reduce the confounding effects caused by motion. Finally, we adopted unbiased whole-brain analytical approaches to thoroughly examine WM properties of hypos-PD patients. One limitation of our study was the lack of functional or perfusion imaging to determine whether the alterations of neural activity relating to olfactory dysfunction would be more marked than structural network changes in this early PD cohort. A recent study demonstrated that the combination of DTI and arterial spin labeling modalities enabled higher accuracy of differentiating early PD patients from HCs 45 . It would be interesting to investigate whether such a combination will identify more sensitive and specific brain markers of hyposmia in PD. Although there have been few studies using functional MRI to examine the neural functional substrates of olfactory dysfunction in PD 14,27,28 , no known studies have examined the hyposmia-associated functional network properties in PD. Second, hyposmia is found not only in PD, but also in other neurological disorders, such as AD 46,47 . As we did not have other patient populations who also suffer hyposmia in the study, we were not able to compare the properties of the bilateral olfactory circuitry of different neurodegenerative patients with hyposmia, which was another limitation of the study. Finally, findings from our current work were based on cross-sectional observations and hence have prevented us from making any inference about the trajectory of WM network alterations in hypos-PD patients, and the impact of these changes on cognition as the disease progresses.",

    "Conclusions": {
      "text": "We show for the first time that in addition to the breakdown of the efficiency of information transfer and resistance to local neural deficits, a subnetwork connecting the right mOFC and left rectus was disrupted, whereas no regional changes were observed in early hypos-PD patients. By examining whole-brain regional and network topology of early PD patients, our findings suggest that compromised connectivity of the right mOFC and left rectus uniquely differentiates hypos-PD patients from HCs, and thus serve as a potential biomarker for hyposmia in early PD. Future studies may expand on this work by assessing whether alterations of this subnetwork can predict cognitive decline in hypos-PD patients.",

    "Network construction.": {
      "text": "A brain network can be described as a graph with nodes representing brain regions and edges that form connections between the nodes. The nodes were defined using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, which included a total of 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Motion-corrected DTI data was first reconstructed in the MNI space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR) to obtain the spin distribution function. A diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25 was used 60 . Whole-brain deterministic tractography was performed in DSI Studio (http:dsi-studio.labsolver.org). Fiber tracking was stopped if the reconstructed fiber entered a voxel with quantitative anisotropy (QA) of less than 0.2, and if the streamline made a turn with a curvature angle of more than 45 degrees. Tracts with length less than 30 mm were discarded. The overall pattern of WM connections between each pair of brain nodes was computed using weighted matrices. In the weighted matrices, each edge represented the product of the count of the connection tract. The connectivity matrices and graph theoretical analysis were conducted using the DSI Studio and Brain Connectivity Toolbox 25 . The following global network metrics were investigated: network density, clustering coefficient, small-worldness, global efficiency, local efficiency, and assortativity coefficient.\nNetwork-based statistics (NBS) 26 was used to further localise specific pairs of brain regions where WM structural connectivity was altered in hypos-PD patients. General linear models were used to examine the mean difference in connectivity strength (defined by QA) of any connected components between groups. A corrected p value was calculated for each component, using the null distribution of maximal connected component size derived with a nonparametric permutation method.\nStatistical analysis. Demographical and clinical data, and head motion during DTI acquisition were analysed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (version 21; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). For continuous variables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent-sample t tests were used to compare group differences where appropriate. Pearsons chi-squared or Fishers exact tests were used to compare categorical variables.\nA general lineal model using randomise in FSL was performed to test group differences in FA and MD between the hypos-PD, norms-PD and HC groups, whilst controlling for UPDRS-III. This program used permutation-based testing with 5000 permutations and statistical inference by applying threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) 61 with a threshold of p  0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.\nThe comparisons of global network metrics between groups were examined with ANCOVA controlling for UPDRS-III. P  0.05 was deemed to be significant. To determine the significance levels of altered connectivity networks in NBS analysis, we performed a general linear model controlling for UPDRS-III at each edge independently to test for group differences in connectivity. A threshold (p  0.05) was used to form a set of suprathreshold edges among which any connected components and their size (number of edges) could be determined. The statistical significance of the size of each observed component was assessed with respect to an empirical null distribution of maximal component sizes obtained under the null hypothesis of random group membership (5,000 permutations). Significant subnetworks were determined at p  0.05 (corrected).\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with leave-one-out cross validation was used to quantify the ability of significant global network metrics and subnetwork connectivity to enable discrimination between groups with the significance level being set at p  0.05.\nFinally, to assess whether differences in olfactory and cognitive functions between PD patients with and without hyposmia might be associated with regional and network WM changes, correlation analyses between significant WM changes and UPSIT and significant cognitive variables were performed across the two patients groups using Pearsons linear correlations (corrected for UPDRS-III, p  0.05 as the significance threshold).",

    "abstract": "Individuals carrying the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) are at increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the biological mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear because of the complexity of the pathological processes that cause AD. Furthermore, the effect of APOE genotype on development, maintenance and aging of the normal brain is poorly understood because of the strong bias toward studying disease associations. In vivo techniques such as neuroimaging and cognitive testing offer valuable insights into the effects of APOE genotype on brain structure and function in healthy and clinical populations. We review the evidence from in vivo studies that APOE E4, in addition to increasing the chance of age-related pathological events, is associated with age-independent non-pathological changes in brain physiology, some of which make the brain less resilient to neurodegenerative processes. We argue that the interaction between the APOE-dependent non-pathological vulnerabilities and age-related pathological changes is one mechanism that can trigger neurodegeneration, resulting in AD and other complex phenotypes.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "In the context of generally weak associations of specific genes with complex traits or diseases, the strong association of the apolipoprotein E gene APOE with Alzheimers disease (AD) stands out as an exception (Genin et al., 2011). Individuals carrying the APOE E4 allele are at increased risk of developing AD and have decreased age of onset (Corder et al., 1993;Raber et al., 2004;Strittmatter et al., 1993), but the biological mechanisms underlying these observations are poorly understood. Given the growing burden of AD-related morbidity (Sperling et al., 2011), the issue of how APOE genotype affects a broad range of biological processes across the lifespan is of considerable clinical and scientific interest.\nApoE is essential for normal lipid homeostasis in the brain (Bu, 2009;Holtzman et al., 2012) and there is growing evidence that APOE genotype influences multiple physiological pathways (Mahley et al., 2006). We review the evidence that APOE E4 has effects on brain structure and function that are not in themselves pathological, but appear to make the brain more susceptible to ageassociated pathological mechanisms. The mechanisms reviewed are important because they are relevant for risk evaluation and accessible to studies with in vivo imaging or behavioral methods. Development of neurodegenerative pathology is dependent on a number of factors (Holtzman et al., 2012), some of which are related to APOE genotype and some not. The early stages of pathological cognitive change (mild cognitive impairment -MCI) are extremely heterogenous (Stephan et al., 2012) and there is a clear need to identify a specific APOE-related pathophysiological phenotype with behavioral and imaging markers.\nWe argue that the onset of neurodegenerative disease is caused by interaction of APOE-related vulnerabilities with age-dependent pathological mechanisms. The most important of these is accumulation of amyloid , but other factors such as accelerated rate of degeneration of cholinergic neurons and APOE-related vascular abnormalities may also significantly influence the clinical phenotype.\nWe aim to answer the following questions:\n1. How does APOE E4 increase the risk of early presentation of Alzheimers disease? 2. Why do some carriers of E4 not develop AD? (Corder et al., 1993;Strittmatter et al., 1993) and decreases the age of diagnosis (Raber et al., 2004). E4 homozygosity confers about 14 times increase in lifetime risk compared to E3 homozygosity, but in an age-dependent manner, with a maximum relative risk of 35 in the age group 60-69 (Genin et al., 2011). E3E4 heterozygotes have a 4-fold increase in relative risk compared to E3 homozygotes for all ages above 60. The frequency of the E4 allele varies in different populations (Gerdes, 2003), and in some ethnic groups E4 has a weaker or no clear effect on AD risk (Kalaria et al., 2008;Mayeux, 2003). The APOE E4 allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD, yet the basis of this association is poorly understood owing to the complexity of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. AD, the most common form of age-related dementia, is characterized by neuronal degeneration, synaptic loss, brain atrophy and accumulation of insoluble aggregates of amyloid  and tau proteins (Verghese et al., 2011). The ApoE protein has been implicated in many of the processes that are thought to cause these devastating changes (Holtzman et al., 2012;Mahley et al., 2006;Verghese et al., 2011), but it has proven very difficult to identify the specific effects of APOE genotype that are most important for the initiation and progression of pathological mechanisms. Another major challenge is to determine whether APOE genotype affects the structure and function of the normal brain, through roles in neurodevelopment, maintenance and repair.",

    "Physiological functions of ApoE in the brain": {
      "text": "ApoE is strongly expressed in brain and liver and transports lipids, including cholesterol, through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma (Bu, 2009;Holtzman et al., 2012). In the brain, ApoE is synthesized by astrocytes and microglia but can also be produced by neurons following injury. Cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes and myelin, is required for development, maintenance and repair of myelin sheaths, neuronal membranes and synaptic connections (Pfrieger, 2003). ApoE plays a significant role in supplying cholesterol for these processes. Several pathogenic factors leading to cell damage, including ischemia, put increasing stress on repair mechanisms and lead to upregulation of ApoE (Bu, 2009). The surge in ApoE levels after neuronal injury may be important for synaptic and membrane repair by redistributing lipids and cholesterol (Holtzman et al., 2012). There is no in vivo biomarker uniquely associated with synaptogenesis or synaptic density, but several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, both morphometric and microstructural, may be indirectly affected (see Table 1).",

    "Myelination in aging": {
      "text": "Developmental myelination is a process continuing into midlife, with thin intracortical axons among the last to be myelinated (Bartzokis et al., 2012). In human autopsy samples, there is significant loss of thinner, late myelinating fiber sheaths with age (Marner et al., 2003). The brains of aged rhesus monkeys show signs of general myelin degeneration, which correlates with cognitive decline, but there is also evidence of active myelin repair (Peters and Kemper, 2012;Peters and Sethares, 2003). Thus, in the normal aging primate brain, developmental myelination, myelin degeneration and remyelination may all occur. Remyelination is qualitatively different from developmental myelination (Fancy et al., 2011). During development, the thickness of the myelin sheath is closely correlated with axonal diameter, whereas in remyelination the sheath is often inappropriately thin, which could cause reduced conduction velocity (Fancy et al., 2011;Peters and Kemper, 2012). Loss of myelin may secondarily lead to axonal loss (Fancy et al., 2011).\nImaging techniques can be used to probe human white matter structure in vivo (Table 1). Madden et al. (2009) have reviewed the evidence that cognitive aging is related to white matter integrity, and conclude that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows an age-related decline with an anterior to posterior brain gradient. Bartzokis et al. (2012) have suggested that certain MRI and DTI parameters reflect specific changes in myelination. Transverse relaxation rate (R2) and radial diffusivity (RD) show a general agerelated decline in late-myelinating regions (Bartzokis et al., 2012). a Automated methods for quantification of regional cortical thickness have been developed by Dale, Fischl and co-workers (Fischl et al., 2002). b DTI is sensitive to the directionality and degree of water displacement in biological tissues. By applying magnetic fields in different directions it is possible to estimate a 3D model reflecting the magnitude and direction of water diffusion within each voxel, from which various parameters can be derived. The 3D model is ellipsoidal, with an elongated ellipsoid reflecting highly directional water diffusion and a sphere reflecting equal diffusion in all directions. Fractional anisotropy (FA) reflects the directional coherence of the diffusion. Axial (AxD) and radial (RD) diffusion denote the length of the largest and second largest eigenvalue of the ellipsoid, usually interpreted as the degree of diffusion along and perpendicular to the longest axis of the ellipse, respectively. Mean diffusion (MD) represents the average magnitude of diffusion along all three axes in space, i.e. the estimated bulk of diffusivity irrespective of direction. Importantly, the biological specificity of the DTI indices is not clear (Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani, 2009), but RD is likely to be more sensitive to mechanisms restricting the diffusion across rather than along the axons, and is thus thought to be more closely related to membrane and myelin integrity than AxD, which is likely to be more related to axonal integrity and damage (Budde et al., 2009).\nc By investigating the spatiotemporal correlation patterns of the BOLD signal, resting-state fMRI targets the intrinsic (in contrast to evoked) functional integration of different brain regions, and different analysis methods provide various indices of functional connectivity (FC; Margulies et al., 2010). Resting-state FC (RSFC) has promoted the understanding of the fundamental organization of the processing systems in the brain, and has revealed specific functional neuronal networks (Biswal et al., 1995), including low-level sensorimotor and higher-order attention and cognitive control networks (Zhang and Raichle, 2010). Such resting state networks (RSNs) are identifiable in the absence of specific contextual demands, but show high correspondence with task-evoked networks (Smith et al., 2009). RSFC may be particularly useful for studies comparing functional brain network properties within or between groups where matching of cognitive task performance is a challenge (e.g. when comparing subjects across clinical groups or across large age ranges), or even impossible (e.g. when comparing across species or subjects of different levels of consciousness). Since AD pathology occurs preferentially throughout brain regions comprising the default mode network (DMN), an intriguing hypothesis is that intrinsic DMN metabolism is related to disease processes and memory decline (Buckner et al., 2008;Greicius et al., 2004).",

      "text": "Given that cholesterol is an essential component of myelin, and ApoE is the most abundant cholesterol transporter in the CNS (Bu, 2009;Holtzman et al., 2012), it is of considerable interest to determine whether APOE genotype affects myelination status. In studies of healthy individuals aged 55-76, the MRI R2 parameter, which is thought to indicate myelin integrity, was significantly lower in older carriers of the APOE E4 allele and was associated with reduced cognitive processing speed in E4 carriers (Bartzokis et al., 2006(Bartzokis et al., , 2007)). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that myelin repair is less efficient in E4 carriers (Bartzokis et al., 2007).",

Mitochondrial alterations caused by neurotoxic ApoE 4 fragments may be an important amyloid -independent neuropathological mechanism involving the E4 allele.\nIn a study of autopsy brain tissue from the posterior cingulate cortex of 15 young E4 carriers and 25 controls, Valla et al. (2010) found reduced cytochrome oxidase activity indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction in the E4 carriers. The findings were unrelated to amyloid  or tau. Gene expression profiling of post-mortem cortical brain tissue from 13 E4 carriers and 28 non-carriers of mean age 42 years revealed that biological pathways involved with among others mitochondrial function were affected in the E4 group (Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2011). There were also regional differences in expression of APOE itself, with higher expression in regions more vulnerable to Alzheimer pathology. The brains analyzed were free of plaque and tangle pathology.",

    "Effect of aging on the cholinergic system": {
      "text": "Reduced nicotinic receptor availability has been reported in normal aging (Mitsis et al., 2009). The structure of the human basal forebrain cholinergic system can be analyzed in vivo using MRI and DTI (Grothe et al., 2010(Grothe et al., , 2012;;Teipel et al., 2011). In a study of 200 cognitively normal subjects (20-94 years), Grothe et al. (2012) found a linear age-related shrinkage of the basal forebrain beginning in young adulthood. There is evidence that age-related cholinergic dysfunction is mediated mainly by mechanisms including decreased cellular function, lower brain choline uptake, neuronal shrinkage, axonal degeneration, and synaptic loss, rather than definite cell loss (Schliebs and Arendt, 2011). In a post-mortem study of 14 neurologically healthy individuals, Tohgi et al. (1998) found an age-related decrease in nicotinic receptor mRNA expression in cortex and hippocampus. In the cortex there is regional variation in the density of cholinergic fibers, as shown by immunohistochemistry, with especially high fiber density in the hippocampus (Geula and Mesulam, 1996).",

      "text": "In addition to a general neurotoxic effect of ApoE fragments, there is evidence from animal studies that ApoE peptides specifically impair cholinergic functions (Mahley et al., 2006;Verghese et al., 2011). Peptides derived from the LDLR-binding domain of ApoE block the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat hippocampal slices (Klein and Yakel, 2004). Direct infusion of the same ApoE peptides into the ventral hippocampus of rats caused significant cognitive impairment in radial-arm maze learning that persisted for several weeks (Eddins et al., 2009). Siegel et al. (2011) found that Apoe --knockout mice had fewer cortical and hippocampal muscarinic acetyl choline receptors compared to wild-type animals. Allen et al. (1997) found that choline acetyltransferase activity in post-mortem brain tissue from cognitively normal persons was lower in E4 carriers. The findings were significant for temporal cortex and were independent of the presence of senile plaques. Cognitive studies in healthy normal controls have indicated that APOE genotype interacts with allelic variation in a cholinergic gene (CHRNA4) to influence attention performance (Espeseth et al., 2006;Reinvang et al., 2010a).",

    "Vascular function": {
      "text": "A meta-analysis of blood-brain-barrier permeability showed that neurologically healthy humans had an age-dependent increase in vascular permeability (Farrall and Wardlaw, 2009). Disruption of the blood-brain-barrier function can lead to defective regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with further pathological consequences (Zlokovic, 2011). Normal aging diminishes brain circulatory functions, including a detectable decay of CBF in the limbic and association cortices that has been suggested to underlie agerelated cognitive changes (Martin et al., 1991).\nIn transgenic mice with human APOE E4 instead of the endogenous Apoe gene, the ApoE 4 protein stimulates an inflammatory pathway in pericytes surrounding brain capillaries (Bell et al., 2012). Even in very young animals, the brain vasculature was damaged, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier was reduced and CBF was lower. These changes were followed by neuronal and synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Although these findings highlight an amyloid-independent mechanism by which APOE E4 can trigger vascular pathology and neurodegeneration, E4 does not inevitably cause neuropathology in humans, so further work is needed to determine the relevance of this pathway in man.\nAPOE genotype is associated with different forms of cerebrovascular disease and cerebrovascular risk factors in epidemiological studies. In an imaging study of nearly 4000 individuals aged 45 and up without dementia from the general population, Poels et al. (2010) found that the prevalence of asymptomatic microbleeds gradually increased with age. Deep or infratentorial microbleeds were associated with cardiovascular risk factors, lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions, while lobar microbleeds were associated with APOE E4 and diastolic blood pressure. Zade et al. (2010) carried out neuropsychological testing of 1995 participants (mean age 61) from the Framingham Heart Study and found that the E4 allele exacerbates the effects of cerebrovascular risk factors on neuropsychological function. Systolic blood pressure was the only individual risk factor significantly linked to cognitive measures.",

The effects of APOE genotype can be assessed independently of amyloid  by studying individuals in an age range where amyloid  accumulation is absent or infrequent, and therefore unlikely to bias the results. When participants are below the age of 50, one can be confident that there is no or minimal influence of early AD pathology and amyloid  burden remains relatively low even in E4 carriers until the early 60s (Morris et al., 2010). We therefore review studies selectively and focus mainly on the age range up to about 65.",

    "APOE-related effects on cognition": {
      "text": "Bloss et al. ( 2008) used a test of educational achievement to study 109 children aged 11-16. Information was collected from parents about family history of dementia: no main effect of APOE genotype alone or family history alone was found but E4 carriers with a family history of AD did significantly worse in tests of reading, language and figure copying. Taylor et al. (2011) investigated associations between APOE genotype and plasma lipids (at age 9), IQ (at age 8), memory (at ages 8 and 10), and performance in school attainment tests (at ages 7, 11, and 14) in nearly 6000 children. Although APOE genotype was strongly associated with lipid levels, there were no significant associations with intelligence, memory or school attainment.\nIn a community sample of 220 individuals with a mean age of 46 years (range 24-60), Flory et al. (2000) found that E4 carriers performed significantly worse than E2 or E3 carriers in tests of learning and memory. The findings held after adjustment for age. The study by Jorm et al. (2007) is important by virtue of its high number of participants (N  6560) in three separate age cohorts (20s, 40s and 60s). No effect of APOE genotype was found on either episodic memory, attention or reaction time in any age group. When the oldest group was followed up 4 years later, development of MCI was not related to E4 carrier status, but E4 had some influence on cognitive decline when interaction with head injury or premorbid intelligence was taken into consideration (Christensen et al., 2008). Mondadori et al. (2007) studied the effect of APOE genotype on a memory test in 340 young participants (mean age 23 years), 34 of whom performed the test in an fMRI session. E4 carriers performed better than E3 carriers, and also showed lower activation levels in memory-relevant areas of the brain during task performance. In a study of two groups of healthy subjects aged 45-60 and 61-79, Reinvang et al. (2010a) found no effect of APOE genotype on cognitive function at baseline or on cognitive decline after 3.5 years in the younger group. However, there was evidence that APOE genotype interacted with variants in CHRNA4 (cholinergic receptor neural nicotinic alpha chain 4) to affect decline in attention and memory. This interaction was mostly independent of age. Caselli et al. (2009) carried out a longitudinal study of an E4enriched cohort with familial risk of AD covering a wide age-range. Using growth-curve modeling combining cross-sectional and longitudinal data, they concluded that memory test performance in E4 homozygotes starts to deviate from non-carriers prior to age 60. In a separate study of 10 individuals with declining memory and 15 non-decliners Caselli et al. (2008) found that reduced metabolic rate, determined by fluoride-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET (Table 1), predates cognitive decline by 3-4 years.\nSome studies have focused explicitly on experimental cognitive tasks of attention and working memory. In a longitudinal study of middle-aged and young-old individuals, Greenwood et al. (2000)) found that E4 carriers showed greater decline in a visual attention test. However, 78 of the participants had first degree relatives with AD, so this sample is likely to be biased toward individuals with incipient dementia. Other work by Greenwood et al. (2005) revealed deficits in visual attention and working memory in E4 carriers, but the study group had a significant proportion of older participants. Espeseth et al. (2012) combined structural MRI, event-related potentials and attention measures in a middle-aged group (mean age 62) and found that E4 affects cortical thickness of critical nodes in brain attentional networks. Rosen et al. (2002) reported that middle-aged E4 carriers performed worse on a working memory task requiring divided attention. Reinvang et al. (2010b) confirmed a working memory deficit, but only in male E4 homozygotes. E4 carriers did not exhibit episodic memory deficits in either of these studies.",

      "text": "In conclusion, evidence for non-pathological APOE-related deficits in cognition is sparse and conflicting. A large meta-analysis found evidence for memory deficits in E4 carriers (Wisdom et al., 2011), but many of the studies analyzed may have involved middle-aged and old persons at different stages of prodromal AD. It remains an intriguing possibility that E4 may be associated with subtle deficits in specific measures of attention or working memory.\n3.2. APOE-related non-pathological effects determined by MRI imaging 3.2.1. Resting-state functional MRI and functional connectivity Filippini et al. (2009) studied 18 E4 carriers, aged 20-35, and matched controls and reported a higher degree of default-mode network (DMN) co-activation in carriers. There were no differences in gray matter volume. The pattern of increased DMN integration during rest in healthy E4 carriers was recently replicated and extended to a sample of middle-aged and elderly subjects (Westlye et al., 2011). E4 carriers showed evidence of increased coupling between the hippocampus and the posterior DMN, which was taken to reflect a relative failure to decouple the hippocampus during rest. In support of this, the degree of hippocampal DMN coupling correlated inversely with memory performance, i.e. higher coupling was related to poorer memory performance (Westlye et al., 2011). Sheline et al. (2010) studied resting state connectivity with fMRI in 100 healthy persons of mean age 62 years, who were free of amyloid plaques as judged by PET. E4 carriers showed an altered pattern of connectivity, predating any cognitive decline, from the precuneus to the hippocampus and temporal lobe regions, which are also involved in AD pathology. Trachtenberg et al. (2012b) recently performed a similar analysis on 10 different resting-state networks (RSNs), including medial and lateral visual, sensorimotor, auditory, DMN, an executive control network, right and left frontoparietal networks, and anterior and posterior hippocampal networks in 77 healthy subjects aged 32-55 years. APOE genotype affected the anterior and posterior hippocampal networks, the auditory network, and the left frontoparietal network. Intriguingly, functional integration was similar in E2 and E4 carriers, but both groups differed significantly from E3 homozygotes. The authors concluded that in healthy adults, APOE genotype affects the differentiation of functional brain networks independently of the APOE-related increased risk of AD, and may instead reflect a functional role of different ApoE isoforms during neurodevelopment.\nUsing seed-based analyses, Machulda et al. (2011) studied connectivity in the DMN and the salience network (a network assumed to be inversely correlated with DMN and showing intensified connectivity in AD), and found altered connectivity in 56 cognitively normal E4 carriers relative to 56 matched noncarriers. Specifically, a seed in the posterior cingulate revealed decreased functional connectivity in regions of the posterior DMN including the left middle temporal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and bilateral anterior temporal lobules. In contrast, a seed in the anterior cingulate revealed increased functional connectivity in the salience network including the cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus (Machulda et al., 2011). Importantly, the participants were all above age 70 and it is unclear whether the findings generalize to younger populations.\nFindings from specific task-related fMRI studies are beyond the scope of the present overview, and we refer interested readers to previous excellent reviews (Bookheimer and Burggren, 2009;Trachtenberg et al., 2012c).",

    "Fiber integrity and structural connectivity": {
      "text": "The consistent observations of alterations in patterns of functional connectivity (FC) in E4 carriers may be indicative of changes in white matter microstructural integrity. A number of DTI studies have documented decreased diffusion anisotropy in E4 carriers (Heise et al., 2011;Honea et al., 2009;Nierenberg et al., 2005;Persson et al., 2006), possibly indicating less coherent fiber architecture or altered microstructural integrity. Heise et al. (2011) compared younger (age 20-35) with older (age 50-78) subjects and observed a complex pattern of effects of APOE genotype in the two groups, but concluded that there was no evidence of age group by APOE interactions on any of the DTI measures. Previous reports converge on reduced white matter diffusion anisotropy in E4 carriers, but Bendlin et al. (2010) reported no main effect of APOE genotype on FA, MD or any of the tested DTI parameters in a large sample (N  136) of healthy middle-aged volunteers (mean age 55-60), including 56 E4 carriers. However, an effect of E4 was found in participants with a family history of AD. Recently, Brown et al. (2011) compared graph-theoretical indices of structural connectivity derived from DTI tractography measures in a sample of 25 carriers (mean age 60.8, SD  9.7 years) and 30 non-carriers (mean age: 63.8, SD  8.3 years) of the E4 allele. Relative to non-carriers, E4 carriers showed evidence of accelerated age-related loss in small-worldness with age, which was taken to reflect a loss in the balance between global integration and local modularity of information processing (Brown et al., 2011). Interestingly, E4 carriers were found to exhibit accelerated age-related loss in local interconnectivity among regions comprising the DMN (Buckner et al., 2008), which corroborates evidence reviewed above of altered DMN connectivity in E4 carriers (Filippini et al., 2009;Machulda et al., 2011;Westlye et al., 2011).\nIn summary, DTI studies have produced conflicting evidence of the role of APOE genotype as a modulator of white matter microstructure in healthy subjects. Most studies have been performed on middle-aged and elderly volunteers, where the risk of confounding effects of incipient neurodegenerative disease is high, and little is known about the timing of the effects, i.e. whether APOE genotype has already modulated white matter microstructure during neurodevelopment, or whether the effects are mainly operating by accelerating the rate of aging. In a recent study (Westlye et al., 2012) studied a larger (N  203) healthy sample than previously reported with a wide age distribution (21-70 years) and showed an age-independent increase in radial diffusivity in E4 carriers (Fig. 1). Interestingly, similar changes were observed in E2 carriers, suggesting that the effect of APOE genotype on white matter microstructure is independent of its effect on AD risk. The general observation that genotypic effects do not directly reflect the risk of AD is also supported by recent functional imaging studies (Trachtenberg et al., 2012a(Trachtenberg et al., , 2012b)).",

(2013) observed decreased gray matter volume in the temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, and increased parietal lobe volumes in E4 heterozygous babies compared to E3 homozygotes. Whereas these intriguing results suggest that effects of APOE on brain structure are already present at or even before birth, most of the available evidence comes from studies of adult samples. In a study including 239 healthy children, adolescents and young adults (age 8-20), Shaw et al. (2007) found that the left entorhinal region was thinnest in E4 carriers, intermediate in E3 homozygotes and thickest in E2 carriers. Many of the participants underwent multiple scans and the neuroanatomical effects of APOE genotype seemed to be fixed over the age-range examined. Fennema-Notestine et al. ( 2011) studied a large group of healthy 50-59 year olds and found reduced cortical thickness in frontal but not in temporal regions in E4 carriers. Using a model of regional covariance in regional gray matter volume as estimated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), Alexander et al. (2012) found a pattern of gray matter reduction in E4 carriers (N  14, age 26-45) involving bilateral frontal, anterior cingulate, parietal, and lateral temporal cortices with correlated volume increases in the hippocampal region. Bunce et al. (2012) studied 314 healthy participants aged 44-48 and found no effect of E4 on the volume of entorhinal cortex, medial temporal lobe or temporal neocortex. Other brain regions were not investigated.\nIn a study of morphometric variation in middle-aged and olderage individuals, Espeseth et al. (2008) found that middle-aged E4 carriers had a thicker cortex than non-carriers in several frontal and temporal areas in both hemispheres, but showed a steeper age-related decline in adjacent areas. Upon comparison of the E4specific age-related thinning with previously published patterns of thinning in normal aging and AD, they concluded that E4 may function to accelerate thinning in areas found to decline in normal aging (medial prefrontal and pericentral cortex), but also to initiate thinning in areas associated with AD and amyloid  aggregation (occipitotemporal and basal temporal cortex). A follow up study by Espeseth et al. (2012) showed that cortical thickness in selected regions was associated with attention performance and amplitude of attention-related ERP (event-related potential) components. Chen et al. (2007) studied healthy cognitively normal persons aged 47-68 with repeated morphometric MRI scans. E4 homozygotes showed an accelerated rate of brain atrophy while remaining cognitively normal. All participants in this study had a first degree relative with AD, which is likely to have an important impact on the results (Donix et al., 2012). Donix et al. (2010) studied 32 cognitively intact subjects (16 APOE E4 carriers and 16 non-carriers, mean age 61 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI scans. Over the course of two years there was significantly greater cortical thinning in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of E4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Average cortical thinning across all medial temporal lobe subregions combined was also significantly greater in E4 carriers.\nIn summary, several studies reviewed above converge on a significant impact of APOE on brain morphology. The evidence further suggests that the effects may already be present at birth, and that APOE may also modulate the rate of brain aging. However, many morphometric studies of healthy adults are marred by small samples, and selective reporting is likely to have produced a biased impression. Further, E4 is likely to interact with other pathological factors, making it hard to isolate the unique genetic effect. Interestingly, the ENIGMA consortium performed a meta-analysis of GWAS studies in cognitively normal samples, focusing on hippocampus volume, intracranial volume and whole brain volume of more than 5700 cognitively normal participants. Importantly, APOE genotype did not emerge as strongly associated with any of the included brain parameters (Stein et al., 2012). Thus, findings of reduced hippocampal volume reported in several earlier studies (Cherbuin et al., 2007) may be caused by inclusion of older persons with pathology.",

      "text": "MR findings (structural MRI and DTI) point to changes in white matter integrity and brain connectivity associated with E4, possibly through myelin and lipid metabolism. There is some evidence that morphometric changes such as reduced hippocampal volume or entorhinal cortex thickness occur early in life, but a recent large-scale GWAS study questions this finding. Recent studies with relatively high numbers of middle-aged participants point to an association between E4 and changes in the frontal rather than the temporal lobe. Findings may have been affected by selection of participants according to familial AD or history of brain injury. It can be assumed that these results are not strongly influenced by presence of amyloid , either because it has been explicitly controlled for or because of the relatively young age of participants. 2004) studied glucose metabolism in 12 E4 heterozygotes and controls aged 20-30 with FDG-PET (Table 1) and found a pattern of regional hypometabolism similar to that in patients with AD, including bilaterally in the posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. There was considerable overlap between groups, and the E4 carrier group was small (N  13). In the absence of atrophy, this finding is consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in E4 carriers. Another study (Scarmeas et al., 2003) confirmed reduced temporal lobe perfusion in young E4 carriers, but included only 3 carriers.",

    "Effects of APOE genotype in prodromal and early AD": {
      "text": "The role of APOE genotype in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders has been extensively reviewed (Bu, 2009;Kim et al., 2009;Verghese et al., 2011). The consensus is that the differential effects of ApoE isoforms on amyloid  aggregation and clearance play a major role in AD pathogenesis. The E4 allele may cause a gain of toxic function in the ApoE protein, or a loss of neuroprotective function, or both. In vivo imaging of ligands that bind to pathological protein deposits, such as PiB which binds to amyloid  plaques (Table 1), has made it possible to distinguish between probable preclinical AD and other age-related conditions. Evidence from PiB-PET imaging and autopsy studies indicate that amyloid  accumulation may take place in the late forties or earlier in cognitively normal individuals (Braak and Braak, 1997;Kok et al., 2009;Rowe et al., 2010).\nThe cascade model of AD proposed by Jack et al. ( 2010) points to development and accumulation of amyloid  oligomers as the earliest event in AD pathophysiology, followed by tau accumulation occurring up to 20 years before diagnosis, whereas brain atrophy measured by MRI and cognitive changes are late events that occur 2-5 years before diagnosis. These mechanisms are assumed to unfold in a causal sequence with relatively little overlap between phases; thus amyloid  and tau accumulation is the cause of subsequent brain atrophy and cognitive and clinical decline, but further accumulation has no direct role in determining the rate of progression of degeneration and cognitive impairment. A key question arising from this model is whether the effect of APOE genotype can be accounted for solely by its influence on amyloid  accumulation, or if it has an independent role in influencing imaging, cognitive and clinical phenotypes. Factors which reduce clearance of amyloid  from the brain, such as the 4 isoform of the ApoE protein, initiate a chronic inflammatory response which leads to further deposition of amyloid. APOE genotype also has an impact on the brain vascular system (Poels et al., 2010), and the ApoE 4 protein causes vascular pathology in mice (Bell et al., 2012). Since the first step of Herrups model involves an initiating injury, APOE genotype might act independently to increase the probability that the initiating injury is vascular in nature. This would lead to a higher frequency of vascular components in subsequent clinical AD in E4 carriers, as has been reported by Thal et al. (2010).",

      "text": "The three common isoforms of ApoE differ profoundly in structure and function (Mahley et al., 2006) including their ability to interact with amyloid . Increasing E4 dose is associated with reduced clearance and increased accumulation of amyloid . In the early stages of amyloid deposition, cortical areas andor layers that are sparsely myelinated have denser amyloid deposits than those rich in myelin. Cognitively normal APOE E4 carriers show increased uptake of the amyloid-binding ligand PiB (Morris et al., 2010;Reiman et al., 2009) and the amyloid-and tau-binding ligand FDDNP (Small et al., 2009) when compared to non-carriers. In a PiB-PET study of 135 cognitively normal persons of mean age 75 years, 65 of PiB-positive individuals were E4 carriers compared to 24 of the PiB-negative subjects (Storandt et al., 2009). Concurrent cognitive performance was unrelated to amyloid  levels but was related to regional brain volumes with the exception of the caudate. Kantarci et al. (2012) found that whereas amyloid  load is associated with greater cognitive impairment in APOE E4 carriers, cognitive function in non-carriers is influenced less by the amyloid  load, suggesting that ApoE isoforms modulate the harmful effects of amyloid  on cognitive function. Vlassenko et al. (2011) did a follow-up PiB study of 246 subjects who were initially cognitively normal and found that E4 carriers had an increased plaque burden of 8 per year and were at greater risk of converting to PiBpositive status. Kok et al. (2009) studied an autopsy series of 603 community-dwelling persons and found that while senile plaque density was strongly related to APOE E4 carrier status in every age group, the most marked contrast to E3E3 was found in the 50-59 age group. It is not clear at present if ApoE 4 plays a role in the initial formation of amyloid , or just accelerates the rate of amyloid  formation once the process has started, but the studies of Morris et al. (2010) and Vlassenko et al. (2011) suggest that both may be the case.",

      "text": "As mentioned above, PiB-PET imaging has made it possible to study the early effects of amyloid  accumulation in vivo. Abnormal brain levels of amyloid  are also reflected indirectly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration, with low levels in CSF indicating cerebral accumulation of amyloid  as measured with PiB (Tolboom et al., 2009).\nIn healthy volunteers over 60 years of age, Pike et al. ( 2011) found twice the incidence of APOE E4 in PiB-positive participants. In a sample covering the clinical range from healthy controls to AD, Vemuri et al. (2010a) found that at baseline, E4 dose was predictive of amyloid  levels in CSF, but less so of ventricular atrophy as determined by MRI. At follow-up, however, E4 predicted greater annual increase in ventricular volume in patients with MCI, but did not predict change in CSF amyloid  levels (Vemuri et al., 2010b). Chetelat et al. (2011) reported that hippocampal atrophy and PiB retention in temporal neocortex contributed independently to memory function in non-demented, amyloid -positive individuals. Sperling et al. (2009) found that high levels of amyloid deposition were associated with aberrant DMN activity in asymptomatic and minimally impaired older individuals, similar to the pattern of dysfunction reported in AD patients. Some E4-related deficits in resting state connectivity may have been present prior to or independently of amyloid deposition (Sheline et al., 2010). Tosun et al. (2010) found that the relationship between CSF biomarkers, APOE E4 status and brain atrophy rates is regionally specific. In individuals with MCI, CSF biomarker concentrations (i.e. lower amyloid , higher tau markers) and APOE E4 were independently associated with higher rates of ventricular enlargement and tissue volume loss bilaterally in the hippocampus and several other regions. Similarly, lower CSF amyloid -42 and E4 together were associated with higher rates of cortical thinning in temporoparietal cortex, including precuneus and posterior cingulate. In a study of both cognitively normal and memory-impaired participants, Chiang et al. (2011) found that baseline CSF amyloid  predicted progression of hippocampal volume loss in all groups, and APOE E4 was independently associated with volume loss. However, APOE E4 acted synergistically with amyloid to amplify the degree of neurodegeneration in MCI. In an MRI study focussing on change in hippocampal volume over 6-12 months, Schuff et al. (2009) found that MCI and AD groups showed accelerated loss compared to normal individuals over 1 year. E4 was associated with a higher rate of volume loss and smaller baseline volume irrespective of severity of cognitive symptoms, but there was no dose effect of E4. CSF amyloid  was correlated with MRI only in the group classified as having MCI. In a study including both regional PiB measures of amyloid load and MRI measures of atrophy, Jack et al. ( 2008) found variable relationships. The frontal lobes had high PiB retention with little gray matter loss, anteromedial temporal areas had low PiB retention with significant gray matter loss, whereas lateral temporoparietal association cortex displayed both significant PiB retention and gray matter loss. This study did not include E4 as a variable.\nThe studies cited above reflect complex relationships between amyloid  load, cerebral morphometric variables and cognition, which are further modulated by the clinical status of the participants. However, indications are that APOE E4, in addition to having an impact on amyloid  load, affects brain structure either independently of (Chiang et al., 2011;Schuff et al., 2009;Tosun et al., 2010;Vemuri et al., 2010a) or synergistically with (Chiang et al., 2011;Tosun et al., 2010) amyloid  load.",

      "text": "Several studies show that E4 carriers may have different cognitive or neurodegenerative clinical profiles to non-carriers. APOE E4 is associated with risk of the amnestic (memory impairment) form of MCI, but not with other subtypes (Brainerd et al., 2011). Wolk and Dickerson (2010) examined if APOE genotype was associated with a specific cognitive phenotype in mild AD and found that E4 carriers showed poorer memory retention and greater medial temporal lobe atrophy while non-carriers were more impaired on tests of working memory and executive control, and had more frontoparietal atrophy. In a comparative study of amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subtypes, He et al. (2009) found that APOE E4 carriers were twice as prevalent in the amnestic group. In a study of memory clinic patients (mean age 54-64 in different subgroups), CSF levels of pathological markers were correlated with memory performance in E4 carriers but not in non-carriers (Andersson et al., 2007).\nSome studies have examined both regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and MRI brain morphometry in MCI. (Luckhaus et al., 2010) found that hippocampal but not amygdalar volume was associated with one or two E4 alleles in MCI and mild AD, while there was no association of E4 with rCBF. They concluded that their data supports earlier indications that rCBF and regional volume changes are at least partly dissociated in the early pathogenesis of AD, and heterogeneously associated with E4. In contrast, Thambisetty et al. (2010) found in a longitudinal study that cognitively normal E4 carriers showed hypoperfusion several years before developing MCI. Wierenga et al. (2012) found that CBF was elevated in the parahippocampalfusiform gyrus in cognitively normal E4 carriers but decreased in E4 carriers with MCI. The opposite pattern was seen in frontal regions.\nIt is well documented that conversion of MCI to AD is accelerated by APOE E4 (Drzezga et al., 2005;Rowe et al., 2010;Schuff et al., 2009). APOE genotype has a clear effect on the rate of amyloid  accumulation and rate of atrophy of brain structures as reviewed above. Other APOE-related factors may also influence clinical progression or phenotypic expression, most importantly cholinergic or cerebrovascular functions. These additional effects of APOE genotype may accelerate disease progression and bias the clinical MCI phenotype toward an amnestic type.",

    "Clinical cholinergic mechanisms": {
      "text": "In AD patients, APOE genotype affects the cholinergic system in an allele-specific manner, such that E4 is associated with decreased neuronal activity in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM; Salehi et al., 1998) and reduced choline acetyltransferase activity in the cortex and hippocampus compared with E2 and E3 (Lai et al., 2006;Poirier et al., 1995). In AD the activity of the nicotinic 42 receptor is altered both in terms of reduced binding and subunit expression (Burghaus et al., 2000;Martin-Ruiz et al., 1999, 2000), and reduced nicotinic receptor availability has been reported in MCI (Terriere et al., 2010). Discrete reductions in uptake were found in the medial temporal cortex. Kadir et al. (2006) used PET molecular imaging to show that mean 11C-nicotine binding in the frontal and parietal cortices of mild AD patients is associated with performance in neuropsychological assessments of attention but not memory. Using probabilistic maps of the cholinergic structures in the basal forebrain, Grothe et al. (2010) found that the volume of the nbM was significantly reduced in MCI patients. In addition, volumes of different magnocellular compartments correlated significantly with regional gray matter atrophy in regions known to be affected by AD. This is consistent with the finding that AD brains show cell loss in the nbM complex, with the greatest loss in the posterior section of the nbM. This section innervates the temporal cortex, which shows marked loss of cholinergic fiber density in AD (Geula and Mesulam, 1996). Haense et al. (2012) used PET to study acetylcholinesterase activity in MCI and found that the temporal lobe manifestation of cholinergic impairment is prominent at early stages of dementia and is significantly related to verbal and nonverbal memory, language comprehension and executive function. Hall et al. (2008) searched for presymptomatic markers in asymptomatic subjects who later developed AD, and observed atrophy of the basal forebrain as long as 4.5 years before symptom onset.\nThese studies show that changes in cholinergic brain structures and receptor functions are found in early stages of dementia (MCI), and are correlated with cognitive functions. Most clinical studies have not included APOE genotype as a moderator, possibly based on the view that cholinergic deficit is only found in advanced dementia. The studies cited above contradict this view.",

    "Vascular disease and vascular dementia": {
      "text": "Cerebrovascular disease in the aged brain may take the form of cerebral atherosclerosis, small vessel disease or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; Grinberg and Thal, 2010). Whereas APOE E4 as a risk factor for atherosclerosis is characterized by Grinberg and Thal (2010) as controversial, an association of E4 with risk of small vessel disease has been reported (Yip et al., 2005). Thal et al. (2002) describe two types of CAA: type 1 is characterized by amyloid deposition in cortical capillaries, while type 2 exhibits amyloid deposits in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels, with the exception of cortical capillaries. The frequency of the E4 allele is more than 4 times greater in CAA type 1 than in CAA type 2 cases and controls. In less advanced stages, CAA may lead to blood flow changes without tissue damage (Thal et al., 2009). The sporadic form of CAA with capillary deposits of amyloid  is strongly associated with AD and APOE E4. Thal et al. (2010) state that AD cases with capillary CAA differ significantly from other AD cases both genetically and morphologically, thereby pointing to a specific capillary CAA-related and APOE E4-associated subtype of AD.\nIn an autopsy series of cognitively normal persons aged 60 years and older, Caselli et al. (2010) found that E4 was associated with increased plaque burden and increased CAA in all brain subregions. Jones et al. (2011) studied selected candidate genes, including APOE, as risk factors for vascular dementia, a heterogeneous condition caused by reduced brain blood supply. In autopsy-confirmed cases, an association was found between APOE E4 and mixed dementia (AD with concurrent cerebrovascular disease). Concurrent cerebrovascular disease (in the form of infarcts) is found in 40 of patients with AD, but the incidence of CAA in AD is even higher (Thal et al., 2010). In a population-based study in which the Petersen criteria of MCI were applied (Petersen et al., 1999), white matter hyperintensities were more strongly associated with amnestic MCI, whereas infarcts were more strongly associated with non-amnestic MCI (Luchsinger et al., 2009).",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Previous studies have sought to clarify the role of APOE genotype by contrasting cognitively normal and cognitively impaired participants, mainly in the older age range. Based on the studies reviewed above we conclude that this strategy is unlikely to yield consistent results. Because of the interaction of APOE E4 with amyloid  accumulation in both cognitively pre-symptomatic and symptomatic groups, a distinction needs to be made between APOE effects in amyloid-negative, amyloid-positive asymptomatic, and amyloidpositive symptomatic groups. In young or middle-aged healthy amyloid-negative adults, APOE E4 carrier status is associated with subtle changes in brain functional and structural connectivity, and in metabolic functions. E4 carriers may have an increased incidence of reduced blood flow in cerebral capillaries. Cholinergic function affecting cognition may be subtly reduced or qualitatively altered in genetic subgroups, but reduction can most likely only be shown in experimental tasks of attention or working memory. Hippocampal volume may be reduced even in babies with the E4 allele, but the evidence that E4 is associated with hippocampal volume is significantly weakened by a recent meta-analysis of GWAS data from 17 different cohorts (Stein et al., 2012). Also, recent MR studies of a large group of men aged 50-59 years showed frontal rather than temporal or hippocampal effects (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2011).\nSeveral studies including our own indicate that the E4 effect on fiber quality and white matter microstructure is not age-dependent and thus predates amyloid accumulation. While emphasizing that the exact biological correlates of diffusion anisotropy are unclear (Wheeler-Kingshott and Cercignani, 2009), we interpret the effects of APOE on DTI-derived white matter microstructure as myelin-related because of the increased radial diffusivity in E4 carriers. This is also biologically plausible given the role of the ApoE protein in lipid transport. However, we find it difficult to distinguish between primary myelination and myelin repair processes, since these involve similar biological mechanisms (Fancy et al., 2011). Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that axonal and synaptic changes are also present, since myelination is partly activity-dependent (Fancy et al., 2011). The presence of E4 compromises cerebral connectivity as evidenced by altered white matter microstructural properties and functional integration of resting state networks, including the default mode network. Changes in mitochondrial function affecting energy metabolism have also been described in PET studies and in gene expression studies of cerebral tissue.\nThe cognitive correlates of these biological phenotypes are insufficiently explored, but white matter microstructural integrity has been associated with behavioral stability as indexed by trialby-trial reaction time variability in both young and adult samples (Fjell et al., 2011;Tamnes et al., 2012) and age-related reduction in performance on cognitive tests demanding attention or working memory functions (Madden et al., 2009). In an older study group (mean age 72 years), Penke et al. (2012) showed that a processing speed factor common to a number of cognitive tests was strongly related to a general white matter fiber integrity factor. Similarly, Salami et al. (2012) found that white matter microstructure mediated age-related reductions in processing speed but not episodic memory, visuospatial abilities, or verbal fluency.\nTogether, the findings reviewed above indicate that E4 is a vulnerability factor and not a pathogenic factor at ages where cerebral diseases or injuries are infrequent. This is not to deny that pathogenic factors that interact with APOE genotype (amyloid  accumulation, cholinergic dysfunction) may not be found in younger groups, but their frequency or intensity is not sufficient to result in an interaction of APOE genotype with age, suggesting that the unique genotypic effects on the various biological, brain and cognitive phenotypes are relatively invariant with age in healthy subjects.\nThese conclusions differ from those of earlier reviews and meta-analyses (Cherbuin et al., 2007;Wisdom et al., 2011). One reason may be that many previous studies comprised mainly older participants who were pre-symptomatic and had unknown amyloid status. Another reason is that earlier studies may have had a selective focus guided by the general assumption that since memory deficit is the cognitive hallmark of AD, and hippocampus atrophy is the neuroimaging hallmark, these traits should also be present in E4 carriers in preclinical groups. We suggest that they appear at a later stage of AD pathological evolution because of interaction between E4 and other pathological factors. In light of recent findings that a significant proportion of middle-aged asymptomatic individuals are PiB-positive or have pathological CSF levels of amyloid  (Morris et al., 2010), a distinction should be made between asymptomatic (amyloid-positive) and healthy (amyloid-negative) individuals. In the absence of positive evidence, only cognitively normal individuals below the age of 40-50 can be assumed to be amyloid-negative. The traits characterizing E4 effects as such in amyloid-negative groups are not disease-specific and are qualitatively different from those found in AD.\nThe methods for quantifying amyloid  accumulation in vivo have only recently become available on a large scale. Pike et al. (2011) compared 58 amyloid-positive cognitively intact persons with amyloid-negative controls and found a significant interaction of amyloid burden and APOE status relative to visuospatial function. The amyloid-positive group also had poorer memory and higher incidence of APOE E4. The study by Kantarci et al. (2012) further supports the conclusion that amyloid load and APOE interact in influencing magnitude and profile of pre-clinical cognitive changes and risk of further cognitive decline (Villemagne et al., 2011). The stage at which this decline is sufficient to elicit a clinical classification of MCI depends on criteria that vary between studies (Stephan et al., 2012).\nWhen individuals progress to develop MCI and AD, APOE E4 interacts with other pathological factors to drive and shape this process. Most potent among these factors is accumulation of amyloid , which biases the pathological course of events toward AD. It is possible that poorer quality of myelination in E4 carriers increases vulnerability to amyloid accumulation (Braak and Braak, 1997) although the mechanism is unknown. Mahley and Huang (2009) postulate the necessity of pathological factors in addition to amyloid accumulation (second hit) in order to trigger AD. There is evidence that tau accumulation is critical for initiating a further pathological course (Hyman, 2011), and there are indications that APOE E4 does not affect tau-related mechanisms (Desikan et al., in press;Morris et al., 2010). Nevertheless, several APOE-related mechanisms may still influence the course of pathological development.\nAllelic variation in cholinergic genes or other factors leading to reduced receptor efficiency may be a contributing factor, as may any neurotraumatic event that increases demand for neuronal repair (Herrup, 2010). Other susceptibility alleles, as yet unknown but enriched in individuals with a family history of AD, may also affect disease progression. APOE E4 in association with having a first degree relative with AD indicates risk of memory decline from age 60 or before (Caselli et al., 2009). Increased cortical PiB binding was observed in E4 carriers over 55 with a family history of AD (Xiong et al., 2011).\nSince E4 is associated with several cerebrovascular risk factors, and especially with reduced cerebral capillary circulation as seen in CAA, E4 carriers are more likely to develop a form of MCI, and later AD, with significant vascular components. E4 carrier status is associated with a clinical cognitive phenotype with significant episodic memory deficit (amnestic MCI) and higher risk of conversion to AD (Wolk and Dickerson, 2010). These patients also show volume reduction of the hippocampus on MR scans as well as widespread, mainly posterior, cortical thinning (Whitwell et al., 2007). Amyloid accumulation accelerated by APOE E4 and oligomer toxicity directly affecting neurons are widely believed to be causal mechanisms. This is contradicted by Desikan et al. (in press), who find that entorhinal cortical atrophy occurs only in the presence of reduced CSF phosphorylated tau. The hippocampal region is not a site of early amyloid accumulation as demonstrated by both pathological (Braak and Braak, 1997;Price et al., 1991) and PET biomarker data (Aizenstein et al., 2008). The hippocampus is highly vulnerable to circulatory failure, as evidenced by hippocampal damage and amnesia in anoxic conditions and temporary circulatory arrest (Horstmann et al., 2010) or chronic hypoperfusion (Cechetti et al., 2012). Thal et al. (2010) have argued for an E4-related AD subtype, and suggested that clinical AD is not the end result of a single, sequentially unfolding process. Cholinergic deficits are more likely to affect the temporal lobe (Haense et al., 2012) but it has not yet been shown directly that these deficits are accentuated in E4 carriers.\nThe conclusions of this review are consistent with theories of AD development allowing for heterogenous mechanisms, such as those proposed by (Herrup, 2010) and implied in the criteria for defining an AD pathophysiological process as proposed by Sperling et al. (2011). Our conclusions deviate from a strict version of the cascade model of Jack et al. (2010) in two ways. Firstly, in relation to the role of APOE genotype in the AD pathophysiological process, we conclude that the cascade model is oversimplified. While acknowledging amyloid  as a highly significant pathological factor at initial stages of disease, we find that there is a high degree of diversity of APOE-related pathological mechanisms, affecting the rate and biomarker profile of clinical development. Secondly, subtle MR and cognitive markers are detectable early in the development of the pathophysiological process that render E4 carriers vulnerable to MCI and AD, but they are not watered-down versions of the changes seen in clinical AD, such as hippocampal atrophy and memory deficit.",

How does APOE E4 increase the risk of early disease presentation?\nThe well-documented ability of E4 to accelerate and possibly induce amyloid  accumulation is the most likely mechanism. Subtle pre-symptomatic changes in brain myelination, brain morphology and cognitive functions may render E4 carriers more vulnerable (Bartzokis, 2011). 2. Why do some carriers of E4 not develop AD?\nA second hit by another age-associated pathological factor must be present in addition to amyloid  accumulation. This factor may be unrelated to APOE genotype, e.g. tauopathy, or only weakly associated with E4, such as any process placing increasing demand on neuronal repair.",

      "text": "and what are the underlying mechanisms? There are APOE-dependent effects throughout the lifespan, with a crucial difference between early and late effects. The distinction is marked by the time point of significant amyloid  accumulation (about 50-60 years) and not by age in itself. Myelination, metabolic function, cholinergic receptor activity, and vascular capillary function (blood flow) are the most relevant mechanisms in the early phase. In PiB-positive individuals, APOE interacts with amyloid  to determine a cognitive and neurodegenerative pattern that is further accentuated in MCI. 4. Which biomarkers are most sensitive to ApoE-related mechanisms? Accumulation of amyloid  in brain, as measured with an amyloid-specific ligand, and CSF is increased in E4 carriers. MRI brain imaging studies have consistently shown E4-related effects on measures of white matter microstructure and functional connectivity between brain regions. Measures of cortical and subcortical atrophy have shown more variable results, perhaps because of differences in sample characteristics. There is no evidence that any of these markers are specific to APOE. 5. Are there clinical phenotypes specifically related to APOE genotype? Biomarkers may combine to define a complex phenotype. Besides memory problems, individuals with amnestic MCI show a pattern of hippocampal atrophy and increased risk of developing AD. This group has a high proportion of E4 carriers. AD with associated vascular disease (CAA) is the best candidate for status as an E4-specific AD phenotype.\nAs the number of long-term longitudinal population studies continues to increase, it is important to cast the net widely to detect early effects of APOE genotype on imaging and cognitive phenotypes. Careful observation of these early markers will be important for developing treatment strategies targeted toward APOE-related mechanisms (Mahley and Huang, 2009).",

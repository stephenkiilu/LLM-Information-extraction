    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to examine the microstructural integrity of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD). Significant frontal, temporal, and parietal white matter diffusion tensor changes were demonstrated in MCI and AD compared with normal controls. These changes were correlated with cognitive functioning, and are consistent with a hypothesized loss of axonal processes in affected regions.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) have largely focused on the brains cortical gray matter. Although pathoanatomical and imaging studies have confirmed both microscopic and macroscopic white matter changes (WMC) in patients with AD and MCI, controversy exists regarding the relevance of WMC, the pathogenic mechanisms producing WMC, and the association of WMC with cognitive dysfunction. 1 The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique provides increased sensitivity for detecting ultrastructural abnormalities of white matter in vivo. 2 Previous studies suggest that the pattern of white matter diffusion changes, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), water diffusivity parallel to axonal fibers (axial diffusivity: DA), and water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fibers (radial diffusivity: DR), can be used to examine the underlying mechanisms of WMC secondary to myelin damage or axonal loss (e.g., as in Wallerian degeneration). 3,4 In this study, we hypothesized that DTI would detect microstructural changes in areas of normal appearing white matter on traditional MR images, in MCI and early AD. We further hypothesized that these changes would correlate with measures of cognitive dysfunction.",

      "text": "Elderly subjects with normal cognition (n  6), MCI (n  8), and mild AD (n  4) were recruited from the Alzheimers Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). All MCI subjects met Petersen et al.s criteria for amnestic MCI. 5 All AD subjects met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke-Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)s criteria for possible or probable AD. 6 Results of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) Neuropsychological Battery with Trail-making Test 7 examined within 1 year from enrollment were obtained from the ADRC database (TABLE 1). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of CWRU. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.",

    "MRI Acquisition Protocol": {

    "DTI Processing": {
      "text": "DTI dataset processing was performed using DTI Studio (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD http:cmrm.med.jhmi.edu). From 12 apparent diffusion coefficient maps, the maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and three eigenvalues ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) were determined. Normal appearing white matter (NAWM) was defined by normal signal intensity on standard T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted, and FLAIR images. Regions of interest (ROI) were placed bilaterally on images acquired without diffusion gradients (b  0 smm 2 ). Small oval ROIs of 916 pixels (31.6456.25 mm 2 ) were placed in the frontal, temporal, and parietal NAWM with 5 contiguous slices, and in the normal appearing occipital white matter with 3 contiguous slices. ROIs were then superimposed in identical slices on different tensor maps. FA, radial diffusivity ( 2  3 2), and axial diffusivity ( 1 ) for each ROI were recorded. For each subject, the measures of FA, DA, and DR were averaged across all the slices of each white matter area bilaterally.",

    "RESULTS": {
      "text": "There were no significant differences in age, gender, and educational level between the three groups. Compared with normal controls, AD subjects scored significantly poorer on most cognitive tests, while MCI subjects demonstrated less degrees of cognitive impairment. (See TABLE 1).\nCompared to normal controls, MCI subjects demonstrated decreased FA (P  0.008) and decreased DA (P  0.01) in temporal NAWM, while AD subjects demonstrated decreased FA (P  0.01), decreased DA (P  0.01), and increased DR (P  0.01) (See TABLE 2). In parietal NAWM, MCI showed decreased FA (P  0.001), increased DR (P  0.003), and AD showed increased DR (P  0.01), compared to normal controls. AD also showed significantly increased DR (P  0.04) in frontal NAWM compared to normal controls. Neither MCI nor AD showed any significant differences in diffusion tensor changes in occipital NAWM versus normal controls.\nSince the MCI and AD groups did not differ from each other on any diffusion tensor measurement, we combined the two groups for correlation analyses with cognitive test results. Temporal NAWM diffusion measurements were significantly correlated with episodic memory (WLM with DR: r s  -0.68, P  0.03; WLDR with FA: r s  0.66, P  0.04; WLDR with DR: r s  -0.77, P  0.009). Frontal WM diffusion measurements were significantly correlated with both episodic memory and executive function (WLM with DR: r s  -0.70, P  0.03; WLM with DA: r s  -0.75, P  0.01; WLDR with FA: r s  0.65, P  0.04; WLDR with DR: r s  -0.77, P  0.01; TMA with DA: r s  0.75, P  0.01; TMA with DR: r s  0.69, P  0.03). Parietal WM DR was significantly correlated with general cognition as measured by MMSE total scores (r s  -0.66, P  0.04).",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, we found evidence suggesting microstructural white matter changes in early AD and MCI in NAWM. These changes were present in brain regions serving higher cortical functions (temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes), but not in regions serving primary functions (occipital lobe). These findings are consistent with several previous DTI investigations that reported changes of anisotropy or diffusivities in the white matter of temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes. 8910 The correlation between DTI parameters and cognitive functioning has not been analyzed comprehensively, although a few reports have demonstrated that performances in general cognition (MMSE) as well as delayed verbal recall test correlated significantly with changes of anisotropy and diffusivity of selected white matter regions. 8,11 This study confirmed previous observations and provided further specific information that the diffusion tensor abnormalities demonstrated in different brain white matter regions were associated with different cognitive dysfunction, for example, temporal diffusion tensor changes were correlated with episodic memory, frontal diffusion tensor changes were correlated with executive function and episodic memory, while parietal diffusion tensor changes were correlated with general cognition. These correlations suggested that the damage of white matter integrity might contribute to the loss of connectivity between different cortical functional regions in AD patients.\nThe pathogenic mechanisms of microscopic white matter damage in AD and MCI are unclear. Our results show that, in NAWM of the temporal lobe, the diffusivity parallel to the white matter fibers (DA) is significantly decreased, while diffusivity perpendicular to the white matter fibers (DR) is significantly increased in AD subjects. This pattern of diffusion change is characteristically observed with axon-related pathologies (e.g., as in Wallerian degeneration). 3 In contrast, myelin-related pathologies produce increased DR without changing DA. 4 However, we did not reveal similar patterns of diffusion changes in other brain regions, even though the parietal NAWM DA was also decreased compared with normal controls with borderline significance in the MCI group (P  0.07). We may argue that because the pathology burden (especially neuronal loss) in other brain regions is not as severe as in the temporal lobe of MCI or early AD subjects, the typical diffusion features of Wallerian degeneration may not be detectable with our small sample size. And also, the pattern of diffusion change secondary to myelin-related or axon-related mechanisms also depends strongly on the preexisting regional architecture of white matter as well as other factors (e.g., vascular ischemic mechanism) that may change the amount and directional diffusivities of tissue water. 3 This preliminary study suggested that DTI is a promising technique to identify microstructural white matter damage of AD and to test the hypothesis that Wallerian degeneration may be an important mechanism underlying these pathological changes.",

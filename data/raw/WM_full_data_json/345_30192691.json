    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of dementia. The changes in white matter integrity and antioxidant enzymes levels are crucial in onset and progression to Alzheimers disease (AD). To elucidate the changes in cognitive performance, white matter integrity, oxidative stress marker, for early detection of prodromal state of AD. Fifty cases of MCI and controls (55-75 years) were subjected to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) followed by estimation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation in serum of MCI and control population. The MMSE scores of MCI subjects were (28  2-22.6  1) as compared with controls (28  1-29  1). DTI metrics fractional anisotropy (FA) values in right and left frontal lobe, fornix, corpus callosum, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in right temporal lobe, hippocampus head, corpus callosum right, and forcep major were significantly altered in MCI as compared with controls. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels were lower while lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased in patients with MCI as compared with controls. The study emphasized that changes in neuro-psychological performance, white matter integrity, and antioxidant enzymes level provide early signature for diagnosis of MCI.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Alzheimers dementia (AD) is normally preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI can be defined as the transitional state between healthy aging and very mild Alzheimers disease, and therefore, it has become a focal point for clinical research 1,2. Although, MCI can be presented with multiple symptoms but memory complaint is one of the predominant symptoms, and addressed as amnestic MCI (aMCI). The average rate of conversion of these MCI subject to probably AD is about 10-15 as compared with 1-2 of normal aging individuals 3. White matter (WM) change may complement grey matter as evident by study that combination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cortical thickness has higher sensitivity and specificity to differentiate amnestic MCI from healthy control 4. The recent finding on WM damage in AD postmortem tissues, WM signal abnormalities, and volumetric reduction in MRI findings provide strong rational for understanding WM changes in AD 4567. The common measurement of DTI is overall assessment of diffusivity of water molecules, through diffusion tensor and is known as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), while anisotropy is calculated by fractional anisotropy (FA) 8,9. Therefore, it is an important neuroimaging tool employed for detail investigation of the microstructures and integrity of WM fiber tracts 8,9. The FA and ADC values of DTI in neurological disorder are influenced by various factors such as myelination, axon density, axonal membrane integrity, axonal diameter and intravoxel coherence of fiber orientation 10,11. The clinical progression of MCI to AD can be specifically delineated by study of WM changes as evident by results of various studies 10,11. There is great interest in identification of predictors of dementia in people with MCI, because some people with MCI progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function 12. The preliminary screening of elderly population can be done through Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) best known screening tool for overall assessment of cognitive impairment in clinical, research, and community setting 12. The role of oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis is well established 13. The oxidative stress begin early in progression of AD and provide potential target for therapeutic and biomarker identification 14. The accumulation of product of free radical damage in tissues of central and peripheral nervous system of AD and MCI subject was already reported 15,16. The status of various antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione-S-tranferase (GST), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been found to be downregulated while marker of lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde are found to be elevated in AD subjects 14,17. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate changes in cognitive performance, WM integrity, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation level in serum of elderly population for early identification of MCI subjects (Table 1).",

The image analysis was performed in presence of expert neurologist and Radiologist. The senior radiologists, however, evaluated and reported the DTI data prior to viewing the routine MR imaging, to exclude any kind of observer bias. The data were evaluated in two steps: First, a random eyeball evaluation of the DTI color maps RGB maps and the T1 weighted image map was done; second, a semi-quantitative evaluation of the same images was done to pre-identify areas of asymmetry of color saturation and hue. These were done for guiding and correlating\nwith the quantitative analysis, which was the final aim of this study. Finally, quantitative analysis of FA and ADC maps, generated automatically by the propriety software, was done by drawing region of interest (ROI) in the interactive maps, to include the WM tracts emanating from the most functionally active areas in the brain. The diameter of 3 mm was used for each ROI and an average of three consecutive values at the same point was registered.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The neuropsychological analysis of MCI subjects showed significant difference in orientation, immediate recall, attention, 3-step command, delayed recall, naming, reading and comprehension, writing, copy design, when assessed on MMSE test. The MMSE score of MCI subjects in age group 65-75 yr was less as compared with 55-60 yr age group, which might be due to lower number of education years and higher percentage of individuals from rural community (Table 2). The increase in cognitive dysfunction in older age group was in agreement with the previous study, where subjects 70 yr or above had higher subjective dysfunction on recent and past memories in comparison to 60-65 yr age group 19. Community-based studies had shown the association of education bias on cognitive performance that supports the findings of our study also indicates that lower number of education years decreases cognitive dysfunction 19. The changes in FA values in frontal lobe, forcep major, fornix, and corpus callosum regions of MCI subject directly influences the neuropsychological performance such as composite memory, long-term retrieval, free recall, abstract thinking, 3 step command functions of brains in MCI subjects as compared with age matched controls. The decrease in FA value in MCI subjects and its influences on neuropsychological performance has been well established in previous studies 20,21. The changes in memory and cognitive symptoms of MCI subjects in our study were mainly related to changes in microstructural WM damage. The study of Stricker et al. depicted that decrease in WM integrity was related to cognition and is independent of cortical thinning 22. The studies reported lower FA value in splenium of corpus callosum as compared with control 23,24. The decrease in FA value of fornix associated with corpus callosum of MCI subjects in the current study depicts the linkage of age associated decline in WM integrity. The changes in WM pattern were due to myelin degeneration, which might be variable in different regions of brain leading to age related difference in FA. In our study, we obtained similar decrease in FA value in regions of brain that mainly connect grey matter, degeneration of myelin in the respected regions of brain resulted in lowering of FA value and Studies have shown that the decrease of FA value in anterior-posterior gradient implies such brain areas which were highly myelinated are more susceptible for degeneration as observed in the current study 24. Although, study conducted by Sulvian et al. proposed that age-related decline in FA value were mainly prominent in centrum semiovale and corticospinal tract 25. Although, studies have proved that regions of brain which myelinate fully are most vulnerable to negative effect of aging, which might be due to oligodendrocytes of associative WM pathway where most active cells are prone to metabolic damage 26. There were different theories mainly anterior-posterior and superior-inferior gradient theory suggested that damage within WM pathways decreases the efficiency of communications among widely distributed neural system comprising cognition, which lead to a disconnection of cognitive network 2728293031. The increases in ADC value in elderly population in different brain regions have been well reported 323334. The increase in ADC value in our study in the regions of right temporal lobe, hippocampus head, corpus callosum right, and forcep major was significantly high in MCI subjects as compared with age matched control (Figure 1(A,B)). The increase in ADC value might be due to severe fiber degeneration that leads to decreased tract volume and increase isotropic diffusivity through partial volume effect of surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The age-related increase in radial diffusivity (RD) is the signature of demyelination and is also represented in animal models 34353637. The changes in hippocampus volume are critical to episodic memory functions 38. The changes observed in ADC value of hippocampus head was in cohesion with the finding of Persson et al. in which the age-related episodic memory deficits were strongly correlated with WM alteration in hippocampal connections 39. The increase in ADC value of forcep major was mainly due to the loss of myelin which is consistent with histological findings of age-related loss of myelin and myelinated fibers in old age 404142. The loss of myelin and axon in corpus callosum increases the extracellular volume fraction and lower membrane density, which increases axonal spacing and reduced extracellular tortuosity 42,43. The contradictory results are available for variable level of antioxidant enzyme in neurodegenerative disorders 44. In this study, we observed decrease in SOD and GPX level in MCI individuals. SODs reduce molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide(H 2 O 2) produced at physiological level from respiratory chain 45. The decrease in SOD and GPX activity in MCI subject as compared with control might result in accumulation of H 2 O 2 , which react with lipid and protein resulting in cellular damage 46. The increase in lipid peroxidation in MCI subject in our study is in agreement with previous studies, showing progressive increase of MDA in MCI and AD 47. The decrease in antioxidant enzymes and increase in lipid peroxidation might play significant role in conversion of MCI subject to prodromal AD 47.\nThe findings of our study signifies that changes in cognitive functions, WM integrity and antioxidant enzyme level could provide very significant marker for early identification of MCI subjects which are at high risk of developing AD in near future.",

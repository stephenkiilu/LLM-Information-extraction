    "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD) is both common and disabling and doubles the risk of dementia onset. Apathy might constitute an additional risk of cognitive decline but clear understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking. While white matter (WM) alterations have been assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this model cannot accurately represent WM microstructure. We hypothesized that a more complex multi-compartment model would provide new biomarkers of LLD and apathy. Fifty-six individuals (LLD n  35, 26 females, 75.2  6.4 years, apathy evaluation scale scores (41.8  8.7) and Healthy controls, n  21, 16 females, 74.7  5.2 years) were included. In this article, a tract-based approach was conducted to investigate novel diffusion model biomarkers of LLD and apathy by interpolating microstructural metrics directly along the fiber bundle. We performed multivariate statistical analysis, combined with principal component analysis for dimensional data reduction. We then tested the utility of our framework by demonstrating classically reported from the literature modifications in LDD while reporting new results of biological-basis of apathy in LLD. Finally, we aimed to investigate the relationship between apathy and microstructure in different fiber bundles. Our study suggests that new fiber bundles, such as the striato-premotor tracts, may be involved in LLD and apathy, which bring new light of apathy mechanisms in major depression. We also identified statistical changes in diffusion MRI metrics in 5 different tracts, previously reported in major cognitive disorders dementia, suggesting that these alterations among these tracts are both involved in motivation and cognition and might explain how apathy is a prodromal phase of degenerative disorders.",

The CUSP acquisition time was 6.42 min. An additional b 0 volume with reversed phase encoding direction volume was also acquired with the same acquisition parameter for the distortion artifact correction. The specificity of this sequence lies in its 60 gradients that are placed on a sphere and a cube (i.e. with multiple gradient b-values ranging from 1000 to 3000 s mm -1 ). The goal of this particular gradient structure is to reduce the acquisition time compared to a regular multi-shell sequence while maintaining the quality of the resulting diffusion model 28 . Moreover, the second interest of the CUSP sequence is in terms of image quality because the time echo of this diffusion sequence is less affected by high b-values, improving the signal-to-noise of the images.",

    "Diffusion model": {
      "text": "In MCMs, the diffusion signal is modeled as the sum of the contributions from different compartments. Each of them represents a specific tissue (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, or axons in a specific direction) with a specific diffusion property. Water diffusion within spherical structures, such as specific glial cells or neuronal cell bodies, and free water diffusion, such as cerebrospinal fluid, could be expressed as isotropic compartments.\nThe intra-axonal and extra-axonal space, corresponding to the complex environment composed of glial cells and extracellular molecules, could be represented as anisotropic compartments. The water diffusion probability density function (PDF) is then expressed as the sum of the isotropic and anisotropic compartments:\nwhere p i and q j are the diffusion PDFs of respectively the i-th isotropic compartment, and the j-th anisotropic compartment of the model. The parameters, α i and β j , are the compartment weights of the model and sum up to 1. Assuming Gaussian compartmental diffusion, the most complete microstructure mapping is given by the multi-tensor model (MTM) 31 where each anisotropic compartment is characterized by its diffusion tensor. Contrary to the classical NODDI model, in order to address the crossing fiber, a MTM with several anisotropic zeppelin compartments (i.e a tensor whose last 2 eigenvalues are equal) is performed, to account for multiple fiber bundles with different directions in the same voxel. Some brain areas are better explained by different numbers of anisotropic compartments: no anisotropic compartment for the CSF, one anisotropic compartment for the corpus callosum, and two or three anisotropic compartments in complex crossing fiber areas contrary to classical MCMs where this number is fixed. A method has been proposed to detect the region of crossing fibers based on the planar index (the difference of the last two eigenvalues of the tensor) 18 , but by construction, it has been designed to detect an area of 2 crossing fibers and not optimal for 3 crossing fibers. To detect the optimal number of anisotropic compartments from 0 to 3 for each voxel individually, we performed an automatic pipeline using model averaging theory 32 . A representation of the number of anisotropic compartments, each of them corresponding to a fiber population is shown in the next section. After testing a MCM with different isotropic compartments, we only included a free water compartment, based on the model estimation error. In this study, even with very high-quality data, this model is too complex to allow a stable resolution with two isotropic water compartments. To summarize, for each voxel, our model includes one isotropic compartment (free water) and k anisotropic zeppelin compartments whose number (from 0 to 3) is fixed by the automatic pipeline described previously.\nThe estimation of the MTM is based on a comprehensive maximum likelihood framework 31 that jointly features estimators of compartment proportions and diffusion-related parameters. In addition, to ensure a smoother MTM, a prior on the parameters was defined to estimate the model in a reasonable time (  2h per subject with 8 cores), using the BOBYQA optimizer. From the MCM proposed in this paper, several microstructure metrics can be calculated among which the weight of the free water compartment FW. The other metrics are derived individually for each k-ith anisotropic compartment of the voxel ( FA k , mean diffusivity MD k , axial diffusivity AD k and radial diffusivity RD k ) and then average to give a scalar measure (FA, MD, AD and RD).",

      "text": "In parallel, automatic WM tract segmentation was performed for each subject using the openly available TractSeg tool 33 , which is based on a fully convolutional neural network that directly segments WM tract infields of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks and was pretrained on high-quality dMRI data acquired for the Human Connectome Project. TractSeg was run on the preprocessed dMRI data after rigid alignment in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space. This process was applied to our dataset resulting in 72 bundles for each subject. Based on the previous studies focusing on LLD or apathy 34,35 , only 29 bundles of interest were selected and classified into five groups: Then, for each bundle of a given subject, a centroid line was computed as the mean streamline of the path using the minimum-distance-flipped metric 36 and then resampled to s  100 equidistant segments. Each voxel is weighted by its relative geodesic distance to the nearest centroid point so that spurious streamlines far from the centroid do not affect the result 20 . Each microstructure value, corresponding to the average of the different anisotropic compartments of each vertex was then projected on the centroid line, using a cKDTree algorithm 37 . A bundle profile containing 5 averaged MCM-derived microstructure metrics FW, FA, MD, AD and RD over the (1)\ndifferent anisotropic compartments was then generated for each tract. This protocol has the advantage of being applied directly in the subjects space, taking into account the entire white matter bundle, and being adaptable to any individual variations such as brain size.",

A correlation analysis between the 5 microstructure metrics was performed to remove measures with correlation scores higher than 0.8 and to avoid instability in the statistical analysis 38 . To reduce possible redundancy and to explore the complementarity of each measure, a PCA was performed on each bundle profile. We selected the number of principal components (PCs) (L) that generated a cumulative explained variance of 80. Then, a multivariate group analysis was performed between the HC and LLD groups, point by point along each bundle. We conducted a two-sample Hotellings T2, which is a generalization of the Students t-statistic used in multivariate hypothesis testing, between the L PCs of the two groups. Prior to this analysis, the influence of covariates (age, sex and center) was removed by performing a linear regression. Cohens d effect sizes were calculated from the group comparison analysis. Using the same framework, we also tested the correlation between the AES score and the PCs along the tracts within the LLD group, using a linear model with age, sex and center as covariates. And we also reported the r score for indexing the effect size. For both analyses, all the results were corrected for multiple comparisons with a non-parametric permutation approach 39 . The data were permuted by shuffling the subjects labels and then calculating differences in the metric between the permuted groups for each permutation. This process was repeated 10.000 times, and the distribution of differences under the null hypothesis was constructed based on the permuted data. For each bundle, the family-wise error rate (FWE) corrected cluster size is reported, which means that significant clusters of this size or larger exceed the multiple comparison threshold and do not require further adjustment of the p-value.",

The number of fascicles was fixed equal to 3 to obtain the same number of anisotropic compartments, necessary for averaging. However, for the rest of the analyses, the number of anisotropic compartments was computed automatically. As expected, we observed areas with no anisotropic compartment such as in the CSF, areas with only one direction such as in corpus callosum and areas with 2 or 3 different directions near the centrum semiovale (see Fig. 1). This area is a major challenge for diffusion models because three major pathways (CC, CST and Arcuate Fasciculus) are crossing almost orthogonally in the most ventral part. An average of 2.59  0.45 anisotropic compartments for each voxel was calculated in the HC group (see Fig. 2). More specifically, in the linear part of the CST, an average number of anisotropic compartments equal to 1.2 was estimated in the HC group.

We performed a cross-correlation analysis between the different measures on the 29 bundles. Figure 4 displays the correlation and standard deviation measures averaged over the 29 bundles. The average FA over the anisotropic compartments (from 0 to 3) is strongly correlated to the average RD ( r  -0.80 ). However, as different numbers of anisotropic compartments are included in the diffusion model, we found a lower similarity between the other metrics calculated on the anisotropic compartments as well as with the free water. As displayed in Fig. 3, for ATR left, we observed along the fiber bundle specific and uncorrelated patterns for each microstructure metric.\nIn the analysis including the LLD and HC, PCA results show that 80 of the variability in the data is accounted for 20 bundles by the first two PCs and 9 by only one PC. For example, for the ATR left (see Fig. 3), the first PC explains 70.8 of the variance and is composed of FA and FW contributing for the first metric negatively (72) and the second positively (68).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "In this study, we combined multiple advances in diffusion imaging to better characterize microstructure in LLD and to better characterize apathy in LLD. Instead of averaging measurements over the entire fiber, we opted for a local approach by slicing the fiber bundle into subsections to obtain finer regions of interest. As explained in 42 , tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber bundle may provide new insights into brain-behavior associations that are not apparent from average measures of that tract. Finally, the tract-based approach has the advantage of being carried out directly in the subject space thereby reducing biases associated with nonlinear registration, required when using a voxel-based approach.\nIn this study, we also performed a MCM, to derive more interpretable measures of WM integrity and inflammation in LLD that could not be obtained with a classical DTI model. Indeed, the DTI model cannot correctly represent complex brain areas such as crossing fibers, unlike an MCM estimated with multiple anisotropic compartments. In fact, all diffusion models that do not include multiple anisotropic compartments, including more complex models such as CHARMED or NODDI, cannot correctly represent a crossing fiber by their very construction. As shown in Fig. 1, our model with multiple anisotropic compartments (from 0 to 3) can robustly estimate crossing fibers near the central oval, like the SLF, and we can accurately probe the tissue microstructure in this pathway.\nSeveral studies have assessed the potential advantages of MCMs over DTI in predicting age andor cognitive performance 434445 . Results from these studies have suggested that metrics derived from multi-compartment models may be more sensitive predictors of age andor cognitive performance in older adults 43,44,46 . Notably, most studies have focused on WM across the brain andor explored individual WM tracts that form parts of multiple cognitive networks 43,45,47 .\nIn addition to more accurate ROI detection, MCMs also offer improved microstructural interpretation. When an increase in the free water compartment is observed in one group relative to another, this offers a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying microstructure, such as the presence of inflammation, rather than merely detecting a change in FA in the DTI model, the interpretation of which is more susceptible to question. It is important to note that DTI FA is not specific to microstructure. A decrease could be related to edema, axonal injury, or demyelination. The significant fiber areas estimated in the correlation analysis using PCs are highlighted with red dots. Bottom row: Illustration of the 5 bundles corresponding to a HC subject. The red parts correspond to the significant areas of the bundles.\nA comprehensive representation of the brain microstructure is not homogeneous, depending on the brain areas considered. It is reasonable to assume that the CC, which has a single, highly dense fiber bundle, can be adequately represented by a single anisotropic compartment. However, a more complex crossing fiber area would require the inclusion of several anisotropic compartments to ensure accurate representation. To address this, we employed a tool that automatically estimates the optimal number of anisotropic compartments using modularity clustering. In addition to optimally estimated numbers of anisotropic compartments, we also estimated free water in our sample. Several studies have shown that the use of a free water compartment gives a better biophysical model for detecting microstructure changes in various brain diseases such as Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia or traumatic brain injury 48,49 . Indeed, the FW measure quantifies the relative fraction of freely diffusing water in the extracellular space, which serves as a proxy for chronic low-grade central inflammation. The latter plays a central role in the neuropathogenesis of a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including LLD and apathy 50 . As demonstrated in our study, the PC1, which is predominantly composed of the free water compartment (i.e., inflammation), exhibited a general increase for the ATR left, CC _ 1, SLF _ I right, SLF _ III right, ST _ PREM left and UF left bundles in the LLD group when compared to HC. This finding aligns with previous hypotheses of increased low-grade inflammation in LLD 51 .\nRecently, some tractometry studies have explored the potential benefits of microstructural measures provided by MCMs along the fibers 18,21 . Mishra et al. proposed tract-specific FA (TSFA), corrected for the effects of crossing-fiber geometry using a MCM model. A weighted FA of the fitted two tensors was projected in the center line. Results of this approach suggest the potential of conducting tract analysis using MCM metrics. We suggested a similar approach while capitalizing on diffusion metrics and improving statistical power using multivariate statistics. Here, we used a PCA analysis that removes data redundancies while reducing dimensionality. Thus, for each fiber, at least 80 of the variability is explained by the first two PCs. In high-dimensional spaces, a common problem with PCA is that the interpretation of the resulting components can be challenging. Here, with only 5 dimensions, it is easier to identify an important contributor and thus bring more interpretability to the results. Indeed, the PC1 was composed of measures sensitive to axonal integrity (i.e., FA) and axonal neuroinflammation (i.e., FW), while the PC2 is a combination of FA and MD, both sensitive to tissue complexity, as reported in 52 . Note however, that all of these metrics are sensitive to the effects of neuroinflammation and other microstructural properties.\nAs reported in previous studies 53 using DTI model, we found alterations in UF, anterior parts of CC, ATR, SLF and striato-premotor fasciculus in LLD compared to HC group, confirming previous diffusion MRI studies in LLD 54 . The anterior CC plays a central role in depression pathogenesis 55 and is associated with many clinical features of LLD such as depression duration, cognitive symptoms or recurrence of depressive episodes 56 . Regarding the SLF, our results confirm findings reported in LLD 56 . Because the SLF is a key actor in complex motor planning, the modifications observed in the SLF may underlie the dysexecutive syndrome found in LLD 51 . The UF is also a crucial region implicated in depression, with lesions linked to diminished activity in regions involved in emotion regulation in LLD 57 . The difference in the neuroinflammation component value between LLD and HC in the ATR and projection fiber confirms previous results reporting an association between these tracts and serum inflammation in major depressive disorder 58 . Prefrontal corticostriatal loops are known to be involved in goal-oriented behavior, mediating motor behavior such as planning, learning and motor execution 59 . Interestingly, we found inflammation in the same regions associated with apathy severity namely the anterior CC, the SLF and the striato-premotor areas. This suggests that neuroinflammation in these tracts is associated with depression-induced apathy by disruption of processes related to cognitive control of behaviour and emotions. The association between apathy and inflammation in the CST suggests that impaired behaviour execution, independent of depression severity, might be involved in apathy in LLD. Lesions of the striato-premotor fasciculus have been reported in apathy in neurodegenerative disorders 35 , which may be more sensitively detected with multi-compartments modeling. Indeed, estimation of FW has provided sensitive FA measures at an early stage of Alzheimers and small-vessel diseases 60 , highly associated with inflammatory marker and cognitive score in regions such as the cingulum 10 . Thus, our findings suggest evidence of early inflammation in LLD-related apathy, in the same regions as in predementia-states, which might explain in part the known association between apathy and subsequent cognitive decline 7 .\nThis study uses tools that have limitations due to their complexity. As mentioned before, the choice of the multi-tensor model specification is a compromise between a more complex model and a more robust estimation. Several complex models could be tested such as DDI, CHARMED or NODDI. However, fitting the MCM parameter requires multi-shell dMRI data with at least one shell per anisotropic compartment 61 . With higher data quality, such as the DWI acquisition from the Human Connectome Project, we could probably relax some of the constraints on the model and perform MCM models with more compartments. In the future, we could explore automatic estimation of the number of compartments in MCM. One option would be to use histological data samples to train a deep learning network and later apply it to real data to obtain a more accurate estimate.\nAs a voxel could have a different number of anisotropic compartments between subjects, we averaged the microstructural metrics of anisotropic compartments. The microstructural metrics estimated by the proposed method are more accurate than the classical ones proposed by a DTI model. For example, in crossing fiber areas, the FA estimated by DTI is underestimated in comparison with our average value over the 2 or 3 anisotropic compartments. However, this method aggregates the measurement of several compartments whereas it might be interesting to consider them individually. Albeit challenging, in the near future, we aim at matching the fiber orientation of the anisotropic compartments.\nWhile TractSeg is a powerful tool to estimate accurately fiber bundles, choosing the best method to project the diffusion metrics along the centroid line is not trivial and might impact the overall results. Moreover, using a single center line could not be accurate, especially in the fiber bundles containing different streamline clusters, each with different orientations. As suggested in a recent study 19 , considering the entire fiber bundles segmentation as the shape, instead of their center lines could be more efficient. In the future, the robustness of the entire pipeline will also be tested on a larger cohort of individuals suffering from depression. Another limitation of the study is the absence of consideration of white matter hyperintensities which might have impacted the results as previously reported 62 . Future studies addressing this issue may be insightful to better model structural modifications of white matter in LLD. Having these limitations in mind while interpreting our results, our results suggest that improved estimation of diffusion metrics combined with multivariate statistics increase inflammatory-related LLD, especially towards reduced goal-oriented behaviors, opening the door to new cognitive decline biomarkers.",

This method enabled us to detect localized modifications of white matter microstructure associated with apathy in LLD and previously reported in dementia. We found microstructural change within the UF, anterior parts of CC, ATR, and SLF, demonstrating the utility of our method for the identification of early biomarkers of dementia. In addition, we also found significant modifications among the striato-premotor tract, which has not been described so far in the LLD literature and which is also known to be associated with major cognitive disorders. By doing so, we suggest new mechanistic perspectives to explain the increased risk of showing cognitive decline when suffering from LLD, especially with severe apathy.",

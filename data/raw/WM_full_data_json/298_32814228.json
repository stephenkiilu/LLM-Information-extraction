    "abstract": "White matter disruption in dementia has been linked to a variety of factors including vascular disease and cortical pathology. We aimed to examine the relationship between white matter changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in DLB and factors including vascular disease, structural atrophy and amyloid burden. Methods: Participants with DLB (n  29), Alzheimers disease (AD, n  17) and healthy controls (n  20) had clinical and neuropsychological assessments followed by structural and diffusion tensor 3T MRI and 18 F-Florbetapir PET-CT imaging. Voxelwise statistical analysis of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) was carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics with family-wise error correction (p  0.05). Results: DLB and AD groups demonstrated widespread increased MD and decreased FA when compared with controls. There were no differences between the DLB and AD groups. In DLB, increased MD and decreased FA correlated with decreased grey matter and hippocampal volumes as well as vascular disease. There was no correlation with cortical florbetapir SUVR. The relationship between DTI changes and grey matterhippocampal volumes remained after including Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric vascular score as a covariate. Conclusions: Widespread disruption of white matter tracts is present in DLB and is associated with vascular disease, reduced hippocampal volume and reduced grey matter volume, but not with cortical amyloid deposition. The mechanism behind the correlation observed between hippocampal volume and white matter tract disruption should be investigated in future cohorts using tau imaging, as hippocampal atrophy has been shown to correlate with tau deposition in DLB.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "White matter changes, visualised as white matter hyperintensities on structural T2 MRI, are associated with dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimers disease 1,2. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a means of measuring white matter integrity by examining the movement of water molecules. White matter disruption has been observed in DLB using DTI, particularly in parieto-occipital areas 345. White matter disruption in dementia has been linked to a variety of factors including vascular disease, cortical amyloid and tau deposition and cortical atrophy. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI are often attributed to microvascular disease 6. However, a large cohort study found that WMH correlated with cortical atrophy in addition to vascular risk factors 7. Medial temporal lobe atrophy has been shown to correlate with white matter hyperintensities in both DLB and AD 8. Low CSF amyloid (indicative of greater cerebral amyloid pathology) is associated with the accumulation of WMH on MRI in healthy older people 9. However, DTI alterations during life were found to correlate with neurofibrillary tangle stage but not neuritic amyloid plaque stage in AD 10. White matter hyperintensities on post-mortem MRI have been found to correlate with cortical amyloid and tau deposition, though on linear regression, only tau was independently related to WMH score 11. In AD, these lesions are not associated with the same degree of ischaemia as is observed in those of healthy controls 12. These findings suggest that white matter changes may be associated with neurodegeneration, in addition to vascular risk factors.\nIn dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimers disease pathology may be a factor in the development of white matter disruption in addition to vascular disease and Lewy body pathology. Amyloid and tau deposition are frequently observed in DLB, 13,14. Multi-modal imaging can help to establish which factors are most important in the development of white matter changes in different types of dementia. This study investigated these associations in DLB, comparing findings in diffusion weighted imaging to vascular risk factors, structural imaging and PET amyloid imaging.",

    "Aims and hypotheses": {
      "text": "We aimed to examine correlation between WM changes on DTI in DLB with factors that may be associated with white matter damage, including vascular factors, structural atrophy and amyloid burden. Hippocampal volume was investigated in addition to overall grey matter volume, as hippocampal atrophy has been shown to correlate with tau deposition in DLB 15. We included comparison groups of healthy similarly aged controls and an AD dementia group.\nWe hypothesised that DLB and AD subjects would have lower fractional anisotropy and greater mean diffusivity than healthy older people. In DLB, we hypothesised that these changes would be related to cortical pathology and cell damage, and that therefore, changes in white matter diffusion would be associated with lower grey matter volume, lower hippocampal volume and greater cortical amyloid deposition as well as increased vascular disease.",

All participants were 60 years old and had a diagnosis of probable AD or probable DLB confirmed by two clinicians based on contemporaneous diagnostic criteria 16,17, with an MMSE 12. Participants were recruited prior to the publication of the 2017 diagnostic criteria for DLB 18, but all DLB participants met the updated criteria for a diagnosis of probable DLB. Post-mortem diagnosis was used where available. Control participants were recruited through a research case register or were partners of participants.\nParticipants were excluded if they had a major concurrent psychiatric illness; severe physical illness; contraindications to PET-CT imaging or MRI; a history of other significant neurological illness including stroke or previous experimental treatment with an amyloid-targeting agent.\nParticipants with capacity gave their written informed consent to take part in the study. For those who lacked capacity, their participation in the study was discussed with a consultee in accordance with the UK Mental Capacity Act.

Details of the MRI and PET acquisition and analysis have been published elsewhere 23 and will briefly be summarised here.\nBrain MRI scans were acquired using a 3T MR scanner (Achieva scanner; Philips Medical Systems), with body coil transmission and eight channel head coil receiver. Images acquired included a 3D sagittal magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time 8.3 ms, echo time 4.6 ms, flip angle 8  , inversion delay 1250 ms, imaging time 4.5mins, sagittal acquisition matrix 216x240, voxel size 1x1x1mm) and echo planar imaging spin echo (EPI-SE) diffusion tensor imaging (TR 6126 ms, TE 70 ms, 124x120 matrix; 270x270 FOV; 59 slices with slice thickness 2.11 mm). Diffusion weighting was in 64 directions with a b value of 1000 smm 2 along with 6 images with b value of 0 smm 2 .\nAmyloid imaging was carried out using a Siemens Biograph-40 PET-CT scanner. Participants were given a 370MBq intravenous injection of 18 F-Florbetapir (Amyvid) followed by a 15 min scan starting 30-50 min after injection to image amyloid distribution. Images were reconstructed using iterative reconstruction (4 iterations, 16 subsets), with a 168x168 matrix size, 2.04  2.04 mm pixel size, 3 mm slice thickness, and 3 mm post-reconstruction Gaussian filter. Attenuation correction was performed utilising CT scan data.",

The DTI images were processed to correct for subject motion and eddy current distortion with eddy software. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA and MD data was carried out using TBSS 25. For each subject we calculated the mean FA and MD over all the pixels on the skeleton.\nThe 3D structural MR images were segmented into white matter, grey matter and CSF using SPM 8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspmsoftw arespm8); total intracranial volume defined as the sum of these. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation was carried out using the FLAIR and T1 structural images using a semi-automated thresholdbased algorithm employing SPM8 functions (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. ukspm) in an in-house written Matlab package (Matlab R2013a, Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) as described previously 26. The resulting WMH masks were manually edited using ITK-SNAP (www.it ksnap.org) to correct for minor errors. Hippocampal volumes were calculated using an automated technique 27. Grey matter volume (GMV), hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were expressed relative to total intracranial volume. There was a positive skew in the WMH data (Shapiro-Wilk statistic  0.85, p  0.001), therefore the log of WMH was used to make the data more normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk statistic  0.96, p  0.34).\nThe amyloid PET image was co-registered with the native space MRI. A mean cortical standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) was derived from the unweighted mean of frontal, temporal, parietal and cingulate regions relative to the whole cerebellum 28.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "We found significant decreased mean fractional anisotropy and\nincreased mean diffusivity in both DLB and AD when compared with controls. This is in keeping with damage to white matter tracts that is known to occur in both these diseases 29 and previous studies using DTI 3,4. We found more widespread areas of reduced FA and increased MD in DLB compared with controls than these previous studies, which found predominantly posterior changes. The most prominent changes were seen in the corona radiata, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, sagittal stratum and internal capsule. This is in keeping with some previous region of interest studies 30,31 though others have not found changes in these areas 32. Previous region of interest studies have also reported decreased FA in regions including the uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi in DLB compared with controls 5,32,33.\nThere were no differences between AD and DLB following FWE correction, again in keeping with some previous studies 3,4.\nThere was correlation between CIRS-G vascular score and FAMD in DLB. However, vascular disease does not appear to explain the differences between DLB and healthy controls in DTI measures. The control group had similar rates of smoking and similar scores on CIRS-G heart and vascular scales and higher resting systolic blood pressure than DLB cases. This is consistent with the hypothesis that white matter changes in dementia are not explained by vascular pathology alone and are associated with neurodegenerative disease processes 12.\nWe investigated this hypothesis using three markers of cortical pathologyamyloid deposition, grey matter volume and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was included as this has been shown to correlate with tau deposition in DLB 15. We found no correlation between amyloid deposition and FA or MD using TBSS. This is in keeping with post-mortem findings in AD, where tau has been identified as the pathological correlate of white matter disruption 10,11. The inclusion of amyloid deposition measured by PET in a previous study reduced the areas of significant reduction in fractional anisotropy in DLB and controls, though the difference was not felt to be substantial 4. An independent relationship between amyloid and FA was not reported. As such, at present there is no clear evidence for a link between amyloid deposition and DTI measures in DLB.\nWe found that decreased grey matter volume was associated with higher mean diffusivity in frontal areas. Relationships between white matter changes and grey matter volume loss in corresponding cortical areas have been reported in a previous DTI study 33. More strikingly, decreased hippocampal volume was associated with widespread increases in mean diffusivity and decreases in fractional anisotropy. Correlation remained present when vascular risk was accounted for using CIRS-G vascular score. These findings are in keeping with previous studies that found correlation between visually rated hippocampal atrophy and increased WMH 8 and decreased FA in the fornix, stria terminalis and corpus callosum 34. In the present study, using quantitative measurement of hippocampal size, more widespread correlation was identified. It may seem surprising that atrophy in a small brain region should be linked to global changes in cerebral white matter to a greater extent than global grey matter volume. An explanation for this may be that hippocampal atrophy is a marker for co-existing pathological processes such as tau deposition. Hippocampal atrophy is known to correlate with neurofibrillary tangle Braak stage correlates in DLB (Pearsons r  -0.63) 15. Neurofibrillary tangle Braak stage is known to be associated with DTI changes in AD 10. The link between hippocampal volume and white matter disruption in our cohort may therefore be explained by tau pathology as the causative factor for both findings. With the advent of tau imaging, it will be possible to test this hypothesis in future studies.\nWe found no correlation between DTI measures and baseline cognition or functional impairment, or progression in cognitive or functional impairment. An absence of correlation with global measures of cognition and function has previously been reported, though correlation has been found with measures of memory, verbal fluency, motor parkinsonism, and visual hallucinations in DLB 3,4. The lack of correlation with global measures of cognition and function may be due to a lack of power to detect such associations. This is a particular issue with longitudinal associations, due to attrition. Our data suggests that changes in FA and MD are associated with both the dementia process (as evidenced by differences between DLB and controls) and vascular changes (as demonstrated by correlation with CIRS-G vascular). Therefore, FA and MD may not track or predict the progression of the dementia process accurately. Despite this, the evidence presented here that white matter changes are related to measures of cortical pathology is worthy of further attention and further supports the hypothesis that not all white matter changes in dementia are related to vascular disease.",

    "Strengths and weaknesses": {
      "text": "This study reports a relatively large cohort of DLB participants with multimodal imaging and clinical assessment. TBSS results are presented with FWE correction to avoid false positive findings. A range of demographic factors were available to assess for confounding, such as smoking history, blood pressure measurement and vascular history. The degree of vascular disease in this cohort is limited by the exclusion of participants with clinical stroke. Therefore, vascular disease and vascular risk factors may play a greater role in white matter disruption in some cases of DLB, where severe vascular disease is present. The CIRS-G vascular sub-scale is an imprecise tool to measure vascular disease, but it did demonstrate correlation with FA and MD in DLB. We chose to use this scale to correct for vascular risk rather than WMH volume, as there is evidence that WMH reflects dementia pathology in addition to vascular pathology 7,9,12,35.\nThere are limitations to the use of TBSS in dementia subjects. Voxels compared between subjects may not be from the same anatomical position and changes in the size and shape of white matter tracts in different diseases can result in alignment errors 36. Therefore, the differences noted between healthy controls and the dementia groups may be influenced by morphological changes in the brain and scan misalignment rather than actual differences in FA and MD in specific white matter tracts. This manuscript predominantly focuses on comparisons within the DLB group. For these analyses, a specific FA skeleton for the DLB group was created. Group specific skeletons have been suggested by some authors to reduce the risk of misalignment 37. That said, the association of morphological changes (such as grey matter volume and hippocampal volume) with FA and MD in DLB could be influenced by misalignment in those with greater atrophy. However, this does not explain the greater associations observed with hippocampal volume compared with global grey matter volume, as the latter might be expected to have a greater influence on overall brain morphology.\nCorrelation between hippocampal volume and white matter disruption could be influenced by hippocampal white matter loss, as white matter changes causing loss of volume in the hippocampus could be associated with white matter disruption in other brain areas. However, we do not believe that this will have significantly impacted on our results, as the volume of white matter in the hippocampus is small and the automated segmentation of the hippocampus used seeks to exclude white matter 27.\nThe finding of widespread correlation between hippocampal volume and white matter disruption cannot be explained with certainty by the data available here. We have presented an evidenced-based hypothesis to explain the data i.e. that tau pathology may mediate the findings. This will need to be tested in future studies using tau imaging.",

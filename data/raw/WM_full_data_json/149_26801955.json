    "abstract": "White matter abnormalities have been shown in the large deep fibers of Alzheimers disease patients. However, the late myelinating superficial white matter comprised of intracortical myelin and short-range association fibers has not received much attention. To investigate this area, we extracted a surface corresponding to the superficial white matter beneath the cortex and then applied a cortical patternmatching approach which allowed us to register and subsequently sample diffusivity along thousands of points at the interface between the gray matter and white matter in 44 patients with Alzheimers disease (Age: 71.02 6 5.84, 16M28F) and 47 healthy controls (Age 69.23 6 4.45, 19M28F). In patients we found an overall increase in the axial and radial diffusivity across most of the superficial white matter (P  0.001) with increases in diffusivity of more than 20 in the bilateral parahippocampal regions and the temporal and frontal lobes. Furthermore, diffusivity correlated with the cognitive deficits measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P  0.001). The superficial white matter has a unique microstructure and is critical for the integration of multimodal information during brain maturation and aging. Here we show that there are major abnormalities in patients and the deterioration of these fibers relates to clinical symptoms in Alzheimers disease.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects much of the brain. There have been numerous investigations into the deleterious effects of the disease on subcortical and cortical gray matter and deep white matter large easily identifiable early myelinating fibers (for reviews see Amlien and Fjell, 2014;Jack and Holtzman, 2013;Weiner et al., 2012). Almost all of these suggest abnormalities to the cortical gray matter Ridgway et al., 2012 and the white matter in Alzheimers disease patients Sachdev et al., 2013, with both voxel Matsuda, 2013 and tract-based Liu et al., 2011 atlasing methods.\nThe novelty of this study was to focus on the health of the tissue lying at the interface between the cortical gray matter and white matter (here called the superficial white matter). The hypothesis behind this investigation was that the superficial white matter could be sensitive to disease processes because of its location and its unique characteristics. Indeed, the superficial white matter is comprised of intracortical myelin and short-range association fibers (Ufibers), which are the last regions to myelinate. This results in high plasticity but also high vulnerability Bartzokis, 2004. Second, the oligodendrocytes in the superficial white matter myelinate many axon segments with fewer wraps than in the deep white matter Butt and Berry, 2000, which gives them less protection against damage and makes the fibers more sensitive to impairments Haroutunian et al., 2014. Third, the superficial white matter has a much higher proportion of interstitial neurons than the deep white matter Suarez-Sola et al., 2009, and these neurons have been found to be relevant for the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease van de Nes et al., 2002.\nMost of the studies mentioned above, theoretically do not exclude the superficial white matter from their analysis procedures; however, they are limited with regard to the spatial alignment of the cortical boundary, which is highly variable across subjects Smith et al., 2006;Thompson et al., 2001. Therefore voxel-or tract-based atlasing methods might lack the sensitivity for quantifying corticocortical connectivity at the juncture between the gray matter and white matter. Similarly, because the white matter tracts in this region have less-defined trajectories, tract-based atlasing methods are limited for extracting these pathways with certainty Oishi et al., 2008. Likely, because of this the superficial white matter has not received much attention in Alzheimers disease. However, the superficial white matter is especially vulnerable to the normal aging process Phillips et al., 2013 and may thus also be vulnerable to disease processes in Alzheimers disease.\nTo address if degeneration of the superficial white matter is associated with Alzheimers disease we first wanted to assess if there was a difference in diffusion MRI metrics of whole brain superficial white matter between patients with Alzheimers disease and controls. Subsequently, we set out to determine the location of these abnormalities, their severity and their role in clinical manifestations. We predicted that diffusivity measures in the superficial white matter would be abnormal in Alzheimers disease patients and these abnormalities would be most severe in temporal and frontal lobes because they are late myelinating Phillips et al., 2013 and because the mesial temporal lobe is affected early in the disorder Braak et al., 1999, and less severe or even absent in the motor cortices because motor cortices are spared until the late stage of the AD Braak et al., 1999. Finally, we predicted that these abnormalities would be related to clinical measures of disease severity.\nTo achieve the goals above, we investigated a sample of 91 subjects (44 Alzheimers disease patients, 47 healthy controls) by applying an advanced computational analysis approach that combines information from both diffusion and structural MRI data to allow local sampling of superficial white matter integrity measures. This approach, which is highly sensitive for extracting and comparing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics within the superficial white matter at the juncture of the gray matter and white matter Phillips et al., 2011Phillips et al., , 2013, was applied to estimate and compare the effects of Alzheimers disease for axial, radial, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, at thousands of spatially matched locations within the superficial white matter.",

In brief, BrainSuite performs a sequence of image analysis steps including skull and scalp removal, nonuniformity correction, tissue classification, registrationbased identification of the cerebrum, topology correction, and surface generation to produce triangular surface mesh models of the inner and outer boundaries of the cerebral cortex. Next, the surfaces for each subject were registered to a reference atlas surface using BrainSuites surfacevolume registration software (SVR e.g.; http:brainsuite.org processingsvreg, V14B) Joshi et al., 2007. This is a refined cortical pattern matching-procedure that enables cortical surface mapping via alignments between surface features. SVR e.g. first finds a one-to-one map between these surfaces via an intermediate flat map Joshi et al., 2004. Geodesic curvature flow is used to improve registration of the sulcal features Joshi and Shattuck, 2012.

    "Mapping the Superficial White Matter": {
      "text": "Details for mapping the superficial white matter contained in Phillips et al., 2011Phillips et al., , 2013;; Figure 1, however, in short, after T1 and DTI processing, a mask was applied to the DTI images with the subcortical gray matter and ventricle labels from BrainSuite (http:brainsuite.orgprocessingsvreg). This was done to reduce the possible partial volume effects in these regions and further because our focus was not on changes within subcortical structures so removing them reduced the possibility of changes in these structures from influencing the results. No other masking was used. DTI images were then smoothed using a 2-mm kernel. Finally, to allow cross-subject sampling of anatomically comparable superficial white matter axialradialmean diffusivity and FA, diffusivity images were sampled along each vertex of the white matter surface (158,748 vertices) using Image To Shape Attributes from the LONI Shape Tools Joshi et al., 2010Joshi et al., , 2012  http:www. bmap.ucla.eduportfoliosoftwareShapeTools.\nSome important points about the process are worth mentioning, first the registration procedure between the DTI and T1 images has been significantly improved in recent years which allowed us to use a smaller smoothing kernel than in the past Phillips et al., 2011Phillips et al., , 2013. Furthermore, we had previously used a T1 tissue classified image to mask the corresponding DTI images so that only T1 classified white matter was left. However, here we used a subcortical gray matter and ventricle mask. We did not use a T1 classified white matter mask since improved registration between structural and diffusion images significantly reduced the need for smoothing and thus the possible influence of voxels that were completely gray matter. Third, the white matter surface created by Brainsuite is based on the T1 classified image. However, T1 weighted images are not optimized to quantify myelinated white matter volume Haroutunian et al., 2014. This is because tissue segmentation itself, relies on the thresholding signal intensity values for the purpose of classifying brain tissue types, and may also be impacted by microstructural changes in the interface between the gray matter and white matter that occur with age. The practical result of this is that if we had chosen to apply a T1 WM classified mask as opposed to the ventricle and subcortical gray matter mask that was used; we would reduce the sensitivity of the approach to intracortical myelin. Thus, given the data we had available, our approach optimized sensitivity to diffusivity changes at the juncture of the gray and white matter. However, scans with greater resolution that could give a better estimation of the boundary between the white and gray matter could further improve sensitivity. Furthermore, although the cross registration between the DTI and T1 images has been greatly improved, some misalignment will undoubtedly occur. Again, higher resolution scans could possibly reduce this limitation. Finally, Freesurfers Tracula (https:surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edufswikiTracula) motion correction (dmri_motion) Benner et al., 2011;Yendiki et al., 2014 was used to estimate differences in motion correction between patients and controls and an independent samples T test was used to test for differences between groups.",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "In this study, we examined the superficial white matter across the whole brain in an Alzheimers disease and a healthy control sample. Results revealed large increases in whole brain superficial white matter diffusivity in Alzheimers disease patients compared to controls. These significant findings suggest that abnormalities are pervasive across the whole brain. However to determine whether some regions are more vulnerable, we examined vertexwise changes over the superficial white matter, which allowed us to pinpoint the disease effects associated with increased diffusivity locally on the brain (see Figs. 4 and5). These disease effects were significant in most areas of the brain but were particularly prominent bilaterally in the parahippocampal gyrus and the temporal lobes while the motor regions were relatively spared. This pattern appears to be strongly related to the described progression of Alzheimers disease Braak et al., 1999.\nFinally, we showed significant associations between changes in the axial, radial, and mean superficial white matter diffusivity and the disease severity score (MMSE) in patients.\nThere are a growing number of studies of white matter in Alzheimers disease patients. These almost universally point to abnormal deep white matter in Alzheimers disease patients, with axonal damage proposed as the underlying mechanism together with decreased and progressive myelination Di Paola et al., 2010a,b; for review see: Amlien and Fjell, 2014.\nThe present findings expand the literature on brain changes in Alzheimers disease providing a more comprehensive picture of potential white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease. The main reason for this is because the deep white matter and the superficial white matter have different cellular and structural make-up as well as different roles in brain function. Thus, although our findings are in line with the large body of work on the deep white matter, the investigation of the widespread differences between patients and controls in the superficial white matter suggests different underlining mechanism and provides some clues on this relatively unstudied brain partition.\nThe cellular make-up of the superficial white matter differs from the deep white matter in several ways. For example, in early myelinating deep white matter, oligodendrocytes tend to myelinate a single axon segment with over 100 myelin membrane wraps, while late-myelinating regions (of which the superficial white matter is part of) contain oligodendrocytes which may myelinate as many as 50 axon segments with fewer than 10 wraps Butt and Berry, 2000. This makes the late myelinating oligodendroctyes structurally more complex and metabolically overextended Haroutunian et al., 2014;Peters and Sethares, 2004. While the present study is not directly studying these cells, they are found in high concentrations in the superficial white matter. As such, they could play an important role in the large differences in diffusivity found between patients and controls.\nAn examination of the vertex-wise changes in the superficial white matter (Fig. 5) suggest that the late myelinating regions such as the language areas as well as the dorsolateral and medial orbital-frontal areas are in fact particularly sensitive compared to early myelinating regions such as the bilateral motor regions. Interestingly, a recent study using cortical myelin maps Grydeland et al., 2013 (T1w T2w ratio images sampled along a cortical surface) found a pattern of age effects which is very similar to the disease effects we found. This same pattern was also seen in a separate study using axial and radial diffusivity Phillips et al., 2013 to investigate age effects in the superficial white matter. These two studies appear to reinforce the hypothesis that late myelinating regions are vulnerable as the brain ages and the current study suggests that this vulnerability is likely even greater in patients with Alzheimers disease. Indeed, we found that the late myelinating superficial white matter, such as that in the temporal lobe, had increases in diffusivity ranging between 10 and 25.\nIts important to note though, that most of the brain had relatively large increases in diffusivity (between 10 and 15), which suggests that all of the superficial white matter is vulnerable to Alzheimers disease processes with the exception of the motor cortices. The largest increases in diffusivity were seen in the parahippocampal regions, with large bilateral increases of 25 in patients compared to controls. It would be easy to disregard the magnitude of this finding as the result of partial volume effects due to the expanded ventricles from reduced hippocampal volume in patients; however, we removed both the ventricles and the hippocampus, thus reducing the likelihood of this. Furthermore, our finding is in line with histological studies which found that the parahippocampal gyrus is one of the first areas to show neuropathological changes Braak et al., 1999;Braak and Braak, 1990. Also, volumetric reduction of the parahippocampal gyrus has been reported in MRI studies of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease patients Ech avarri et al., 2011 as well as reduced myelination Fornari et al., 2012. While we dont know the precise biological processes underlying variations in DTI parameters (for review see: Jones et al., 2012) and caution should be used in interpreting the results, these large increases in diffusivity strongly suggest changes in superficial white matter tissue structure. Fur-thermore, there is a general agreement that increased mean diffusivity value reflecting greater diffusion of water molecules are associated with tissue atrophy. Increased axial diffusivity is related to white matter axonal changes likely associated with Wallerian degeneration but may also be associated with an increased fiber organization during the human brain tissue life span Hasan et al., 2007. Increased radial diffusivity is thought to reflect reductions in myelination Schmierer et al., 2008. Decreased fractional anisotropy indicates the loss of water directionality likely due to damage of the structural organization of the tissue. Its worth highlighting that axial, radial, and mean diffusivity were much more sensitive to disease processes than fractional anisotropy. This is likely because in the superficial white matter the difference between axial and radial diffusivity values is smaller than in the deep white matter, this suppresses the usefulness of fractional anisotropy as a measure in this region. Thus, our findings in Alzheimers disease patients tentatively suggest that the superficial white matter incurs axonal atrophy (increased axial diffusivity) and myelin damage (increased radial diffusivity). In support of this conclusion, one recent study using a ROI approach examined the superficial white matter in a small cohort of Alzheimers disease patients with magnetization transfer ratio and found bilateral demyelination in a pattern similar to the one presented here in Figure 4 Fornari et al., 2012.\nThe correlation between superficial white matter and global disease severity (MMSE), suggests that the structural abnormalities can be seen as a manifestation of the pathologies evolution. Indeed, superficial white matter has a role in phase synchronization and neuronal synchrony, which is critical for optimized brain function Grydeland et al., 2013. Thus disruptions to the superficial white matter may lead to disruptions in the propagation of signals across the brain. As indicated by low MMSE scores, Alzheimers disease patients brains are not functioning optimally. Our finding of a strong negative correlation between MMSE score and diffusivity lends support to this conclusion.\nThese data are in agreement with a number of EEG studies which have found signal changes in Alzheimers disease patients Czigler et al., 2008;Gallego-Jutgl a et al., 2014;Jeong, 2004, as well as a recent DTI study looking at abnormalities in short-range fibers in Alzheimers disease Gao et al., 2014 that found that the abnormalities contribute to lower cognitive efficiency and higher compensatory brain activation.\nAnother aspect to point out in the attempt to understand the role of superficial white matter in Alzheimers disease is that the superficial white matter contains a large numbers of interstitial neurons. These morphologically heterogeneous cells are numerous in the white matter underlying the cortical gyri and decrease in density towards the deep white matter. Their function is not well known, which may be because they are uniquely r Superficial White Matter in Alzheimers Disease r r 1331 r represented in humans and only rudimentarily represented in non-primate mammals (for review see: Suarez-Sola et al., 2009). Friedlander and Torres-Reveron 2009 found that these cells receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, potentially monitoring outputs from axon collaterals of cortical efferents, from cortical afferents and or from each other. These cells therefore participate in modulating functions of local synaptic networks. They have recently been suggested to have played a critical role in the evolution of cognition, self-awareness, and human language Juda s et al., 2013. Its important to note, we cannot yet discern whether or not the interstitial neurons are in anyway damaged in the Alzheimers disease pathology. However, we have shown that there are significant abnormalities in the tissue where they reside in high numbers. If the interstitial neurons function is as important as the emerging research suggests it is, further investigations into the interstitial neurons is warranted.",

    "LIMITATIONS": {
      "text": "Some potential study limitations are worth noting. As discussed in the methods section, partial volume effects are a potential problem as they are with any method that uses segmentation and steps were taken to minimize this confound. Further, the superficial white matter surface is generated from the T1 weighted image which is not optimised to classify white and gray matter. Future studies could benefit from advanced imaging methods which could possibly help delineate the boundary at the juncture between the gray matter and white matter. A secondary option would be to generate a superficial white matter surface from the diffusion data directly, which would eliminate the need to register the diffusion data to the T1 image. However, this approach would present its own challenges. Regarding the results, although the disease effects are likely driven by changes in the superficial white matter, there are, as we mention earlier, well-documented changes in the deep white matter Di Paola et al., 2010b and thus these changes may influence the results. Future studies with high field MRI could help elucidate the relationship between the deep and superficial white matter. Also, we are unable to resolve the important question of whether deficits in structural connectivity contribute to the onset of Alzheimers disease or whether it is a secondary effect brought on by changes in gray matter. Future longitudinal studies could help clarify this as well as illuminate the role of interstitial neurons. Finally, although DTI protocols with more diffusion directions might be optimal in some contexts, the 30-direction protocol employed in this study included three averages, which serves to increase signal to noise. Thus, this protocol is superior to a 30direction protocol including only one average, and no bias is expected with regard to the statistical findings because DTI parameter estimates are the same for both groups. Nonetheless, future studies including higher angular reso-lution DTI data might help confirm the regional specificity of superficial white matter disconnectivity in Alzheimers disease and clarify relationships with specific functional impairments.",

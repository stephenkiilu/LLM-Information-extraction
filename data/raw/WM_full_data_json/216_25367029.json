    "abstract": "Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is considered primarily a disease of grey matter, although the extent of white matter involvement has not been well described. We used diffusion tensor imaging to study the white matter in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease compared to healthy control subjects and to correlated magnetic resonance imaging findings with histopathology. Twenty-six patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and nine age-and gender-matched healthy control subjects underwent volumetric T 1 -weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. Six patients had post-mortem brain analysis available for assessment of neuropathological findings associated with prion disease. Parcellation of the subcortical white matter was performed on 3D T 1 -weighted volumes using Freesurfer. Diffusion tensor imaging maps were calculated and transformed to the 3D-T 1 space; the average value for each diffusion metric was calculated in the total white matter and in regional volumes of interest. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was also performed to investigate the deeper white matter tracts. There was a significant reduction of mean (P  0.002), axial (P  0.0003) and radial (P  0.0134) diffusivities in the total white matter in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Mean diffusivity was significantly lower in most white matter volumes of interest (P 5 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), with a generally symmetric pattern of involvement in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Mean diffusivity reduction reflected concomitant decrease of both axial and radial diffusivity, without appreciable changes in white matter anisotropy. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed significant reductions of mean diffusivity within the white matter of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, mainly in the left hemisphere, with a strong trend (P  0.06) towards reduced mean diffusivity in most of the white matter bilaterally. In contrast, by visual assessment there was no white matter abnormality either on T 2 -weighted or diffusion-weighted images. Widespread reduction in white matter mean diffusivity, however, was apparent visibly on the quantitative attenuation coefficient maps compared to healthy control subjects. Neuropathological analysis showed diffuse astrocytic gliosis and activated microglia in the white matter, rare prion deposition",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Human prion diseases are a group of rare and invariably fatal diseases due to misfolding of the normal protein, the prion protein (PrP C ), into an abnormal conformation (the prion or PrP Sc ) that causes progressive neurodegeneration in the brain. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common form of human prion disease and classically is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus, leading to akinetic mutism and death usually within a year or less from onset (Brown et al., 1986).\nMRI has become increasingly important for the clinical diagnosis of sporadic CJD. In addition to its important role in excluding other causes for rapidly progressive dementias, MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis of human prion disease (Geschwind et al., 2009), even early in the illness (Shiga et al., 2004). FLAIR and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences allow the detection of hyperintensities both within subcortical grey matter (striatum and thalamus) and cortical grey matter (so called cortical ribboning) (Young et al., 2005;Satoh et al., 2007;Tschampa et al., 2007;Meissner et al., 2009;Galanaud et al., 2010). DWI hyperintensities in sporadic CJD are more evident and typically positive earlier in the disease than on FLAIR images (Demaerel et al., 1999;Shiga et al., 2004;Vitali et al., 2011). The DWI hyperintensities are due to reduced diffusivity of water molecules in the grey matter, which should be confirmed on mean diffusivity maps (showing hypointensity). Specific neuropathological changes (including vacuolization, prion deposition and possibly astrocytic gliosis) seem to be associated with these grey matter DWI changes (Geschwind et al., 2009). Although sporadic CJD is generally considered to affect primarily grey matter and MRI abnormalities generally have not been observed in white matter, there is histopathological evidence that white matter damage is widespread, with abnormal deposition of neurofilament proteins and neuritic distensions suggesting neuroaxonal pathology (Liberski and Budka, 1999;Armstrong et al., 2002).\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive MRI technique that allows quantitative assessment of microstructural changes in otherwise normal appearing brain tissue. Recently this technique was applied to study 21 patients with E200K genetic prion disease (Lee et al., 2012) and showed reduced fractional anisotropy in many important white matter pathways and suggested that reduced fractional anisotropy was associated with a functional disconnection syndrome (Lee et al., 2012). Whether white matter is primarily affected in CJD or involved secondarily through involvement of cell bodies within the grey matter remains unclear (Kucharczyk and Bergeron, 2004). There are cases of CJD with extensive white matter involvement on T 2 -weighted images, which have been referred to as panencephalopathic sporadic CJD. Most reported cases have been in Asia, particularly Japan, and are isolated to patients with long survival due to extensive life-prolonging measures (Mizutani et al., 1981;Kruger et al., 1990;Yamada et al., 1997;Ghorayeb et al., 1998;Matsusue et al., 2004;Hama et al., 2009). White matter abnormalities in these patients might simply be the result of secondary Wallerian degeneration and not related to primary involvement of the white matter (Jansen et al., 2009;Deguchi et al., 2012). A recent paper focusing on DTI measures (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity) in the caudate, corpus callosum, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pulvinar, precuneus, and frontal lobe, found no significant white matter abnormalities in a small sporadic CJD group compared to healthy subjects or a cohort of subjects with rapidly progressive dementia (Wang et al., 2013). To our knowledge, however, no studies to date have addressed how DTI parameters change across the entire brain within the white matter of patients with sporadic CJD. The aims of this study were: (i) to determine quantitatively whether white matter diffusion changes occur in sporadic CJD; (ii) to describe the pattern of white matter involvement using quantitative diffusion and visual assessment; and (iii) to correlate white matter histopathology with the MRI changes.",

Masks of whole brain grey and white matter were extracted and the Desikan-Killiany Atlas in Freesurfer was used to obtain 34 grey matter volumes of interest per hemisphere in the native coordinate system of each subject (Dale et al., 1999;Fischl et al., 1999). Subcortical white matter boundaries were defined from the grey matter parcellations by defining outer boundaries 4 mm subjacent to each cortical region. Thus each subcortical white matter volume of interest included the area of white matter 4 mm below the grey-white border for each Freesurfer parcel. Accuracy of the segmentation results was validated by a neuroradiologist (E.C.) and was reprocessed until correct or if it failed to adequately segment it was excluded.\nDTI processing. After correcting for distortions due to eddy current and head motion, maps of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were calculated by fitting the diffusion tensor model within each voxel using the FDT software tool in FSL. To improve the visualization of white matter difference in mean diffusivity maps we also created attenuation coefficient maps attenuation coefficient  exp ( Àb Â mean diffusivity) . In these images, typical diffusion contrast is inverted and differences enhanced. B  0 images were then registered to the brain-extracted volumes from T 1 -weighted images using an affine alignment (FLIRT). The transformation matrix obtained was then applied to the DTI parameter maps. The mean values for mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity were calculated in the total white matter and within each volume of interest on co-registered images.\nStatistical analysis. For cross-sectional comparisons, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test was applied to age-corrected Z-scores to evaluate differences of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity values in the total white matter and in each",

There was, however, a more widespread trend (0.05 5 P 5 0.1, FWE) towards reduced mean diffusivity in the homologous regions of the right hemisphere and bilaterally in the anterior thalamic radiations, the left inferior superior longitudinal fascicles and the left fornix (not shown).\nFractional anisotropy was significantly reduced in subjects with sporadic CJD compared to controls bilaterally in only a few regions: the anterior limbs of the internal capsule, the anterior portion of the externalextreme capsule, the fornix, the genu of the corpus callosum, the rostral portion of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus (P 5 0.05, FWE) (Fig. 2). In contrast, axial diffusivity was widely reduced in almost all TBSS skeleton regions (P 5 0.05, FWE) (Fig. 2). Although there were no statistically significant changes in radial diffusivity, there was a trend towards reduction (0.05 5 P 5 0.1, FWE) in most TBSS skeleton regions (Fig. 2). To better understand the contribution of DTI metrics to the diffusion changes, we performed a region of interest-based analysis, selecting clusters of voxels with either significant mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy reduction in sporadic CJD compared to controls (Lee et al., 2012); this analysis showed that: (i) in regions with reduced mean diffusivity, the decreased mean diffusivity seemed to be due to a similar contribution from both reduced axial and radial diffusivity (Supplementary Fig. 1A), leading to a fractional anisotropy within normal range; and (ii) in regions with reduced fractional anisotropy, the decreased fractional anisotropy seemed to be due to significantly reduced axial diffusivity, whereas the radial diffusivity was normal (Supplementary Fig. 1B). These findings are concordant with the Freesurfer analysis.",

In five of six patients white matter samples were taken from the middle-superior frontal, inferior parietal and internal capsule regions. For Subject 12 parietal tissue was not available, so a superior temporal tissue block was used. The subcortical samples were 1 cm 3 blocks and included subcortical white matter with overlying grey matter and portion of deeper white matter. The internal capsule samples included a portion of the thalamus.\nFormalin-fixed samples were processed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 8 mm thickness. The sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (Fisher Scientific cat SH26-500D and cat 245-658) or processed for immunohistochemistry with the PrP-specific 3F4 monoclonal antibody (Prusiner Laboratory, UCSF) and for astrocytes with an anti-GFAP antibody (Dako cat Z0334). Secondary antibodies used for 3F4 and GFAP were a biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (Vector laboratories cat BA-2000) and a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector laboratories cat BA-1000), respectively.\nThe peroxidase substrate DAB kit (Vector laboratories cat SK-4100) was used for colour development. Bielschowsky silver stain was used to evaluate white matter axonal degeneration.\nA neuropathologist (S.J.D.) with extensive experience in CJD pathology assessed the severity and extent of histopathological changes in each white matter region comparing with the overlying grey matter. The degree of astrocytic gliosis and prion deposition was graded according to a 4-point scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) and by the percentage of each area involved. For vacuolization, only the percentage of area involved was assessed. The Spearman nonparametric test was used to assess the correlation between histopathology rating results and the quantitative metrics results, as well as with visual assessment rating scores in the frontal and parietal lobes. For correlation of quantified MRI data with neuropathology, we used the last UCSF MRI; two of the six subjects (Subjects 2 and 5) with neuropathology had serial MRIs, and we used their secondlast UCSF MRI. The MRI data used for the analysis comparing MRI (visual assessment and mean diffusivity) to pathological findings were acquired over a mean 81 AE SD 79 days before death (range 9-205; median 67.5 days). After the initial histopathological analysis, to identify any activated microglia associated with reactive astrocytosis or areas of demyelination, we reanalysed and processed the tissue with immunohistochemistry with anti-IBA1 antibody (Wako 019-19741) (Kanazawa et al., 2002) and with Luxol Fast blue or Cresyl violet, respectively.",

There was a trend towards reduced fractional anisotropy in the total white matter healthy controls  0.356 ( AE 0.023), sporadic CJD  0.337 (AE 0.033), P  0.06.\nRegional analyses of subcortical white matter showed mean diffusivity was significantly reduced in the majority of subcortical white matter volumes of interest (Table 2 and Fig. 1); no increase in mean diffusivity was observed in any volumes of interest. The group-wise pattern of involvement was relatively symmetric, except some temporal lobe regions in which the left hemisphere was more involved than the right hemisphere (Table 2 andSupplementary Table 1).\nMost volumes of interest had no changes in fractional anisotropy, although a few showed a significant (or trend towards) reduction in fractional anisotropy (Fig. 1, Table 2 andSupplementary Table 1). Similar to mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity was significantly reduced in the subjects with sporadic CJD compared to controls in all but two volumes of interest, in which there was a trend towards reduction (Table 2 andSupplementary Table 1) and occipital white matter volumes of interest, but less widely in the frontal, limbic white matter volumes of interest, although there was a trend towards reduction in these regions (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, mean diffusivity reduction seems due to a concomitant reduction of both axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, without appreciable changes in white matter anisotropy (fractional anisotropy overall was relatively normal).\nThere was a statistically significant positive correlation (Spearmans  0.64, P 5 0.001) between the subcortical white matter mean diffusivity and the overlying cortical grey matter mean diffusivity values, which we had calculated previously in the same subjects (Caverzasi et al., 2014).

White matter of the remaining five sporadic CJD cases had little or no PrP Sc staining in either the subcortical or deep white matter (Fig. 3D), particularly when compared to the overlying cortical grey matter (Fig. 3C).

Significant areas (blue code) of decreased DTI metrics in sporadic CJD versus controls are shown in the skeleton (green) (P 5 0.05). There was a statistically significant reduction of mean diffusivity (MD) in the left hemisphere in the limbs of the internal capsule, the thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. There was a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) bilaterally in the frontal lobe. There was a statistically significant reduction of axial diffusivity (AD) in the majority of white matter, whereas no areas of reduced radial diffusivity (RD). None of the DTI metrics showed increased values in sporadic CJD compared to controls (P 5 0.05). By slightly lowering the threshold for significance to P 4 0.06, many more regions in multiple areas of the TBBS skeleton showed decreased average mean diffusivity (Supplementary material). TBSS white matter skeleton of the occipital lobes is not shown, due to the lack of any statistically significant DTI metric changes in this region.\nWhite matter involvement in sporadic CJD Brain 2014: 137; 3339-3354  3345 was moderately intense and diffuse reactive astrocytic gliosis (Fig. 3L andTable 3); the same degree of reactive astrocytic gliosis, however, was found in the white matter of all other sporadic CJD cases and thus did not necessarily co-localize with PrP Sc (Fig. 3F). Reactive astrocytic gliosis of the cerebral cortex was significantly more intense in the white matter than in the grey matter (Fig. 3E andF), with an increased number of reactive astrocytes, which had more staining of processes (filled with GFAP immunopositive fibrils) and enlarged cell bodies (Fig. 4A andD) in all cases. In the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, there was a moderate, patchy reactive astrocytosis (although mild relative to the reactive astrocytosis in the white matter) and generally confined to layers 1 (Fig. 3E andK) and 6 (not shown). Areas of cortical grey matter with reactive astrocytosis seemed to accompany PrP Sc deposition (Fig. 3C, E, I andK). Most of the intense reactive astrocytes appeared to surround arterioles. In areas without PrP Sc , there was no reactive astrocytic gliosis (not shown). Finally, standard vacuolation, as typically seen in grey matter in sporadic CJD, was seen in only 5 of white matter in all subjects, regardless of the presence of PrP Sc (Fig. 3B andH). Occasional micro vacuoles were found focally in the white matter of the sporadic CJD cases with PrP Sc (not shown); these were considered artefacts, however, as they were not like the typical vacuolation of grey matter seen in prion disease and because they can be found in non-CJD cases. Typical vacuoles in the grey matter (Figs. 3A andG) were found in synaptic regions in all cases. In all patients there were patchy foci of white matter demyelination in all regions evaluated. No evident axonal degeneration in the white matter was present in any of the cases.\nIn all cases activated microglia were found throughout the grey matter (Fig. 4B) and white matter (Fig. 4E). In both the grey matter and white matter, activated microglia often seemed intimately associated with reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4C andF); in the white matter, however, activated microglia were primarily found associated with reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4F), whereas in the grey matter, activated microglia were in all regions regardless of the amount of reactive astrocytosis (cf. Fig. 4A andB with Fig. 4D andE).

      "text": "In this study we surprisingly detected widespread white matter involvement in sporadic CJD on diffusion imaging, characterized predominantly by reduced mean diffusivity, with no areas showing increased mean diffusivity. These changes were both in the total white matter as well as regionally within both subcortical and deep white matter. The white matter alteration was clearly visible on the attenuation coefficient map (Fig. 5) and seemed to be associated (although not statistically significant) histopathologically with reactive astrocytic gliosis and activated microglia (Table 3). To our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the whole brain white matter, and to show global reduced white matter mean diffusivity, in sporadic CJD.\nReduced mean diffusivity in the grey matter (cortical, striatal andor thalamic) on diffusion-weighted imaging is well-described as highly diagnostic for sporadic CJD (Shiga et al., 2004;Vitali et al., 2011), and most literature suggests a correlation of reduced mean diffusivity with vacuolization and prion deposition, and less so with astrocytic gliosis (Haik et al., 2002;Geschwind et al., 2009;Manners et al., 2009). We now report similarly reduced diffusion in the white matter in sporadic CJD; histopathological findings confirm white matter involvement in sporadic CJD, characterized by pathological alterations partially overlapping with those in sporadic CJD grey matter, but with more diffuse and reactive astrocytic gliosis (and activated microglia) and with rare PrP Sc deposition and vacuolation, present as only microvacuolation (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Pathological vacuolation in the white matter of sporadic CJD can be difficult to differentiate from artefactual In both the grey and white matter, activated microglia appeared intimately associated with reactive astrocytes (C and F), which however, were not always obviously in contact with activated microglia. This is probably related to the tissue section thickness (8 mm). A, B, D and E were taken with a Â20 objective lens; C and F were taken with a Â 40 objective lens. Scale bars: E  100 mm, and also applies to A, B and D; F  100 mm, and also applies to C. vacuolation due to the fixation and staining processes (Garman, 2011). Activated microglia were found throughout the grey matter and white matter and seemed to be intimately associated with reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4C andF). Surprisingly, in all six cases with pathological analysis of the white matter, there were patchy foci of demyelination with no concomitant axonal degeneration.\nAlthough conventional MRI usually do not show any significant white matter involvement in sporadic CJD, animal models of prion disease have described white matter pathology characterized by similar histopathological features to those found in grey matter, with PrP Sc deposition, reactive astrocytes and vacuolation (Taraboulos et al., 1992;Brandner et al., 1996;Prusiner, 1998;Bouzamondo-Bernstein et al., 2004;Safar et al., 2005). Animal models have also suggested a role of normal prion protein (PrP C ) in myelin protectionmaintenance (Radovanovic et al., 2005;Bremer et al., 2010;Popko, 2010) and a possible role of white matter in the spread of prions in the brain (Kimberlin, 1983;Fraser and Dickinson, 1985;Kordek et al., 1999). Despite this, there are few studies showing evidence of white matter involvement in sporadic CJD (Bugiani et al., 1989;Muhleisen et al., 1995;Armstrong et al., 2002). One study of 15 subjects with CJD examining astrocytosis and vacuolation in the white matter, found diffuse astrocytosis, similar to the grey matter; the vacuolation ranged from subtle microvacuolation to areas with demyelination and severe vacuolation (Bugiani et al., 1989). Another study of six patients with sporadic CJD reported astrocytosis and microglial activation diffusely throughout the white matter, similar to our findings (Muhleisen et al., 1995). Also consistent with our findings, PrP Sc staining did not co-localize with microglia (Muhleisen et al., 1995). Another study examining subcortical white matter pathology in 11 subjects with sporadic CJD found intermittent large clusters of vacuoles accompanied by diffuse astrocytic gliosis. Some of the clusters were distributed with regular periodicity across the base of subcortical white matter, similarly to what they found in the adjacent or overlying grey matter, suggesting to the authors the possibility of cortical-subcortical spread (Armstrong et al., 2002).\nWe found PrP Sc deposition was overall rare in the white matter, although one case, however, had mild to moderate involvement. This case is consistent with some literature reporting the occasional presence of PrP Sc in the white matter in sporadic CJD (Muhleisen et al., 1995) as well as with mouse models in which PrP Sc is not only routinely detected in the white matter (DeArmond et al., 2002;Spilman et al., 2008), and suggest that it might be transported along white matter axons to distant grey matter regions (Bouzamondo-Bernstein et al., 2004).\nIn our cases, there were several clear differences between the reactive astrocytosis in the white and grey matter. In the grey matter, the reactive astrocytosis was much less robust and patchier, corroborating previous literature in sporadic CJD and animal models (Syrian hamsters and transgenic mice) in which reactive astrocytosis tended to co-localize with PrP Sc . In the white matter, we found reactive astrocytosis was moderate to severe The attenuation coefficient maps are based on the following formula: exp( À b Â mean diffusivity); greenblack colours indicate high mean diffusivity and orangewhite indicate low mean diffusivity. Note the extensive reduced mean diffusivity in sporadic CJD white matter. To compare the attenuation coefficient maps of each patient to the histopathology rating scores we reported the total gliosis rating based on Table 3. Gliosis total scores were obtained combining frontal, parietal and internal capsule rating scores. Prion deposition and vacuolation are not reported in this figure. Interestingly, there seems to be an association between more reduced mean diffusivity on the attenuation coefficient maps and worse histopathological rating score (Table 3). For example, sCJD subjects 12 and 18, who presented with the worst gliosis scores, had lower mean diffusivity values compared to the other subjects.\nWhite matter involvement in sporadic CJD Brain 2014: 137; 3339-3354  3349 and diffuse, but not associated with PrP Sc deposition. What causes these astrocytes to become reactive in CJD is not well understood (Navarro et al., 2004). Interestingly in animal models, PrP Sc seems to induce microglial activation, and this event precedes reactive astrocytosis and neuronal degeneration (Williams et al., 1997;Marella and Chabry, 2004;Liu et al., 2011). In the brain, two major classes of astrocytes, biochemically and developmentally distinct, have been identified on the basis of morphology and distribution in the brain: fibrous astrocytes with many glial filaments composed of GFAP and located mainly in white matter; and protoplasmic astrocytes with few glial filaments and located mainly in grey matter (Miller and Raff, 1984). The different degree of reactive astrocytic gliosis occurring in the white matter compared to grey matter might indicate that protoplasmic astrocytes (in the grey matter) are capable of forming a dense reactive astrocytic gliosis as fibrous astrocytes (in the white matter). Although the grey matter was filled with deposits of PrP Sc , the white matter in five of six cases showed little or no PrP Sc by immunohistochemistry. The presence of PrP Sc in the grey matter might explain the presence of activated microglia there, however the relative absence or paucity of PrP Sc in the white matter in most of our cases with sporadic CJD raises the question of what causes the microglia to become activated and exuberant reactive astrocytosis to occur in white matter. Furthermore, animal models suggest that PrP Sc is transported between brain regions by axonal transport (Bouzamondo-Bernstein et al., 2004) and that PrP Sc is transported out of neurons by exocytosis to the extracellular space. Perhaps sufficient PrP Sc is exocytosed from axons in the white matter to activate microglia and secondarily cause reactive astrocytosis (DeArmond et al., 1996;Liberski and Budka, 1999;Marella and Chabry, 2004;Bajsarowicz et al., 2012;Kouadir et al., 2012), but the PrP Sc is removed in the process, which is why we do not see it in most cases. The same exocytosis mechanism could result in astrocyte infection with prions and formation of PrP Sc (Raeber et al., 1997). Finally, it is possible that there was sufficient secondary axonal degeneration (although we did not see this by Bielchowsky staining) in the white matter due to neuron loss in the grey matter to account for reactive astrocytic gliosis and activated microglia.\nIt is peculiar that although our white matter data show a different ratio of histopathological substrates compared to that typically seen in the grey matter, both grey matter and white matter showed reduced mean diffusivity on DTI (Caverzasi et al., 2014) and at the cortical level grey matter and white matter mean diffusivity values correlated quantitatively. Theoretically, vacuolation (Mutsukura et al., 2009), prion deposition, astrocytic gliosis (Geschwind et al., 2009) andor microgliomatosis could cause reduced mean diffusivity in white matter of sporadic CJD cases (Broom et al., 2007). Although we did not find a statistical correlation between any of these histopathological features and mean diffusivity, this was not unexpected for two reasons. First, the limited amount of data (only six patients and only two regions for each patient) is a limitation of this study and likely negatively affected our ability to discover any statistically significant correlation. Second, we tested a correlation between an averaged mean diffusivity value within an entire Freesurfer volume of interest with histopathological results obtained from a smaller autopsy tissue sample of the same region-the region sampled pathologically might not have been very representative of the larger Freesurfer region averaged for mean diffusivity. Given these limitations, if we have to explain reduced mean diffusivity in white matter based on our histopathological results, it would seem most likely due to astrogliosis and microgliomatosis.\nAlternatively, the diffusion changes seen on MRI might not be directly related to histopathology, but could be due to prion disease causing impairment of functional processes in brain cells, such as altered ion channel function due to decreased plasma membrane fluidity (DeArmond et al., 1996) or impaired axonal transport (Liberski and Budka, 1999). Supporting this possibility is that reduced mean diffusivity also occurs during strokes and although the underlying cause of these diffusion changes is still controversial, a membrane dysfunction has been hypothesized (Wardlaw, 2010).\nAs we found reduced mean diffusivity in white matter of sporadic CJD, our results differ from what it is usually reported in non-prion neurodegenerative diseases, in which white matter damage (whether primary or secondary) usually results in normal to increased mean diffusivity with variability in fractional anisotropy (Pierpaoli et al., 2001;Song et al., 2002;Agosta et al., 2010Agosta et al., , 2011;;Canu et al., 2011). Surprisingly, our results using DTI and TBSS differ from a study on the TBSS findings in a cohort of patients with genetic CJD with the E200K mutation (Lee et al., 2012), which usually have several clinical and MRI features overlapping with sporadic CJD (Goldfarb et al., 1991;Parchi et al., 1999;Fulbright et al., 2006;Schelzke et al., 2012). In this interesting study on white matter magnetic resonance diffusion in 21 E200K subjects, they found average reduced fractional anisotropy in several white matter tracts (corticospinal tract, internal and external capsule, fornix, and posterior thalamic radiation) mainly due to increased radial diffusivity (with normal axial diffusivity), with a slightly increased mean diffusivity (Lee et al., 2012). In our sporadic CJD cohort we had very different findings. Only a few regions, mostly in frontal and cingulate cortices, showed a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy and, contrary to Lee et al. (2012), it was always associated with decreased mean diffusivity. Furthermore, in our study the reduction of fractional anisotropy in these regions was driven by a more substantial reduction of axial diffusivity than radial diffusivity (Supplementary Fig. 1). There are several possible explanations for the different findings. E200K genetic prion disease patients overall have more deep nuclei and less cortical involvement on DWI, than most sporadic CJD cases. The increased radial diffusivity with normal axial diffusivity might be suggestive of demyelination in E200K. Although we are not aware of any CNS demyelination in E200K, demyelination in the PNS has been reported in E200K (Antoine et al., 1996).\nOur finding of a greater effect on axial diffusivity (reduction) than radial diffusivity might be due to common neuroaxonal pathological abnormalities in sporadic CJD, such as dystrophic neurites and neurofilament accumulation, which suggests axonal transport abnormalities (Liberski and Budka, 1999) that might lead to primarily reducing axial diffusivity. Another possibility might be that concomitant demyelination, which we found as patchy foci across the white matter regions analysed, leading to a local increase in radial diffusivity (Song et al., 2002), counterbalances some of the reduction of radial diffusivity related to the underlying cause of the mean diffusivity reduction (e.g. either due to histopathological or functional changes). In the literature, demyelination has been mostly described in CJD mouse models within the peripheral neuronal system (Neufeld et al., 1992;Antoine et al., 1996). To our knowledge, only one previous study, reported in a book chapter, has shown demyelination in the CNS in humans (Bugiani et al., 1989). Although it is not known why CNS demyelination occurs in sporadic CJD, it might be due to leukolysins released by actrocytes and macroglia (Liberski et al., 1989) or to the conversion of the normal prion protein, which appears to be involved in myelin (Radovanovic et al., 2005;Bremer et al., 2010;Popko, 2010).",

    "Visual assessment": {
      "text": "Visual assessment on T 2 -weighted images in most subjects did not show any significant white matter changes, except for punctuate deep white matter and thin periventricular white matter abnormalities. A moderate degree of deep white matter T 2 changes, associated with smooth or confluent periventricular and deep white matter foci, were found only in two of 26 subjects. White matter abnormalities on T 2 -weighted images were characterized by increased mean diffusivity on attenuation coefficient and mean diffusivity maps (Supplementary Fig. 2) and thus are not the cause of decreased mean diffusivity. Mean diffusivity white matter changes were only appreciable quantitatively, whereas by visual assessment of standard diffusion imaging (DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient map) these abnormalities are usually not detected. We found, however, that attenuation coefficient maps (an inverse of the mean diffusivity maps routinely used), with opposite contrast (Fig. 5) seem to facilitate detection of white matter abnormalities by visual assessment in sporadic CJD. The mild degree of white matter changes detected on visual assessment of T 2 sequences compared to the clear abnormalities on attenuation coefficient, suggests that white matter abnormalities occur on a microstructural level assessed by DTI.\nWe suggest that the infrequent T 2 abnormalities found on visual assessment in sporadic CJD are likely signs of chronic small vessel disease or, alternatively, initial signs of white matter secondary degeneration. A classic example of white matter secondary degeneration in sporadic CJD is likely represented in the rare panencephalitic form of CJD, reported mostly in Asian countries in which some patients have very long disease durations because the cultures support profound life-extending measures, such as feeding tubes and intubation. In cases with the panencephalitic form of CJD, there is usually significant global atrophy with status spongiosis in grey matter and extensive abnormalities in white matter, correlating with disease duration and severity of cortical atrophy (Mizutani et al., 1981;Carota et al., 1996;Matsusue et al., 2004;Tschampa et al., 2007;Jansen et al., 2009). The panencephalitic form of CJD is probably not so much a specific subtype of CJD, but rather a more non-specific very late, endstage of exceptionally prolonged cases of CJD, characterized by white matter secondary degeneration to the diffuse late stage neuronal loss (Shyu et al., 1996;Parchi et al., 1999;Iwasaki et al., 2006;Jansen et al., 2009).",

    "Primary versus secondary white matter pathology": {
      "text": "In the study of magnetic resonance diffusion in E200K subjects discussed above, the authors speculate about a primary mechanism of white matter damage (a myelinopathy due to the replacement of PrP C by PrP Sc ) leading to a functional disconnection syndrome (Lee et al., 2012), however, histopathological data supporting this hypothesis were not shown.\nOur results definitely show white matter abnormalities in sporadic CJD; nevertheless it is challenging to determine whether these white matter changes are primary or secondary. There is some evidence supporting primary involvement of white matter in prion disease. In animal models, PrP Sc appears to induce microglial activation and this event precedes reactive astrocytosis and neuronal degeneration (Marella and Chabry, 2004). Therefore, the widespread restricted diffusion in sporadic CJD white matter in association with reactive astrocytic gliosis and microglial activation (although with rare prion deposition) might represent primary pathogenic events. Due to their cytotoxic potential, astrocytic gliosis and reactive microglial activation might play a major role in sporadic CJD pathogenesis (Liberski et al., 1989;Muhleisen et al., 1995;Marella and Chabry, 2004). In the absence of detectable PrP Sc deposition in the majority of our cases we can only speculate that either a subtle leakage of PrP Sc from axons (Bajsarowicz et al., 2012), or other factors, such as release of interleukins (Marella and Chabry, 2004;Liu et al., 2011;Kouadir et al., 2012), might induce microglia in the white matter. Nevertheless the observation of similar diffusion changes (reduced mean diffusivity) in both white matter and grey matter might indicate that the same primary pathological mechanism is occurring; if so, then reduced mean diffusivity might not be due to specific histopathological changes (e.g. vacuolation, PrP Sc deposition or gliosis), which differed between white matter and grey matter, but rather to some physiological change or dysfunction. At least three findings suggest that the white matter changes (reduced mean diffusivity) identified in our sporadic CJD group are not due to secondary white matter degeneration (caused by neuronal loss). First, as discussed above, our DTI metrics findings were not consistent with axonal degeneration (Pierpaoli et al., 2001;Song et al., 2002;Agosta et al., 2010Agosta et al., , 2011;;Canu et al., 2011); second, there was not significant grey matter atrophy in our cohort (Caverzasi et al., 2014); and third, there was no evidence for axonal white matter degeneration on histopathology.\nIn conclusion, this work shows for the first time a widespread reduced mean diffusivity within the white matter of subjects with sporadic CJD. This imaging finding may provide an additional imaging feature that could be used in the differential diagnosis of CJD, although this needs to be assessed. Our histopathological analyses showed concomitant astrocytic gliosis and microglial activation, with patchy foci of demyelination; although these changes were not statistically correlated with reduced mean diffusivity, this might have been due to insufficient power. We did not find axonal degeneration, which is generally associated with increased mean diffusivity. These imaging and histopathological findings may reflect direct white matter damages occurring White matter involvement in sporadic CJD Brain 2014: 137; 3339-3354  3351 during early to middle stages of sporadic CJD, rather than changes secondary to neuronal degenerationloss.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive diagnostic tests for Alzheimers disease (AD) are limited. Postmortem diagnosis is based on density and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-rich neuritic plaques. In preclinical stages of AD, the cells of origin for the perforant pathway within the entorhinal cortex are among the first to display NFTs, indicating its compromise in early stages of AD. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the integrity of the parahippocampal white matter in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, as a first step in developing a noninvasive tool for early diagnosis. Subjects with AD (N 5 9), MCI (N 5 8), or no cognitive impairment (NCI; N 5 20) underwent DTI-MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD) and radial (RD) diffusivity measured from the parahippocampal white matter in AD and NCI subjects differed greatly. Discrim-inant analysis in the MCI cases assigned statistical membership of 38 of MCI subjects to the AD group. Preliminary data 1 year later showed that all MCI cases assigned to the AD group either met the diagnostic criteria for probable AD or showed significant cognitive decline. Voxelwise analysis in the parahippocampal white matter revealed a progressive change in the DTI patterns in MCI and AD subjects: whereas converted MCI cases showed structural changes restricted to the anterior portions of this region, in AD the pathology was generalized along the entire anterior-posterior axis. The use of DTI for in vivo assessment of the parahippocampal white matter may be useful for identifying individuals with MCI at highest risk for conversion to AD and for assessing disease progression.",

      "text": "INDEXING TERMS: DTI; microstructure; MCI; AD conversion; limbic; perforant pathway The development of noninvasive biomarkers for Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology is essential to improve premorbid diagnostic accuracy and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies as they are developed. The postmortem diagnosis of AD is based on the presence, density, and distribution of two hallmark features; neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-rich neuritic plaques (Gomez-Isla et al., 2008;Trojanowski, 2002;Wippold et al., 2008). Ideally, biomarkers should therefore target these histopathological hallmarks. Currently, positron emission tomography (PET) studies can identify amyloid plaques (Clark et al., 2012;Driscoll et al., 2012;Furumoto et al., 2013;Okamura and Yanai, 2010;Ono, 2009), but NFTs have been less well stud-ied (Braskie et al., 2010;Jensen et al., 2011;Shin et al., 2011;Small et al., 2002).\nSeveral reports agree that accumulation of NFTs signals neuronal death and that their distribution and density correlate highly with disease severity (Gomez-Isla et al., 1996). In AD, the cortical region that displays the highest number of NFTs is the entorhinal cortex (EC) within the ventromedial temporal lobe (Van Hoesen et al., 1991), where NFTs make up a high percentage of the large multipolar neurons that form layer II of the EC in AD (Van Hoesen and Solodkin, 1993). The critical nature of these changes is best appreciated by considering the connectional relation between the hippocampus and the rest of the cerebral cortex. The EC gives rise to the perforant pathway, a major neural system of the temporal lobe, which terminates on the hippocampus. This pathway represents the greatest source of cortical input to the hippocampus and represents a key link to the remainder of the cortex (Duvernoy, 1988;Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977). Importantly, in the preclinical stages of AD, the cells of origin for the perforant pathway, in layers II and III of the EC, in addition to the neurons of the perirhinal cortex, are the first to display NFTs (Braak and Braak, 1997b). Hence, it is expected that their presence should affect the axons of the perforant pathway and then the cell bodies of layers II and III (Van Hoesen et al., 2000).\nBased on the hierarchical and temporal distribution of NFTs that develops over the course of AD, several imaging techniques have been applied to assist in making an early diagnosis. The most important of these are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, including 1) T1-weighted MRI to assess the degree of atrophy in specific limbic regions or to identify specific AD-like atrophy patterns SPARE-AD (Davatzikos et al., 2009(Davatzikos et al., , 2010;;Misra et al., 2009) and 2) MR spectroscopy to measure neuronal metabolites (for reviews see Chetelat et al., 2005;De Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000;Hampel et al., 2008;Jack et al., 2010;Small, 2002;Sprooten et al., 2009). However, because these approaches are likely to require a significant degree of neuronal death before showing alterations, a more sensitive method that detects subtle changes in tissue integrity prior to neuronal death is necessary. A third MRI method, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), permits the assessment of microstructural characteristics of specific brain pathways (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996;Filler and Bell, 1992;Le Bihan et al., 2001;Pierpaoli et al., 1996). This method has already shown significant utility in the assessment of cerebral ischemia, acute stroke, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury (de Crespigny et al., 1995). Several studies have already used DTI to assess the integrity of hippocampal white matter pathways in AD, whether alone (Fellgiebel et al., 2004;Muller et al., 2005) or in combination with hippocampal atrophy (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2010;Bosch et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2009;Cherubini et al., 2010;Damoiseaux et al., 2009;Fellgiebel et al., 2006;Liu et al., 2009;Muller et al., 2005;Sexton et al., 2010;Stenset et al., 2009;Teipel et al., 2010). However, it has not yet been possible to make individual predictions on which subjects with MCI have the highest likelihood of converting to AD.\nAs a first step toward the development of a sensitive, noninvasive technique for the preclinical diagnosis of AD, we tested whether DTI MRI could be used to detect a disruption of white matter integrity in an area that includes the perforant pathway. Furthermore, we evaluated this technique for its potential to predict which subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) would convert to AD early. MCI is a diagnosis that carries a high risk for conversion to AD within the subsequent 3-5 years (Modrego, 2006;Petersen, 2004;Petersen and Negash, 2008), but only a fraction of those diagnosed, ranging from 10 to 50 (Geslani et al., 2005;Petersen, 2004), will convert at all. It is currently impossible to predict, based on noninvasive testing alone, who will convert and who will not. In fact, it has been reported retrospectively that MCI subjects who eventually convert to AD tend to have lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) values in several brain regions at initial assessment (Fellgiebel et al., 2006;Kalus et al., 2006;Rose et al., 2006). Others have found that patients with MCI show a correlation between cognitive impairment and a decrease in FA or MD in the perforant pathway region (Kalus et al., 2006;Rogalski et al., 2009). However, such group analyses do not provide predictive probabilities for individuals with MCI, i.e., the ability to determine at the time of initial evaluation the risk that a single individual will convert to AD. In the current study, we investigated the use of DTI measures as potential predictors of risk of progression from MCI to AD for individual patients. By expanding beyond group differences, we aimed to develop a real-world application of the technique. The goal of this study was to determine whether DTI measurements within the ventromedial temporal lobe differ between control and AD subjects and, if so, whether altered measures in MCI can potentially predict the risk for future conversion to AD.",

    "MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects": {
      "text": "Research volunteers were prospectively and consecutively recruited from the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders at The University of Chicago. Control subjects were recruited from within the local community or were caregivers of patients. Individuals with pre-existing severe psychiatric or neurological illness (e.g., cerebrovascular disease or evidence of stroke on brain imaging) or dementia other than AD were excluded. The diagnosis of probable AD followed the recommendations of the joint working group of the NINCDS and the AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA;McKhann et al., 2011). Specific diagnoses for each individual were developed at a consensus conference comprising neurologists, neuropsychologists, social workers, and geriatricians. If the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score was 26 or higher, all subtest scores of the neuropsychological battery were less than 1.0 standard deviation below normal, and there were no impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs), the subject was labeled as no cognitive impairment (NCI). The diagnostic criteria for MCI were modeled after those used in the Memory Impairment Study (Albert et al., 2011) and included 1) memory complaint by patient or informant; 2) abnormal memory function, documented by scores greater than 1 SD from the mean on delayed recall in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; 3) no impairments in ADLs or iADLs; 4) normal general cognitive function; and 5) not sufficiently impaired, cognitively or functionally, to meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD. All MCI cases enrolled were labeled amnestic MCI, because memory impairment was the predominant cognitive feature, and none had significant cerebrovascular disease on imaging to suggest a vascular component, the major diagnostic category predicted by multidomain MCI.\nOne year later, MCI subjects were reassessed by the same clinicians, who were blind to the initial predictions obtained from the imaging data. This study and all procedures for recruitment and consent were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Division of Biological Sciences of The University of Chicago. All participants or their proxy gave written consent for their participation in the study.",

These regions were manually outlined using known landmarks (Van Hoesen, 1995), as recently confirmed with a DTI sequence in humans (Augustinack et al., 2010;Zeineh et al., 2012): 1) parahippocampal white matter region defined anteriorly by a vertical plane at the level of the middle portion of the amygdala and the rhinal sulcus, if present (corresponding to the anterior limit of the EC); posteriorly by the vertical plane at the level of the lateral geniculate; and laterally by the collateral sulcus. Figure 1 shows a coronal section at the level of the anterior entorhinal cortex, depicting the mask used to determine the region of the parahippocampal white matter. 2) The cerebral peduncle (CP) was used as a reference measure, because primary sensory and motor cortices are among the last cortical regions to develop NFTs in AD (Arnold et al., 1991;Suva et al., 1999). It was defined at the level of the midbrain, with the posterior limit demarcated by the substantia nigra. ROIs (performed by a neuroanatomist, A.So.) were traced twice. The reproducibility of the regions (rater blinded to the first measurement) was demonstrated by the 97 spatial overlap between the two tracings. The photomicrograph (Fig. 1B) was obtained by high-resolution scanning of the original film (HP Scanjet 5500c) and stored using Photoshop, in which the contrast was increased (13).

For this, the first step was to establish group differences between the AD and the NCI groups. To assess simultaneously the differences between groups across the two hemispheres, we first performed a Shapiro-Wilks test to determine multivariate normality for each measure (FA, MD, k1, and RD) for the parahippocampal white matter and CP vectors. Boxs M-test was used to assess whether the AD and NCI groups had similar covariance matrices, and, if so, a parametric multivariate Hotelling T 2 test was used to assess the two hemispheres simultaneously. Otherwise, the nonparametric Cramer test was used.",

First, the Wilks lambda test was used to guarantee that the discriminant function successfully separated the two groups. Second, we used the leave-one-out (or crossvalidation) method to estimate correct classification rates. In this process, each individual case with a known membership was taken out from the group, and its membership was reassigned based on the remaining cases. Correct classification rate was expressed as the E,G) images. The white matter ROI containing the parahippocampal white region is highlighted in A in green so that the reader can compare its location to the landmarks used. The MPRAGE was chosen for presentation clarity purposes only since the actual ROIs were drawn in the PD images obtained with similar resolution to the DTI. The Nissl-stained section shows the main landmarks and neighboring regions limiting the entorhinal and hippocampal regions. Note that, in the graphic representation of the hippocampal region by Dejerine and Dejerine-Klumpke (1901), the fibers of the perforant pathway are shown penetrating the subiculum. The lower row shows samples of the actual ROIs as seen in an anterior and a posterior slice of the entorhinal area. ec, Entorhinal cortex; hf, hippocampal fissure; cs, collateral sulcus; dg, dentate gyrus; s, subicular complex; am, amygdalar body; un, uncus of the hippocampus; ot, optic tract.

Consequently, we expected that our MCI group would display a large variance in the DTI data. To avoid this confound inherent in a group statistical analysis, we compared individual MCI subjects with the AD and NCI groups. We first assumed an equal probability of each DTI metric from each MCI subject to belong to either the AD or the NCI group. We then assigned each measure to the corresponding group through the quantification of the smallest Mahalanobis distance. This computation refers to the distance in mean FA, MD, k1, and RD values between each subject and the centroid of the AD and NCI groups. This analysis provided a way to predict the MCI individuals most likely to progress to AD. Finally, to assess possible confounds with partial tissue volumes, we calculated Pearsons correlation within groups, between FA values and the volume of the parahippocampal white matter region.",

DTI metrics were extracted on a voxel-by-voxel basis from the parahippocampal ROIs, and their frequency distributions were calculated. Differences of skewness between AD and NCI were determined for each DTI metric using the Cramer test, and comparisons on the distributions were performed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nClustering analysis centered on the FAMD distributions was used to determine contrasts between groups, and clusters were modeled based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution (mclust software; Fraley and Raftery, 2007). Clusters represented by ellipsoids of variable size, shape, and orientation were selected based on a Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Using the mean values from the cluster with the highest FA and lowest MD values (derived from the NCI group) as a reference origin, we calculated the Mahalanobis distances to this origin for all voxels from each group. Differences between groups were obtained using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and corrected for multiple comparisons with the Westfall-Young procedure. Finally, the mean values of these distances were mapped back to the anatomical space in the anterior-posterior axis of the parahippocampal ROI.

Figure 6 also illustrates the existence of an additional population of voxels in the NCI, MCI, and AD groups (marked green) that have different locations with respect to the reference cluster. That is, some are closer to the reference and some are farther. These voxels had different locations in each group. Hence, whereas in controls they are close to the reference, in the MCI group they are clearly segregated, with many values shifted to a lower FA range, highlighting the larger variance of this group.

By contrast, later changes seen as larger distances in AD compared with MCI (AD) affect the posterior portion of the parahippocampal white matter (P 5 10 25 after correction for multiple comparisons; Fig. 7).

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "Changes in the architecture of the parahippocampal white matter as an in vivo biomarker to predict the conversion from MCI to AD MCI is now an accepted diagnostic category that portends an elevated risk for the development of AD or other dementia (Almkvist et al., 2002;Geslani et al., 2005;Morris, 2005;Petersen, 2004). To improve its predictive potential, several noninvasive imaging-based diagnostic studies that assess structural, metabolic, and functional outcomes associated with conversion of MCI cases to AD have been investigated (for reviews see Baclet-Roussel et al., 2010;Defranceso et al., 2010;McEvoy et al., 2011). However, the specificity of these methods remains inferior to that of invasive neuropathological markers (for reviews see Diniz et al., 2008;Mitchell, 2009;van Rossum et al., 2010). Application of PET-based amyloid imaging may have great diagnostic potential in this regard, but its predictive capacity is limited by the poor correlation of amyloid with disease onset and progression (Chubb et al., 2006;Duyckaerts et al., 2009;Giannakopoulos et al., 2003;Van Hoesen and Solodkin, 1994) and the high cost of these studies compared with MRI.\nDTI MRI has emerged as a sensitive method for resolving changes in the structure of neuronal fiber bundles within the brain, and it has been applied to the study of several neurological diseases (Kunimatsu et al., 2003;Mori et al., 2002), including AD (for review see Ewers et al., 2011;Gold et al., 2012;Matthews et al., 2013). We reasoned that its specific application to the early diagnosis, or even prediction of development, of AD would depend on assessing a brain region that displays the earliest pathology. Several studies have shown that the distribution of pathology in AD is not random (Arnold et al., 1991;Nagy et al., 1999;Sassin et al., 2000), and this has been supported by numerous MRI-based studies (Fox and Schott, 2004;Jack et al., 2004;Kantarci et al., 2005). It is precisely this differential distribution of neuronal death in AD (Mitchell et al., 2002) that has led many to apply noninvasive techniques to diagnose early or prodromal states of AD (Drago et al., 2011;Killiany et al., 2000;Mortimer and Petersen, 2008;Valls-Pedret et al., 2010).\nAlthough the current sample size that we report is rather small, the clear segregation among our experimental groups suggests that DTI metrics of the parahippocampal white matter region can be a sensitive method to discriminate subjects with AD from cognitively intact subjects. Furthermore, the metric abnormalities were limited to the parahippocampal region and were not present in the corticospinal pathway (Rose et al., 2000), suggesting a selective pathway alteration, at least in earlier disease stages.\nIt has been reported that NFT pathology within the entorhinal cortex may be present prior to behavioral manifestations of AD (Braak and Braak, 1997a;Mitchell et al., 2002). In this context, our results for MCI subjects were quite interesting. When subjected to discriminant analysis, the four DTI metrics of the parahippocampal white matter region of three of eight (38) MCI subjects indicated that they belonged to the AD group and five (72) to the NCI group. At a 1-year followup visit, those MCI subjects classified as AD-like by DTI were reclassified as early AD by clinicians blinded to the imaging data. This correlates well with the prediction that 10-40 of patients diagnosed with MCI convert to AD within 1-2 years (Buchanan, 2009;Falini et al., 2005;Mosconi, 2005;Pavlovic and Pavlovic, 2009;Pennanen et al., 2005). Future studies with larger samples, however, are needed to confirm these preliminary results.",

    "Complex architecture of the parahippocampal ROI": {
      "text": "We performed a voxelwise analysis to understand better the potential biological interpretations of the changes observed. For this, we have to consider first the nature of the ROI (parahippocampal white matter).\nAlthough our ROI included the perforant pathway, as with most pathways within the CNS, it is not distinctly segregated. Indeed, although the perforant pathway is the largest cortical association pathway in the temporal lobe (Van Hoesen, 1982, 1995) and its axons form a compact bundle (angular bundle) on their way to the hippocampus, partial volume effects in MR imaging resulting from crossing fibers are common. Because the entorhinal region is a true anatomical hub in the sense of the distributed nature of its connectivity (Insausti et al., 1987a,b;Van Hoesen, 1995), few DTI studies with sophisticated techniques have succeeded in tracking the human perforant path either in vivo or ex vivo (Augustinack et al., 2010;Yassa et al., 2010;Zeineh et al., 2012).\nThe complex composition of the parahippocampal white matter considered in this study includes connectivity with a large variety of cortical and subcortical regions (e.g., amygdala and limbic thalamus; Amaral and Cowan, 1980;Amaral and Price, 1984) in addition to the reciprocal connections with the hippocampus proper and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977;Van Hoesen and Pandya, 1975;Witter, 2007). Indeed, major reciprocal connections of the entorhinal perirhinal areas originate in cortical association and limbic cortices, including the anterior insula; superior temporal sulcus; inferior, medial temporal and occipitotemporal regions; anterior and posterior cingulate, peristriate, and orbitofrontal cortices (for review see Insausti, 1993;Lavenex et al., 2002;Van Hoesen, 1995). This multipathway structure necessarily implies that changes captured by DTI metrics will depend on a complex reorganization of the architecture resulting from partial damage to some but not all axons found within the ROI at different times.",

    "AD decreases the complexity of the parahippocampal white matter architecture": {
      "text": "The first change we detected in the group and the voxelwise analyses was a decrease of FA in both MCI (AD) and AD individuals as has been reported amply for AD (Ewers et al., 2011;Fellgiebel and Yakushev, 2011;Gold et al., 2012;Matthews et al., 2013;Oishi et al., 2011;Sexton et al., 2010;Stebbins and Murphy, 2009;Stepan-Buksakowska et al., 2012). Because FA is a normalized metric, it does not provide information on the cause of the decrease. It could be due to a decrease in axial diffusivity representing a decrease of the larger diffusion value, an increase in the two secondary Eigen values (radial diffusion), or a combination of both. The relevance of exploring with more precision the origins of the changes observed is that each one of these possibilities can be associated with more specific modifications in the architecture of the tissue. To disambiguate this observation, this initial result has to be considered in the context of the other metrics. Our results show that axial, mean, and radial diffusivities tended toward larger values in AD. In addition, multivariate distributions based on FAMD showed a clear difference, with lower FA and higher MD values in AD.\nThe question to be addressed is the nature of the structural changes related to the increase in mean diffusivity along an increase in axial diffusivity in AD. More specifically, the DTI acquisition used a rather low value of b (b 5 900), at a level that has been suggested to represent extracellular diffusion (Assaf and Cohen, 2000). Hence, the more specific question relates to the nature of the structural changes that are diminishing restrictions to the extracellular diffusion of water along with a simultaneous increase in axial diffusivity. Given this, we posit that the increase in MD can be due to an increase in the size of the extracellular space resulting from degeneration of axonal processes, demyelination, or thinning, in some but not all axons included in the white matter ROI. This increase in the extracellular space can produce a decrease in the degree of crossing fibers within the region, producing an apparent increase in axial diffusivity from the axons less affected by the illness. In other words, our results may reflect a decrease in the complexity of the anatomical architecture of this region reflecting selective and sequential deterioration or structure of limbic and nonlimbic connectivity associated with the parahippocampal region.",

    "Disease progression from MCI to AD is detected by voxel structural disruption": {
      "text": "Distances measured from the reference cluster reflect a hierarchical progression shift to lower FA and higher MD-RD values from NCI to MCI (AD) to AD. That is, disease progression involves not only voxels with larger structural changes but also a larger number of them. In other words, even though all subjects (including healthy controls) have voxels with high FA and low MD-RD (voxels within the reference cluster) and voxels with low FA and high MD-RD (damaged voxels), a critical issue may be the relative proportion of these two types of voxels. Is there an inflexion point at which the damaged voxels are at a level in which function is finally compromised? Distribution of structurally disrupted voxels progresses in an anterior-posterior fashion along the clinical progression of disease Structurally disrupted voxels were not distributed homogeneously in the parahippocampal white matter of MCI (AD) and AD. Whereas the anterior portion of the parahippocampal white matter had the largest burden of these voxels in MCI patients who converted to AD, in AD these were distributed along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the ROI. The differential distribution of pathological voxels in the anterior parahippocampal region may explain the variance of the probability values associated with MCI membership (to AD or NCI) via discriminant analysis (range 52-100). In other words, it is possible that focusing the analysis on the anterior regions could increase the sensitivity of the approach.\nOn the other hand, these regional differences might not be surprising, based on the topology of corticocortical connectivity to and from the entorhinal region in macaques. To illustrate this point, Mohedano-Moriano and colleagues (2007) showed that some of the input connectivity has biases to restricted entorhinal regions. For instance, anterior regions preferentially receive inputs from lateral orbitofrontal regions, anterior cingulate, agranular insula, and visual association cortices. Connectivity to intermediate regions comes from the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and auditory association cortices. Finally, posterior regions receive inputs from the parietal and retrosplenial regions. In parallel, the perforant pathway projects to the hippocampus with an anterior-posterior topology. These three anterior-posterior bands are reminiscent not only of the cytoarchitectural subfields of Amaral, Insausti, and colleagues (Amaral et al., 1987;Insausrti et al., 1995) but also of the organization of the entorhinal intrinsic connectivity (Chrobak and Amaral, 2007). Our results placing the initial changes in the anterior portion of the parahippocampal white matter are consistent with recent DTI reports highlighting early Alzheimers pathology in limbic regions (Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010), including its preponderance in anterior hippocampus (Fellgiebel and Yakushev, 2011). Additionally, the fact that pathology extends caudally at later stages of disease suggests that DTI metrics within the parahippocampal white matter can be applied not only as a biomarker for the detection of prodromal AD but also to aid in following the progression of disease into later stages.\nFurthermore, we submit that our biomarker for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD might have higher sensitivity by focusing the assessment on the anterior half of the parahippocampal white matter. We have preliminary data suggesting that the distribution of damaged voxels might also have a bias to the medial portion of this region. Confirmation of this preliminary observation, however, awaits further analysis.",

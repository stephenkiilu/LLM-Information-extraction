    "abstract": "The rs1344706 single nucleotide polymorphism within intron 2 of the ZNF804A gene is strongly associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This variant has also been associated in some studies with a range of cognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes, but several studies have reported no effect on the same phenotypes in other samples. Here, we genotyped 670 healthy adult Norwegian subjects and 1753 healthy adult Swedish subjects for rs1344706, and tested for associations with cognitive phenotypes including general intellectual abilities, memory functions and cognitive inhibition. We also tested whether rs1344706 is associated with white matter microstructural properties using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 250 to 340 of the Norwegian and Swedish subjects, respectively. Whole-brain voxel-wise statistical modeling of the effect of the ZNF804A variant on two DTI indices, fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), was performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and commonly reported effect sizes were calculated within several large-scale white matter pathways based on neuroanatomical atlases. No significant associations were found between rs1344706 and the cognitive traits or white matter microstructure. We conclude that the rs1344706 SNP has no significant effect on these phenotypes in our two reasonably powered samples.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 is located in intron 2 of the gene ZNF804A, which encodes a protein with a zinc-finger domain. Zinc finger proteins bind to nucleic acids andor proteins and are functionally diverse (Laity et al., 2001). ZNF804A may have a role in regulation of early neurodevelopment (Chung et al., 2010), cell adhesion (Hill et al., 2012) and oligodendrocyte differentiation and proliferation (Riley et al., 2010).\nThe rs1344706 SNP was first associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) in a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) by ODonovan et al. (2008) (P-value¼1.61 Â 10 À 7 , odds ratio OR¼1.12). Inclusion of Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.comlocatepsychresns bipolar disorder (BPD) strengthened the association, which surpassed the genome-wide threshold (P-value¼9.96 Â 10 À 9 , OR¼ 1.12) (ODonovan et al., 2008). Subsequent studies supported a robust association between SCZ and rs1344706 (Riley et al., 2010;Sazci et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2012) or other variants within ZNF804A (Li et al., 2011). Association of ZNF804A variants has also been reported with BPD (Williams et al., 2010;Lett et al., 2011;Steinberg et al., 2011) and autism spectrum disorders (Griswold et al., 2012;Talkowski et al., 2012). Some studies, however, failed to replicate the association between rs1344706 and SCZ or BPD (Dwyer et al., 2010;Li et al., 2011;Schanze et al., 2011;Zaharie et al., 2012). In the recent multicentre datasets from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC, as seen on the ricopili web site http:www.broadinstitute.orgmpg ricopili), the association with SCZ was weaker than previously reported (P-value¼0.00018, OR¼ 1.08). However, other SNPs in the region, independent of rs1344706, showed association with SCZ (rs7579085: P-value¼0.0014) and with BPD (e.g., rs1583048: P-value¼0.00012), which suggests allelic heterogeneity.\nThe use of intermediate phenotypes, including cognitive and brain-imaging traits, has been suggested as an approach to parsing the effects of genetic factors in psychiatric disorders (Gottesman and Gould, 2003;Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger, 2006). Patients with psychiatric disorders often present cognitive dysfunctions in several domains, e.g., speed of processing, verbal fluency, memory and attention (Lesh et al., 2011). These impairments are central to the intellectual and social dysfunction of the patients (Keefe and Harvey, 2012). Brain imaging has suggested abnormalities in brain morphometry and volumetry (Rimol et al., 2010(Rimol et al., , 2012;;Haijma et al., 2012) and structural and functional brain connectivity in patients with SCZ (Fitzsimmons et al., 2013;Mamah et al., 2013;Skudlarski et al., 2013;Waltz et al., 2013). Several studies have investigated the effects of rs1344706 on cognitive and brain-imaging traits.\nAt the cognitive level, Walters et al. (2010) found that rs1344706 was associated with differences in episodic and working memory performance in two independent SCZ samples. When subgroups of patients with lower intelligence quotients (IQs) were removed, the association was strengthened. Several studies have replicated this observation, suggesting that the rs1344706 risk allele (A) may increase susceptibility in a subtype of SCZ patients with better cognitive functioning (Becker et al., 2012;Chen et al., 2012;Van Den Bossche et al., 2012). In a large sample of healthy subjects, the rs1344706 risk allele was associated with a paranoid schizotypy phenotype that may reflect perturbed temporal and spatial unity of self (Sazci et al., 2012), a core feature of schizophrenia (Chapman et al., 1978;Lenzenweger, 1994;Stefanis et al., 2013). Another study of healthy individuals (Hargreaves et al., 2012) found that this variant was associated with the tendency to blame others, which is closely related to paranoid behaviour. Thus, rs1344706 might have an effect on cognitive and emotional characteristics that may be related to genetic vulnerability to psychosis.\nTwo studies documented an effect of rs1344706 on patterns of brain connectivity (Esslinger et al., 2009(Esslinger et al., , 2011)). An increased dose of the risk allele was associated with reduced inter-hemispheric coupling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at rest and during working memory and emotion-recognition tasks, and with greater prefrontal-hippocampal functional connectivity during the working memory task only. Another study reported a weak replication of the altered coupling between the right DLPFC and the hippocampus, but found no support for decreased coupling in the inter-hemispheric DLPFC (Rasetti et al., 2011). The risk allele is also associated with activation of the DLPFC during a cognitive control task (Thurin et al., 2013) and activation of brain networks subserving complex forms of cognition such as Theory of Mind (Walter et al., 2011).\nAn effect of the rs1344706-A allele on brain volume, especially white matter (WM) volume, has been reported in healthy individuals in samples of various size and power (Lencz et al., 2010, n ¼39;Wei et al., 2012, n ¼69;Wassink et al., 2012, n¼ 198) and in individuals with SCZ (Wassink et al., 2012, n ¼ 335). However, Donohoe et al. (2011) (n ¼70 patients and 38 controls) and Cousijn et al. (2012) (892 healthy individuals) found no association between rs1344706 and WM volume.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to the strength and direction of water diffusion in biological tissue, and provides measures of microstructural properties of the WM pathways that wire the brain. These measures include fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects the directional coherence of water diffusion, and radial diffusivity (RD), which reflects the strength of diffusion perpendicular to the primary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. DTI may thus be sensitive to a range of biological mechanisms involved in structural brain connectivity. DTI studies on 100 SCZ patients and 69 controls (Wei et al., 2013) and 62 healthy controls (Voineskos et al., 2011) reported no effect of the rs1344706 risk variant on white matter FA or RD. However, another study of 89 SCZ patients and 64 controls (Kuswanto et al., 2012) found an effect on WM microstructure in cortico-limbic circuits. It should be noted that these studies used relatively small samples.\nWe aimed to test the effect of rs1344706 on intermediate phenotypes that may be relevant to susceptibility to severe psychotic disorders in two independent, extensively phenotyped Scandinavian samples of healthy individuals. We looked for an association between rs1344706 and six cognitive traits reflecting cognitive domains that are consistently impaired in individuals with SCZ (Lesh et al., 2011;Keefe and Harvey, 2012). We also tested the effects of the SNP on inter-individual variability in microstructural properties of brain WM pathways as indexed by the DTI parameters FA and RD.",

    "Subjects": {
      "text": "Participants were drawn from the Norwegian Cognitive NeuroGenetics (NCNG) sample, which was recruited by advertisements in a local newspaper to take part in a larger community-based study on the genetics of cognition (Espeseth et al., 2012). All participants read an information sheet and signed a statement of informed consent approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (South-East Norway) (Project ID: S-03116). Permission to obtain and store blood samples for genotyping, as well as cognitive and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in a biobank, and to establish a registry with relevant information, was given by the Norwegian Department of Health. The research was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants were native speakers of Norwegian. All subjects were interviewed and screened for neurological or psychiatric diseases known to affect the central nervous system, and for history of substance abuse. Any person with a history of treatment for any of the above was excluded from further participation. In this study, we used 670 healthy individuals (457 females and 213 males, mean age 47.6, range 18 to 79 years old, SD ¼ 18.2) who have been tested for different cognitive abilities. All duplicates and samples belonging to closely related individuals (identity-by-state threshold Z 0.85) were removed. Additionally, samples with heterozygosity values greater than 2 standard deviations (SDs) (z-test, two-tailed P¼ 0.05) from the sample mean, or with sex discrepancies, were excluded. To ensure genetic homogeneity of the sample at the population level, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using 100 K random SNPs was performed to exclude possible non-Norwegian ancestors.\nAs a replication sample, another Scandinavian sample was used, comprising 1753 healthy Swedish individuals (1110 females and 643 males, mean age 65.7, range 45-90 years old; SD ¼ 13.58) from the Betula longitudinal study on memory, aging and health (Nilsson et al., 1997(Nilsson et al., , 2004)). To assess the quality and homogeneity of the sample, duplicates, closely related subjects (identity-by-state threshold Z0.85) and samples with heterozygosity values greater than 2 SDs (z-test, twotailed P ¼0.05) from the total sample mean were excluded. Possible non-Swedish ancestors were excluded through MDS analysis using 100 K random SNPs. These subjects underwent a stringent health and cognitive screening procedure and were assessed for a range of memory functions. In addition, for the DTI analysis we used a subsample of the Betula sample recruited in 2010 comprising 370 individuals who underwent an extensive brain-imaging protocol and from whom blood was taken for genotyping. Genotype and DTI data of sufficient quality were available from 250 subjects from the NCNG sample (166 females and 84 males, mean age 48.8, range 18-77 years old) and 340 subjects from the Betula sample (179 females and 161 males, mean age 62.8, range 25-81 years old).",

      "text": "The subjects included in the current study have been assessed using several cognitive tests. For the NCNG sample, six different tests were selected to best represent a range of cognitive functions that have been reported to show some level of impairment in psychiatric conditions. The tests were also filtered to keep those that have a comparable measure in the Betula sample. The following tests were thus selected: the Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning sub-tests from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (i.e., verbal abilities and reasoning), and also an estimated Intelligence Quotient (IQ) generated from these two measures (Wechsler, 1999). In addition, we used the total number of words learned across five trials (i.e., learning) and the delayed free recall score (i.e., delayed verbal memory) from the California Verbal Learning Test-II (Delis et al., 2000), and the third condition from the D-KEFS Colour-Word Interference Test (Stroop3) (i.e., speed of processing) (Delis et al., 2001). The assessment procedures are described in detail by Espeseth et al. (2012).\nThe replication analysis was performed using six cognitive tests included in the Betula protocol that assess analogous cognitive domains. These included the following: word comprehension test (i.e., verbal abilities) and block design (i.e., matrix reasoning) generating an estimated variable for full-scale IQ, immediate free recall (i.e., learning) and delayed cued recall (i.e., delayed verbal memory) of short sentences with or without enactment, and a letter digit substitution test (i.e., speed of processing). Further details of the assessment procedure are presented by Nilsson et al. (1997Nilsson et al. ( , 2004)).",

    "DNA extraction, genotyping and imputation": {
      "text": "Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard methodology. Genotyping of the rs1344706 SNP in individuals from the NCNG sample with available genetic material (600 out of 670) was carried out with a custom TaqMan s SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using 20 ng of genomic DNA in a total reaction volume of 2 ml. All the 600 available samples were successfully genotyped without any failures. The assays were amplified on an ABI 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and analysed with Sequence Detection Systems (SDS) Software v2.3, according to the suppliers protocol. The clusters were visually examined and manually adjusted if necessary. Since genotyping was not possible for 70 of the 670 NCNG DNA samples due to unavailability of genetic material, we used imputation information from our GWAS material (Espeseth et al., 2012) for the 70 untyped samples. The imputation was performed using MaCH v1.0 (Li et al., 2009(Li et al., , 2010) ) and Minimac (Howie et al., 2012). Preimputation quality control was carried out using PLINK v1.07 (http:pngu.mgh. harvard.edupurcellplink) (Purcell et al., 2007), removing SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) o0.01, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) P-value o0.001, and individual missingness 40.05. In addition, samples were removed from subsequent analysis if the heterozygosity values were greater than 2 SDs from the sample mean or if they had sex discrepancies. The 1000G Interim Phase I European haplotypes (http:www.sph.umich.educsgabecasisMACHdownload1000G-PhaseI-Interim. html) was used as reference for imputation. The rs1344706 variant was imputed with a high imputation quality showing an r 2 value of 0.997, which is an estimated squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes. The most likely genotypes were derived from the dosage values for subsequent analyses.\nGenotyping of the rs1344706 SNP in individuals from the Betula sample was performed as part of an Illumina iSelect project. These samples were subjected to a stringent quality control procedure, performed in PLINK. SNPs were filtered and excluded from the analysis if they had a failure rate of greater than 5, minor allele frequency (MAF) o 0.01 and HWE exact test P o0.001. After quality control checking of the iSelect genotyping data, 1753 individuals were successfully genotyped for the rs1344706 marker.\nGenotyping of rs1344706 in the Betula subsample with DTI phenotyping (n¼340) was extracted from a GWAS performed on that sample using Illumina Omni Express and Omni 1S Bead chip kits. The sample and genotyping quality checks were performed using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) and GenABEL (Aulchenko et al., 2007) software tools. Samples with call rates o0.97, with too high autosomal heterozygosity (FDR o 0.01) or with sex discrepancies were excluded. Population structure was assessed by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using 250 K random SNPs to exclude samples with possible non-Swedish ancestry. SNPs were filtered and excluded from the analysis if they had a call rate o 0.95, minor allele frequency (MAF) o 0.01 and HWE exact test Po 0.001. The final clean dataset consisted of 1.4 million SNPs in 360 individuals, 340 of which had also passed quality control for DTI measurements.",

For diffusion-weighted imaging, a single-shot twice-refocused spin-echo echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters was used: repetition time (TR)echo time (TE) ¼ 8590 ms87 ms, b-value ¼1000 smm 2 , voxel size ¼2.0 Â 2.0 Â 2.0 mm, and 64 axial slices. The sequence was repeated twice with 10 b ¼ 0 and 60 diffusion-weighted volumes per run. Further details of the NCNG imaging procedure are described by Westlye et al. (2012).\nFor Betula, DTI imaging was performed on a 3T Discovery MR750 (General Electric) scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Diffusion-weighted data with a spatial resolution of 0.98 Â 0.98 Â 2 mm were acquired by a single-shot, spinecho-planar T2-weighted sequence. The sequence parameters were as follows: TR¼ 8.0 s, 64 slices with no gap in between, 256 Â 256 matrix (field of view¼ 250 mm), 90 deg. flip angle, TE ¼ 84.4 ms, 3 repetitions of 32 independent directions, b¼ 1000 smm 2 and six b ¼0 images. All participants were scanned on the same scanner with no software or hardware update during the entire datacollection period. Further details of the Betula imaging protocol are described by Salami et al. (2012).\nAll DTI datasets were processed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Smith et al., 2004). Each volume was affine registered to the first b ¼ 0 volume using FMRIBs linear image registration tool (FLIRT) (Jenkinson et al., 2002) to correct for motion and eddy currents. After removal of non-brain tissue, FA (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996), eigenvector, and eigenvalue, maps were computed by linearly fitting a diffusion tensor to the data. We defined RD as the mean of the second and third eigenvalues ((λ 2 þ λ 3 )2).\nFA volumes were skeletonised and transformed into a common space as employed in Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006). All volumes were nonlinearly warped to the FMRIB58_FA template by use of local deformation procedures performed by FMRIBs nonlinear image registration tool (FNIRT). Next, a mean FA volume of all subjects was generated and thinned to create a mean FA skeleton representing the centres of all common tracts. We thresholded and binarised the mean skeleton at FA 4 0.25. Similar warping and analyses were employed on RD.",

Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) (Smith and Nichols, 2009) was used for statistical inference, with 5000 permutations performed for each contrast. The threshold for statistical P-value maps was Po 0.05, corrected.\nIn addition to the voxel-wise approach, FA and RD were averaged within large WM pathways as identified in digitalised probabilistic neuroanatomical atlases (Mori et al., 2005;Wakana et al., 2007;Hua et al., 2008) and used for estimation of commonly reported effect sizes. Note that the formal statistical testing was performed voxel-wise and that the additional region-of-interest (ROI)-based analyses were done to ease comparison with previous and future studies.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The SNP rs1344706, located in an intron of the ZNF804A gene, has previously been associated with SCZ and BPD, and several cognitive and brain-imaging traits often implicated in psychiatric disorders. Here we report that this SNP has no significant impact on a range of cognitive traits or on DTI indices of brain WM microstructure in two independent Scandinavian samples of healthy individuals.\nPrevious studies linking this genetic variant to risk of developing psychiatric disorders and differences in cognitive or imaging traits have produced both positive and negative results. Inconsistent reports of effects are frequently observed in association studies and can arise for different reasons. Inconsistencies can result from lack of power in the different studies, leading to type I or II errors. In particular, for the DTI traits, our sample is the biggest ever examined for association with rs1344706. Our DTI results are in agreement with some studies (Sprooten et al., 2012;Voineskos et al., 2011) which found no effect of the variant on WM tract structure in a sample of healthy individuals. Considering that other studies have reported association between the risk allele and specific cognitive measures and imaging traits, it is also possible that the effects of this variant are specific for certain phenotypes or to certain subgroups of patients. In studies of the effect of rs1344706, Walters et al. (2010) reported that the effect was stronger in patients with SCZ with higher IQ. Since our sample of healthy individuals is of limited size, we did not look at the effect of IQ, mainly for power reasons. However, it will indeed be interesting to perform this analysis when larger samples with IQ information become available.\nThe samples tested here are larger than those used in similar previously reported studies, and are relatively homogenous in terms of population origin, imaging processing and comparability of several of the cognitive tests. It must be noted, however, that our study suffers from limitations such as variability between sites in the collection of data (environmental, technical, intrinsic and individual variations). In addition, even though it is well established that cognitive traits are highly heritable and some studies have reported effects of genetic variants on cognitive traits, it is clear from recent studies such as those on fluid intelligence (Lencz et al., 2014) or school attainment (Rietveld et al., 2013) that genetic effects on cognitive variability are very small and will probably need samples even larger than ours to rule out type I or II errors. Furthermore, in contrast with most studies, where patient cohorts were used to assess the association of rs1344706 with cognitive abilities, all individuals in the current sample were healthy. The hypothesis for testing healthy samples is that variants implicated in cognitive dysfunctions in patients should also be implicated in inter-individual variability in cognition if we consider the trait to be quantitative and dysfunctions to be part of the variability range. It might be, however, that the effect of the variant is specific to cases and cannot be seen in healthy individuals.\nInconsistent results can also be due to allelic heterogeneity, whereby different genetic variants in the ZNF804A locus have an effect depending on the genetic structure of the study population or on the phenotype being analysed. We did examine the effect of 35 SNPs within the ZNF804A genotyped in the NCNG sample as part of a GWAS (Espeseth et al., 2012), and none of the SNPs showed significant association with any of the cognitive traits tested (data not shown). We conclude that the rs1344706 SNP had no effect in our two independent samples of 250 and 340 individuals for DTI traits and of 670 and 1753 individuals for cognitive traits, and that in these samples, the included phenotypes provide no further information about the genetic effect of this variant on psychiatric disorders.",

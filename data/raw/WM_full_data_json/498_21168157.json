    "abstract": "Regional atrophy of gray matter (GM) in Alzheimers disease (AD) is well known; however, the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic changes of cerebral white matter (WM) is uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of GM, WM atrophy, and microscopic WM changes in the same individuals with AD. All subjects (10 AD and 15 healthy controls HC) underwent a MRI scanning at 1.5 T, including a 3-dimensional volumetric scan and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed statistical parametric mapping (SPM) with DTI to evaluate the patterns of the microscopic WM changes, as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for GM and WM volume changes between patients with AD and HC. GM atrophy was detected, mainly in posterior regions, and WM atrophy was similarly distributed, but less involved on VBM analysis. Unlike WM atrophy on VBM analysis, microscopic WM changes were shown in the medial frontal, orbitofrontal, splenium of the corpus callosum, and cingulum on DTI analysis with SPM. We demonstrated that the pattern of macroscopic WM atrophy was similar to GM atrophy, while microscopic WM changes had a different pattern and distribution. Our findings suggest that WM atrophy may preferentially reflect the secondary changes of GM atrophy, while microscopic WM changes start earlier in frontal areas before GM and WM atrophy can be detected macroscopically.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in studies involving patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) because it can noninvasively quantify gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) integrity with high reproducibility 1. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated, objective method of examining voxelbased GM or WM differences across the entire brain in different populations 2,3. Although several studies have reported GM and WM differences between patients with AD and normal controls using VBM 45678910111213, the presence and extent of WM atrophy has not been determined, indicating that macroscopic WM atrophy measured using region of interest or VBM methods does not truly reflect microscopic WM changes. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to overcome this limitation. The strengths of DTI are that it reflects the size, orientation, and organization of WM tracts non-invasively by measuring the random motion of water molecules as well as it is capable of assessing microstructural properties of WM, which can provide information in addition to macrostructural properties. Moreover, the voxel-based analytic method can also be applied to DTI analysis, and studies have successfully demonstrated regional microscopic alterations of WM in patients with AD 151617.\nThis study investigated the pattern of GM and WM atrophy in patients with AD using VBM. Furthermore, by using DTI with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), we assessed regional microscopic WM changes and compared WM atrophy and microscopic WM changes in the same individuals simultaneously. We performed this study to examine whether there is an anatomic correspondence between regions of GM atrophy, WM atrophy, and microscopic WM changes.",

Second, all images were normalized spatially using SPM2 built-in routines to compare groups. Third, each normalized image was segmented into GM and WM compartments 2. Fourth, these normalized images, and the GM and WM segments, were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 10 mm full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM), to reduce inter-individual gyral variation, and individual global counts were normalized by proportional scaling to a mean value of 5.0. Finally, all smoothed images were averaged in turn to create an SPM T1 template, and GM and WM templates.",

The DTI, GM, and WM images were analyzed separately. A two-sample t-test was applied to determine significant regional differences between the two subject groups for both GM and WM regions. The ventricle size was entered as a covariate to correct for regional atrophy and head size variation in each subject. The threshold for the results was set at an uncorrected P b 0.001 and an extended threshold of 50 contiguous voxels was applied. The anatomical location of voxels demonstrating a significant difference between the two groups was determined by converting the x, y, and z coordinates for the peak voxel within a cluster from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates used in SPM2 analyses, to Talairach coordinates 21 using the MNItoTAL software (http:www.mrc.cbu.cam.ac.ukImagingmnispace.html).

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "This study measured both macroscopic GM and WM atrophy and microscopic WM changes in the same subjects simultaneously. We found that the microscopic WM changes measured by DTI differed in space, that were more widespread than the macroscopic WM changes measured by VBM in patients with AD compared to controls.\nGM volume was lost in the bilateral temporoparietal areas and left splenium of the CC, which is a posterior pattern. These findings correspond with those of earlier studies 7,13,14,23, which indicated that the medial and lateral temporal regions were the sites most vulnerable to early involvement and greatest atrophy in patients with AD. When considering the results of the macroscopic WM volume changes, atrophy was evident in the left hippocampus, splenium of the CC, and posterior cingulum; it was similar to the pattern of GM volume loss, but the distribution was smaller and it had a laterality trend (more on the left side), which has been supported in several VBM studies 15,17,242526. It has been suggested that macroscopic WM atrophy results primarily from Wallerian degeneration, secondary to cortical atrophy 24,27, combined with other AD pathology. The selective damage of the WM was probably associated with the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid plaque in the cortex and among the interconnecting WM fibers. In the presence of GM degeneration, alterations in the quantity of WM likely reflect processes of demyelination and neuronal loss, which will eventually result in macroscopic WM atrophy.\nWhen considering the microscopic WM volume changes seen in the DTI analysis, the regional FA reductions that we found in this study likely reflect WM changes due to the underlying pathological processes, such as demyelination, axonal loss, and amyloid β deposition. Indeed, the FA and MD abnormalities in the DTI analysis were distinct from the WM atrophy on VBM analysis. The FA changes were distributed not only in posterior regions, including the hippocampi and splenium of the CC, but also in anterior regions, such as the MF and OF areas, as seen in previous DTI studies 28,29. Undoubtedly, the FA, MD, and volume change of the WM in the splenium of the CC explained the inter-connection fiber damage secondary to the neuronal damage in the temporo-parietal associative cortices 27. By contrast, the results revealed an incongruence in the frontal region between the macroscopic and microscopic changes in the WM. One explanation for this incongruence may be that regional WM atrophy is secondary to GM volume change, rather than reflecting preceding microscopic WM changes directly. Because DTI is a more sensitive method for detecting WM damage than other MRI images, such as FLAIR or T1, DTI can detect microscopic WM changes that may precede macroscopic WM atrophy in the frontal area. This finding is supported by the frontal hypometabolism seen in 18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 30313233, high Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) uptake in the frontal area in PIB PET 34, or frontal executive dysfunction in neuropsychological testing in early-stage AD. In other words, the pathology begins in the WM tracts, and that the disconnection between cortical regions is responsible for the reduced glucose uptake. In a previous neuropathological study of AD patients, Braak and Braak demonstrated amyloid β and NFT deposition in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, in stages V and VI 35. The WM damage could result from direct damage to the axon caused by NFT deposition within the neurons, or secondary changes of neuronal damage caused by toxic amyloid β deposition outside the neurons, and this may be detected by DTI in the frontal regions before WM atrophy can be detected by VBM analysis.\nSome limitations of this study need to be considered. First, the cross-sectional design is a weakness because the decreases in brain structures seen in cross-sectional designs are not the same as longitudinal decreases, and may reflect sampling biases. Second, the sample size is small, so these results need to be interpreted with caution. Third, from a methodological perspective, the template normalization steps result in less precise anatomic specificity than manual tracing 2, especially for very small subcortical structures; however, for many regions that are difficult to trace, VBM provides useful information on both whole-brain and regional GM and WM integrity. The registration of atrophic brains to a standardized template can cause segmentation errors based on a template of normal young brains. We measured the total intracranial volume and lateral and third ventricular areas, which were used as covariates to correct for regional atrophy and size variation of the head. Fourth, because we did not perform tractography or Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) for minimizing the problem that border voxels can often be included in analyses, one must carefully interpret whether the changes in FA based on a voxel-based comparison are fully representative of the WM tract density. Despite these limitations, a strength of our study was that it measured GM and WM morphometric changes and microscopic alterations of WM concurrently in the same AD participants.\nTaken together, the combined VBM and DTI imaging methods could play a significant role in a comprehensive understanding of regional patterns in GM atrophy, and macroscopic and microscopic WM alterations in the same individuals with AD. The patterns of regional GM and WM atrophy are consistent with the current knowledge of the progression of AD pathology, which involves mechanisms of regional brain atrophy, Wallerian degeneration, and brain disconnection. The differences of microscopic WM atrophy in frontal areas between AD patients and controls reflect region-specific degeneration due to the AD process. If adding longitudinal studies, these results may suggest that microscopic WM changes in frontal areas precede macroscopic alterations in the same region, which could reflect functional or metabolic dysfunction in AD. Further longitudinal and pathological research is needed to explore the pattern and the order of WM and GM changes.",

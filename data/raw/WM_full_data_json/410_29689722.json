    "abstract": "Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have higher probability to develop Alzheimers disease (AD) than elderly controls. The detection of subtle changes in brain structure associated with disease progression and the development of tools to identify patients at high risk for dementia in a short time is crucial. Here, we used probabilistic white matter (WM) tractography to explore microstructural alterations within the main association, limbic, and commissural pathways in aMCI patients who converted to AD after 1 year follow-up (MCI converters ) and those who remained stable (MCI stable ). Both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters have been considered for a comprehensive pathophysiological characterization of the WM damage. Overall, tract-specific parameters derived from qMT and DTI at baseline were able to differentiate aMCI patients who converted to AD from those who remained stable in time. In particular, the qMT exchange rate, RM B 0 , of the right uncinate fasciculus was significantly decreased in MCI converters , whereas fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in the bilateral superior cingulum in MCI converters compared to MCI stable . These results confirm the involvement of WM and particularly of association fibers in the progression of AD, highlighting disconnection as a potential mechanism.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment of amnestic type (aMCI) is considered a pre-dementia phase, highly predictive of subsequent conversion to Alzheimers disease (AD) 1. Nonetheless, aMCI is a fairly heterogeneous condition 2,3, including not only patients at an early AD stage, but also patients who will remain stable, and patients at risk for developing other forms of dementia 4. Determining the biophysical sensitivity and specificity of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to AD pathology is essential to develop effective imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. While regional assessments of grey matter (GM) atrophy are sensitive to macroscopic changes occurring at relatively advanced phases of the disease 5,6, this approach is unable to highlight microstructural alterations that accompany and may well precede volume loss. The hypothesis that disconnection may be a contributor to the spread of damage in AD brains is increasingly gaining consensus 7, thus implying that early changes within the white matter (WM) tracts might play a crucial role in the onset and early progression of AD 789, up to the hypothesis that myelin breakdown might be implicated in the pathogenesis of AD 10. This view is supported by evidence of microstructural changes occurring in the WM already in pre-clinical stages of AD 11. It still remains to be established, however, whether WM microstructural changes are a primary event, or secondary to GM atrophy 12.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging are among the most popular MRI techniques for assessing WM changes. They are sensitive to micro-structural and metabolic changes, and therefore might provide more accurate prognostic information than atrophy assessment on its own. DTI allows the estimation of a number of indices of microstructural integrity of WM fiber tracts 13,14. Among those, fractional anisotropy (FA) reflects the coherence of the orientation of water diffusion, and its variation is influenced by different factors including myelination, axon density, axonal membrane integrity, and axon diameter 15,16. Mean diffusivity (MD) is determined by the density of physical obstructions to diffusion such as membranes, and quantifies the resultant distribution of water molecules between different cell compartments 16. Higher MD values indicate increased diffusion which suggests tissue breakdown and increased brain water content 15. As diverse pathological events can lead to similar changes in the observed FA and MD, it was proposed that parameters quantifying separately the diffusivity along and across WM tractsnamely axial diffusivity (ADif) and radial diffusivity (RDif)-can be more informative about the integrity of axons versus their surrounding myelin sheaths 17. Increased RDif has been linked to loss of myelin in animal studies of experimentally induced myelin loss 171819, while a decrease in ADif has been reported in both rodents and humans with axonal damage associated with axonal swelling, fragmentation and organelle accumulations 19,20.\nMT imaging is based on the exchange of magnetization between protons in tissue water (liquid pool) and those bound to macromolecules (macromolecular pool). In particular, as some evidence suggests that molecules associated with myelin dominate the MT exchange process in WM, it is conceivable that this technique may provide information about myelin integrity. A simple way to quantify this effect is the MT ratio (MTR) 21, which has been extensively applied to the study of neurological conditions, including dementia. Previous investigations have demonstrated reductions of the MTR in the brain of patients with AD 22,23 and associations between MTR and measures of global cognitive impairment 242526, suggesting that the MTR is sensitive to at least some of the pathological processes characterizing AD. The MTR value, however, is the result of the combination of several more fundamental quantities, and it is known to be affected also by inflammation, T1 changes, and pH 27. Quantitative MT (qMT) 28 is an extension of MT imaging which attempts to overcome the limitation of MTR by quantifying the physical properties that govern the MT process, including the relaxation rates of the pools, the exchange rate, and the relative size of the macromolecular pool. These parameters deliver information closely related to biological changes of WM and GM, and are therefore of potential interest in several neurological disorders. In particular, preliminary studies suggest that qMT might provide complementary information to that offered by other MRI techniques in the characterization of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD 23,29,30.\nPostmortem studies 31 and animal studies 323334 indicate that one of the parameters obtained from qMT, the relative size of the macromolecular pool, or F, is proportional to myelin content in WM 35, while preliminary studies indicates that another qMT parameter, namely the forward exchange rate, RM 0 B , might be more sensitive to AD pathology 29,30. The interpretation of RM 0 B is uncertain, as the exact mechanisms of MT are still unknown. Based on results obtained in the cortex of patients with AD, it was suggested that it might reflect metabolic abnormalities 30, while recent reports indicate that it might be related to mild inflammatory changes 36,37.\nHere, we combined DTI and qMT to provide a detailed examination of WM abnormalities in aMCI. Our primary aim was to identify tract-specific biomarkers obtained from DTI and qMT able to predict the conversion to AD in patients with aMCI over 1 year. In addition, secondary aims were 1) to assess the microstructural damage of the WM tracts which were recently shown to be involved in AD pathophysiology 38 in patients with MCI; and 2) to evaluate the relationship between qMT and DTI indices within those tracts. Our attention has focused on the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus, whose early involvement in AD pathology and relation to cognitive decline has been described by previous studies 9,39. The inferior longitudinal fasciculus has also been considered, given its proximity in the anterior part to the uncinate fasciculus.",

      "text": "A cohort of 43 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD 40, 34 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (as classified following the original Mayo Clinic criteria; 41), and 21 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled for this study. To classify our MCI patients as a prodromal-AD group, we adopted two main criteria: 1) patients had to report subjective memory impairment at clinical onset, corroborated by an assistant, and confirmed by performances below the normality cut-off scores on at least one of the administered tests for episodic memory; 2) their MRI profile had to be compatible with prodromal-AD (i.e., structural alterations in temporal areas).\nPatients were reviewed after 1 year, in order to assess whether they had converted to AD or remained stable. Patients were recruited from the specialist dementia clinic of the Catholic University of Rome (Rome, Italy). All patients had a typical clinical onset of AD, characterized by episodic memory deficits. The principal demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1.\naMCI patients were identified according to current criteria 41. They had to report a subjective memory impairment corroborated by an assistant and confirmed by performance below the normality cut off scores on at least one of the administered tests for episodic memory (see Table 2), and all MCI patients had not to fulfil the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for the diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorders 42. This criterion was confirmed by reporting normal scores at the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 43,44 (Italian normality cut-off score  23.8) 45 and at all tests of the neuropsychological battery assessing cognitive functions other than episodic memory (Table 2). Finally, the memory deficits observed in aMCI patients had to result in no or in a very mild impact on their daily living activities, as confirmed by their total Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score 46 which had not to exceed 0.5. None of the aMCI patients was either under anticholinesterase or neuroleptic medication. Patients with probable AD were diagnosed according to the clinical criteria established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCD-SADRDA) 40.\nHC were enrolled among patients relatives and spouses. HC had to report no previous complaint suggestive of cognitive impairment, and they had to score within the range of normality at every administered neuropsychological test (Table 2).\nAll recruited subjects had to be right-handed, in order to reduce any potential source of variability due to hemispheric dominance. Major systemic, psychiatric, and other neurological illnesses were carefully investigated and excluded in all the stud- Available cut-off scores of normality (95 of the lower tolerance limit of the normal population distribution) are also reported for each test.\nied subjects.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study sought to identify alterations in WM tracts, measurable in the brain of MCI patients up to a year before they converted to AD. In order to capture the full extent of WM changes in aMCI and AD, we considered both DTI and qMT indices in the major tracts involved in AD: inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior and superior cingulum and uncinate fasciculus.\nA number of major results emerged. First, we identified 2 potential biomarkes of conversion to AD: FA in supCi and RM 0 B in UF, which can differentiate MCI converters from MCI stable already at baseline. Both UF and the cingulum are known to be involved in AD pathology 39,64,65. The UF is one of principal pathways of connection between temporal and frontal lobes, and therefore damage to this tract might explain some aspects of memory impairment, such as those related with encoding and retrieval of new material 66,67. Previous studies have also postulated a role for the UF as predictor of the conversion from aMCI to AD 68, and this tract has been linked to memory and emotional recognition alterations in aMCI 69. Interestingly, a previous study from our group showed that damage to the UF, by means of reduced FA, was measurable in patients with AD, but not in those with MCI 39. The cingulum bundle is the major median associative WM fasciculus reciprocally connecting various frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. It is part of both, the executive control and default mode networks, which are responsible for executive function, memory and other cognitive functions 70. The damage in the cingulum has been found to correlate with measures of cognitive impairment 71, and we have previously shown that it correlates with atrophy of the nearby GM structures 9. It is therefore unsurprising that measures of microstructural damage to this tract can be sensitive to the conversion to AD.\nIn line with these findings, we show that, at baseline, MCI converters already show some microstructural differences compared to HC, which resemble those exhibited by AD patients. This result matches what has already been shown for GM atrophy 5, i.e., that MCI who are about to convert to AD will show a degree of tissue damage comparable to AD patients prior to conversion, while such damage is undetectable in those MCI patients who remain stable. Interestingly, these WM abnormalities can be detected by the DTI indices MD, RDif and ADif, and by the qMT parameters RM 0 B , but not by FA or F. This probably indicates a pathological substrate of inflammatory nature, with no frank demyelination or tissue loss. MCI stable only show signs of mild microstructural damage when compared to HC, evidenced by an increase in ADif in infCi and UF. The interpretation of these findings is highly speculative, as we cannot be sure whether this group of patient will ever develop a form of dementia. However, if we were to hypothesize that they represent a group of very early AD patients, the involvement of these tracts fits with the frequently reported (and above discussed) evidence of microstructural damage to the cingulum and the UF in AD patients 9,39 and MCI 68,72. Anyhow, the lack of a control tract in our analyses (i.e., a tract of no-interest) does not allow us to conclude about the focal involvement of these tracts in early AD pathology. Indeed, the possibility of a more generic disruption of the WM, that goes beyond the areas primarily damaged by AD degeneration, has been also recently suggested 73, supporting the view of AD as a disconnection syndrome 7.\nThe main novelty of this paper is in the combination of qMT and DTI parameters, and in the multi-parametric evaluation of the major WM tracts. The potential role of qMT in the evaluation of patients with AD was highlighted by three previous papers 23,29,30. Here we extended the analysis to the population of MCI individuals. Our data confirm the sensitivity of the parameter RM 0 B in detecting pathophysiological changes in AD 30.\nIn contrast to our initial hypothesis, F, which has been linked to myelin damage, was not sensitive to alterations in WM tracts, while the DTI parameter RDif, believed to also reflect myelin damage, showed some abnormalities in MCI converters . The lack of correlation between the two parameters, although unexpected, has been already described in other studies 32,74. The reason for such a discrepancy might be explained by the underlying physical principles between the two imaging techniques 33,74, where DTI indices reflect mainly the directionality of WM fibers whereas qMT parameters reflects tissue composition rather than spatial organization. An overall increase in diffusivity (which can be associated with tissue loss and inflammation) would also result in an increase of RDif, with no associated change in F.\nIn support of this speculation, values of RDif mostly correlated with values of RM 0 B in almost all tracts (but ILF right), suggesting that the two parameters might reflect similar, or highly linked, structural contributions to WM integrity in this sample. An intriguing speculation on the clinical relevance of the parameter RM 0 B in AD has been put forward in a previous study from our group 30, suggesting that this parameter might reflect some metabolic information 75 and supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction might play a relevant role in the pathophysiology of AD 76. Whereas this still remains a purely speculative explanation, it is worth noting that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to WM demyelination in multiple sclerosis 77,78, suggesting a similar mechanism in the WM damage in AD and providing a possible explanation of the correlation between RDif and RM 0 B indices in our study. Of note, changes in RM 0 B of the insular cortex were recently shown in experimentally induced systemic inflammation, and were interpreted as localized increase in metabolically-active macromolecules 36. This might also explain why in our study different indices of WM microstructure are more sensitive to the damage in different tracts. While part of it might be due to the different fiber architecture in the various tracts 79, other might be explained by the specific pathological process occurring in specific tracts. For example, UF carries cholinergic fibers from the basal nucleus of Meynert innervating frontal and temporal regions 80. The integrity of cholinergic system is highly vulnerable to metabolic state, suggesting again that RM 0 B (the most sensitive marker in spotting WM damage in UF when comparing MCI converters and MCI stable ) might be eloquent of underlying metabolic processes. In fact, the hypothesis of a cholinergic deficit in AD and its pathophysiological consequences have a long history. It is known that an impairment of cholinergic transmission one of the features of neurodegeneration which occurs early in AD, and the loss of cholinergic neurons and projections is well described in the AD pathology 81. Albeit these hypotheses are intriguing, further interpretations are beyond the scope of this study and future research is needed to investigate the clinical relevance of qMT parameters extracted from WM tracts.\nIn conclusion, our study reveals that qMT and DTI indices extracted from tractography are efficient in spotting the WM microstructural damage and are valid biomarkers of the conversion from MCI to AD. Combined with neuropsychological evaluation, the complementary information from these markers could be applied in future for the development of multivariate tools for the early identification of patients who are likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention.",

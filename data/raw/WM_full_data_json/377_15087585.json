    "Introduction": {
      "text": "The amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as a transitional stage between agerelated memory decline and Alzheimers disease (AD) in many patients 123. Several studies have been conducted in order to detect whether MCI corresponds to structural 4, neurochemical 5678 or neurophysiological 9,10 changes of the brain. Structural imaging studies showed temporal and particularly hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy in MCI patients 11.\nMoreover, hippocampal and entorhinal volumes seem to predict subsequent cognitive decline in AD 121314. Using fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography, glucose hypometabolism of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus 15, and the temporoparietal neocortex 16 have been shown to identify MCI patients and to predict the conversion to AD. It has been demonstrated with SPECT that MCI patients who subsequently converted to AD, showed hypoperfusion in the hippocampal-amygdaloid complex, the posterior cingulate, the anterior thalamus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus 17.\nNew MR techniques, however, such as magnetization transfer imaging 18,19 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), might improve our knowledge about ultrastructural brain tissue changes in MCI. Diffusion tensor MR imaging measures the random translational motion of water molecules. In structured tissues, like myelin fibers, this motion is restricted. The relative preference of the diffusion in fiber direction is called anisotropy. The degree of anisotropy is given as fractional anisotropy (FA) and can be calculated from the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor, which is used as a measure for white matter integrity. Mean diffusivity (MD) is a measure for randomized mean water diffusion. It can be used as a measure of alterations of brain tissues 20212223.\nIn healthy subjects, a decrease in white matter anisotropy and an increase in diffusivity has been identified as an age-related process 242526.\nIn AD patients, white matter structural changes are more severe as demonstrated in several DTI studies 272829303132 and are possibly due to central angiopathy and Wallerian degeneration 34,35. In particular, a decline in FA and an increase in MD in the corpus callosum as well as in the white matter of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes in patients with AD could be demonstrated 28. Others have shown reduced FA in the temporal white matter, the corpus callosum and in the anterior and posterior cingulum of AD patients 31. In a comparative study of MCI patients and healthy control subjects, an elevation of hip-pocampal diffusivity, measured as apparent diffusion coefficients, has been found 35,36. We expected that due to the neuropathological concept of MCI 1, the DTI technique might be efficiently used in MCI patients to detect early ultrastructural white matter damage of the brain.",

      "text": "We enrolled 14 patients with MCI 5 male, 9 female; age 68.2 (SD 9.2) years and 19 patients with AD 4 male, 15 female; age 69.6 (SD 8.3) years who consulted the University Memory Clinic for diagnostic evaluation of memory complaints, and 10 healthy controls 7 male, 3 female; age 62 (SD 6.8) years in this prospective study. All AD patients fulfilled the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria 37 for probable AD. MCI was defined according to Petersen et al. 2,3 (i.e., subjective complaints about memory loss, delayed verbal recall was at least 1.5 SD below the respective age norm, normal general cognitive performance, normal activities of daily living, no dementia) and a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 38. Diagnostic procedures comprised clinical psychiatric and neurological examinations and laboratory tests including vitamin B 12 , folate and thyroid hormones. The neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and delayed verbal recall test of the German version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers disease battery 39,40.\nThe diagnoses of arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, main vascular risk factors for atherosclerotic changes of cerebral blood vessels, were equally distributed in the three groups. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 5 of the 14 MCI patients (36), 7 of the 19 AD patients (37) and 4 of the 10 controls (40). Hypercholesterolemia was present in 4 of the MCI patients (29), 5 of the AD patients (26), and 2 of the 10 controls (20).\nPatients with metabolic diseases that could interfere with cognitive functioning and patients with other brain diseases or pathological brain scan findings including significant cerebrovascular diseases (cortical infarctions, multiple lacunar lesions, leukoaraiosis and other lesions above level 1 of the Schmidt-Fazekas classification 41) were excluded as well as patients with a diagnosis of present depression or dysthymia according to DSM-IV criteria.\nControl persons were recruited by advertisement and underwent a structured interview to exclude persons with complaints about cognitive functioning, substance abuse, depression, and symptoms of any cerebral diseases in the history. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all subjects gave their written informed consent.",

MD was defined as mean diffusion coefficient and calculated off-line from the mean eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor (D xx  D yy  D zz )3 given in mm²s and FA was defined as standard deviation of eigenvalues from the mean eigenvalue normalized by square norm of eigenvalues according to previous descriptions 20,42. After the calculation, both indices were plotted as MD and FA maps. Regions of interest (ROIs) of 15-25 pixels (48-80 mm 2 ) were placed into the hippocampi, the temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital white matter, the centrum semiovale and the corpus callosum (genu and splenium) of the T 2 -weighted images achieved with b  0 smm², and then transferred to the index maps (fig. 1).\nThe size of the ROIs depended on the anatomical region studied. The target was to obtain solely white matter areas and to avoid artifacts (especially susceptibility artifacts). The hippocampal ROIs were placed manually over the hippocampal heads in order to exclude perihippocampal cerebrospinal fluid spaces.",

      "text": "As depicted in table 1, mean age did not differ significantly between MCI patients and controls, but did so between AD and controls. Neuropsychological test results demonstrated significantly different cognitive functioning levels of AD patients, MCI patients and healthy controls (table 1).\nIn MCI patients, MD values were increased in the centrum semiovale (left p  0.013; right p  0.026), in the left hippocampus (p  0.002; fig. 2) and the temporal white matter (left p  0.006; right p  0.014) compared to controls (table 2). FA values did not significantly differ between MCI patients and controls -only a statistical trend finding was observed in the left hippocampus, which pointed into the same direction as the finding in AD patients (table 2).\nIn AD patients, MD values were increased in the left centrum semiovale (p  0.012), in the left hippocampus (p  0.002; fig. 2), and in the parietal (left p  0.001; right p  0.028) and temporal white matter tracts (left p  0.018; right p  0.011) compared to the control group (table 2). FA values of AD patients were decreased in the area of the left temporal white matter (p  0.017) and the left hippocampus (p  0.031) compared to controls (table 3).\nThere were no differences between MCI patients and AD patients regarding MD and FA values that had achieved statistical significance (tables 2, 3).\nWe calculated univariate ANCOVAs for MD and FA values with gender and age as covariates. No independent influence of these variables could be detected for the regions with significant group differences.\nTo assess the utility of the DTI technique for diagnosing MCI, sensitivity was calculated for MD values of the left hippocampus only. By setting the specificity at 80, which means that 8 of 10 controls were correctly assigned as negative with a cutoff value of 853 ! 10 -6 mm 2 ! s -1 , the sensitivity of distinguishing MCI patients from controls was 71.4.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "The aim of the study was to investigate whether a new assessment procedure of DTI-derived data could be useful to detect morphological white matter and hippocampal brain tissue damages in patients with MCI 1. This technique allows to identify changes in diffusion characteristics of brain tissue, which occur as a consequence of loss of barriers restricting water molecule motion, as it could be expected in neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, alterations of white matter integrity that are found due to Wallerian degeneration and other white matter damages (e.g. demyelinating processes) can be detected with DTI 20,21,23.\nDuring neurodegeneration, cell loss leads to increased diffusion of water molecules that can be quantified by elevated MD values. In contrast, processes that lead to disturbances of white matter homogeneity can be expressed by decreased FA values, indicating violation of white matter integrity in the brain. In early AD, neuronal degen- ! s -1 ! 10 -3 . Univariate analyses with gender and age as covariates (ANCOVA) showed no independent influence for the regions with significant group differences. FA is given as SD of eigenvalues (EV) from the mean EV normalized by square norm of EV. Univariate analyses with gender and age as covariates (ANCOVA) showed no independent influence for the regions with significant group differences.\nFellgiebelWilleMüllerWinterer ScheurichVucurevicSchmidtStoeter eration is typical for hippocampal and entorhinal areas and is expanding into temporal and parietal association cortices 43. Therefore, it can be assumed that altered white matter diffusivity in temporal and parietal lobes due to Wallerian degeneration 33,34,44 can be detected particularly well by MD evaluations. Since extracellular amyloid deposits could have an impact on increased water diffusion of brain tissue, especially in hippocampal areas, they might contribute to MD elevation.\nThe main result of our investigation was in line with our expectation in yielding significant elevations of MD values in MCI patients as compared to controls in parietal, temporal and left hippocampal regions. Our findings indicate that morphological alterations are most pronounced in the left hippocampus, but also found in other regions that are typically altered in early stages of the disease 42,45,46. The increased diffusivity of the left hippocampus in MCI patients (p  0.002) suggests pronounced neurodegeneration in this area (fig. 2). The sensitivity of 71.4 (at a specificity of 80) of left hippocampal MD for distinction between MCI patients and healthy controls suggests a possible diagnostic utility of the DTI method for this indication. In contrast, FA values of MCI patients did only numerically but not significantly differ from controls. This indicates a relatively preserved integrity of white matter tracts in this stage of the disease when memory function is already clearly disturbed.\nThe first DTI data of MCI patients showed elevated diffusivity measured as apparent diffusion coefficients only in hippocampal regions 35. One possible reason for the discrepancy between findings in this and our study, i.e., the restriction of the pathological finding to the hippocampal areas in the previous study, might be that MCI patients in this study were less severely impaired (mean MMSE score: 26.8) than the MCI patients in our study group (mean MMSE score: 24.6). Second, our MCI patients and control subjects were younger (mean age: 68.2 vs. 62 years) than in the earlier investigation (mean age: 81.3 vs. 81.4 years). Thus, the generally observed agerelated increase in diffusivity might have confounded the disease-related alterations more extensively in the former study.\nOur findings are also supported by other investigations of MCI patients with structural and functional brain imaging techniques. Using whole brain volumetric magnetization transfer imaging, widespread structural brain damage associated with decreased cognitive functioning in MCI patients have been demonstrated 18,19. ADtypical patterns of glucose hypometabolism have been found in 10 of 20 patients with MCI in temporoparietal brain regions 16. Other studies have also demonstrated reduced glucose metabolism in left temporoparietal areas of MCI patients 47 and have found a significant ADtypical (temporoparietal) glucose hypometabolism in 19 and nonsignificant hypometabolism in 17 of MCI patients 48.\nMoving to AD patients, these subjects showed elevated MD values in parietal, temporal and left hippocampal regions, suggesting temporal white matter and left hippocampal tissue damage. The decrement of white matter anisotropy that we found in left temporal white matter of AD patients indicates disturbed integrity of white matter tracts in these regions. These findings are in accordance with those of several other investigators 17,27,29. Furthermore, we found reduced anisotropy in the area of left hippocampus in AD patients compared to controls. One could interpret this finding as an indication for advanced disturbance of white matter integrity of the hippocampus. In MCI patients, hippocampal anisotropy was also numerically reduced compared to controls, but this reduction failed to be statistically significant.\nTaken together, elevated diffusivity indices such as increased MD seem to indicate ultrastructural white matter changes in MCI as well as in AD in a more sensitive way than FA decrement. For the group of AD patients, this finding had already been obtained and an increase in MD as well as a decrease in FA values could be demonstrated 28. The alterations of diffusivity in our MCI patients support the notion that white matter changes in AD that are secondary to Wallerian degeneration and neuronal loss in cortical associative areas do already begin in many patients with MCI symptoms. There is increasing evidence that cerebrovascular pathophysiology plays an important role in the development and clinical course of AD 495051. It is likely that beside Wallerian degeneration local microvascular changes also contribute to the pathological white matter alterations we detected by means of DTI.\nIn conclusion, DTI, especially mean diffusivity measurement, seems to be a helpful diagnostic tool to detect ultrastructural, degenerative or vascular white matter alterations in MCI patients. Our data could serve as validation of the amnestic MCI concept on an ultrastructural neuroimaging level. This conclusion is limited by the small number of enrolled patients and controls. Further evaluations of DTI in MCI subjects and AD patients have to be done, especially longitudinal assessments to calculate sensitivity, specificity and cutoff values of DTI parameters to predict transition from MCI to AD.",

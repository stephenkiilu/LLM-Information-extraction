    "abstract": "Introduction AD affects not only the cerebral cortex but also the underlying WM (Brun and Englund, 1986) . The confirmation of clinically diagnosed AD is made neuropathologically when the typical lesions of plaques, tangles and neuronal loss are observed in grey matter regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala and temporal parietal cortex (Brun and Englund, 1981) . The classical clinical profile of AD is largely dependent on the severity and distribution of the grey matter pathology. However, WM changes are also often observed in AD, as seen in structural imaging and neuropathological examination (",

      "text": "White matter (WM) changes are frequently seen on structural imaging in AD but the clinical relevance of these changes is uncertain. Frontal WM pathology is often observed upon neuropathological examination in AD. Since frontal corticalsub-cortical pathology is known to relate to executive dysfunction, the aim was to elucidate if frontal WM changes in AD correlated with executive dysfunction. In all, 15 AD patients and 15 age-matched control cases were investigated in the study, which covered conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DTI, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations. Reduced performance on neuropsychological testing of executive function correlated significantly with an increasing degree of frontal WM changes detected by DTI in the AD group, while no such correlation was observed for the controls. Conventional semi-quantitative MRI assessment did not correlate with results on neuropsychological testing of executive function in any of the groups. The structural correlate to certain dimensions of executive dysfunction in AD patients could be related to changes in the deep frontal WM. DTI appears to be more sensitive in the detection of clinically significant WM alterations than conventional semi-quantitative MRI.\nß 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Postmortem DTI has been found to correlate with in vivo DTI results (Guilfoyle et al., 2003) as well as with true WM pathology observed in the microscope (Englund et al., 2004;Larsson et al., 2004). DTI could thus enable the detection of earlymild WMD in AD patients that could have a direct bearing on the clinical presentation. DTI is believed to show changes of the WM tracts in aging (Moseley, 2002;Head et al., 2004;Salat et al., 2005), ischemic vascular disease (Sotak, 2002;OSullivan et al., 2004) and AD (Bozzali et al., 2002;Takahashi et al., 2002;Medina et al., 2006). In a recent study, variations in measures of DTI of normal appearing frontal WM has been reported to correlate with tests of executive function in a combined group of patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Huang and Auchus, 2007).",

The selected patients had mild or moderate AD (mean mini mental state examination  MMSE score 23.5 AE 1.09, Table 1) (Folstein et al., 1975). Duration of dementia was estimated as the time from the first recorded symptom of cognitive impairment (mean  3.4 years, range 1.5-9.0 years, Table 1).\nPatients with significant cerebrovascularneurological disease, e.g., subdural hematoma, cerebral hypertensive edema and larger cortical or subcortical infarcts on computed tomography (CT) or MRI were excluded. All participating patients had a low Hachinski score, well below the criteria of vascular dementia (Table 1). Consequently, individuals with pure AD and minimal or no cerebrovascular pathology were included.\nPatients who had significant visual or hearing impairment or dysphasia, markedly inflicting on neuropsychological testing were excluded. Furthermore, patients with claustrophobia, anxiety, benign vertigo, pacemaker devices or other implanted foreign metal were also excluded from the study, as such conditions preclude MRI.\nThe clinical diagnosis of AD was based on clinicalneuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations and was further corroborated by structural imaging (CT or MRI), regional cerebral blood flow measurements (SPECT) and tau-and b-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid. All cases met with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). After the inclusion, all participating patients underwent standardized clinicalneuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations as well as MRI including DTI.

The tests were: the trail making test (TMT) A and B (TMT  time in seconds to complete the motor sequence to connect circles with increasing numbers and letters) assessing attention processes, visual scanning and search skills as well as motor speed and coordination (Reitan, 1955); the color naming part of the Stroop test (time in seconds to give the color of a number of dots) assessing attention and mental speed (Stroop, 1935;MacLeod, 1991); the verbal fluency test (VFT) (naming as many words as possible beginning with the letter a in 60 s) evaluating phonemic verbal fluency (Lezak, 2004c). Due to cognitive impairment, six of the AD patients could not complete the TMT-B and therefore, this test was not used in the subsequent analysis. Due to cognitive impairment, one of the AD patients could neither complete the TMT-A nor the Stroop test and yet another patient was unable to complete the Stroop test.",

Full brain coverage was obtained for the 2D sequences by scanning 23 slices with a slice thickness of 5 mm and for the 3D sequence by scanning a volume generating 160 slices with a slice thickness of 1 mm.\nBilateral, frontal and occipital WM was graded for WM alterations on the conventional T1 and T2 weighted images using the Wahlund scale for WM changes (Wahlund et al., 2001). The use of a 3 T MRI scanner with its high resolution, made it possible to detect lesions with a minimum size of 3 mm instead of the 5 mm limit proposed by Wahlund et al. (2001).\nThe AD patients were investigated with MRI on the same day that the neuropsychological and neuropsychiatricclinical examinations were performed.

Slice positioning was axial and identical to that of the 2D conventional protocols with 23 slices and a slice thickness of 5 mm. Post-processing of diffusion images was carried out using a diffusion-analysis program (developed inhouse) based on interactive data language (IDL, ß Research Systems, Inc.) allowing pixel-wise calculation of the fractional anisotropy (FA) index (Basser, 1995).\nThe FA value is an index of the anisotropy in the tissue analyzed on a scale from 0 to 1, where zero denotes diffusion of water molecules equal in all directions and one denotes a great, directional movement of water molecules along one axis. The ordered structure of brain WM with axons and myelin sheaths allows for the molecules to diffuse in preferential directions, and the resultant FA is relatively higher than in disorganized tissue, such as in WM affected by pathology (Basser, 1995;Le Bihan et al., 2001;Horsfield and Jones, 2002).\nEvaluation of the calculated FA maps were performed using regions of interest (ROIs) positioned in frontal and occipital WM. The occipital ROIs were used as reference since neuropathological studies suggest that this region is relatively less affected by WMD in AD (Sjobeck et al., 2006).\nAltogether, 4 ROIs were placed in each case on a midaxial slice through the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes and basal ganglia. Two ROIs were placed bilaterally in the deep frontal WM anterior to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. The anatomical distinction of the rectangular frontal ROI was defined by the anterior border of the frontal horn, the deepest lateral sulcus and finally the deepest anterior sulcus present on the slice (Fig. 1). Two further ROIs were placed in the right and left occipital WM, respectively (Fig. 1). Here, the anatomical distinction of the ROI was defined by the anterior occipital sulcus and the calcarine sulcus.",

    "WM changes, MRI, DTI and executive dysfunction": {
      "text": "One of the main findings of the present study was that the FA values were significantly reduced in frontal and occipital lobe WM in AD patients compared to the controls. This is in agreement with previous DTI studies (Bozzali et al., 2002;Takahashi et al., 2002;Medina et al., 2006), which have shown reduced FA values in AD compared to healthy control cases. This finding is also partly supported by neuropathological studies, which suggests an involvement of primarily the anterior WM in AD (Brun and Englund, 1986;Sjobeck et al., 2006). However, in contrast to these neuropathological findings, the present study shows, in terms of FA values, relatively more involvement of the occipital WM than the frontal WM comparing AD and control cases (Fig. 2).\nAnother main finding was that the performance in neuropsychological testing of executive function utilizing the TMT-A correlated with WM changes, as detected by reduced FA values on DTI in the deep frontal WM in AD (Fig. 4). This is to our knowledge the first time that frontal WM changes detected by DTI have been found to correlate with impaired executive performance in a homogenous group of AD. However, DTI variables of normal appearing frontal WM have been reported to correlate with tests of executive function in a combined group of patients with AD and MCI (Huang and Auchus, 2007). Furthermore, previous studies have shown correlation between WM changes on conventional MRI as well as on DTI and executive function in ischemic vascular disease, such as stroke and ischemic leukoaraiosis (Vataja et al., 2003;OSullivan et al., 2004).\nIn the present study, conventional MRI did not show any significant correlation with results from the executive tests in either AD or control cases. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in WM changes on conventional MRI between the groups. One explanation for the observed difference in correlations between executive function and conventional MRI on the one hand, and DTI on the other, could be that DTI is in fact more sensitive to mild WM changes, as shown previously (OSullivan et al., 2004). However, it is necessary to perform further studies on the sensitivity and specificity of conventional MRI and DTI for detecting significant WM changes and also more studies on the corresponding neuropathology.\nStudies utilizing conventional MRI to assess WM changes often include a larger study population than that of the present study. Despite the limited number of cases in the present study, there was a statistical significant correlation regarding DTI. Conventional MRI evaluation of WM changes is often semi-quantitative (Scheltens et al., 1998;Wahlund et al., 2001), utilizing scales with a narrow range, rendering few observational steps and perhaps not differentiating mild changes (Scarpelli et al., 1994). The evaluation of FA could in this context be more objective, and the broader observational range might, at least in part, explain the observed correlations with the results from neuropsychological testing.\nThe three selected neuropsychological tests used in the present study assess different dimensions of executive functions such as attention processes, visual scanning, motor speed, coordination and phonemic verbal fluency. While there were no significant relations between FA values in the deep frontal WM and results from either the Verbal Fluency or the Stroop test in the AD group, there was a significant relation between frontal FA values and results on the TMT A test (Table 4). Several studies have shown a consistent pattern of activity in the dorsolateral frontal regions associated with the performance of the VFT. Activation changes in the anterior cingulate cortex have been observed in the execution of the Stroop test (Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000). The TMT is the only test in our test battery that requires coordination between visual search and motor performance (Lezak, 2004b), and is likely to involve subcortical connections. The discrepancy in correlations between the tests used in the present study could thus be explained by the fact that the tests cover partly different brain structures. The significant relation between the performance on TMT A and the FA values in the selected frontal regions in AD patients suggests that this dimension of executive function is especially dependent on intact fronto-subcortical tracts. Furthermore, the results suggest that the TMT is a particularly sensitive test to assess executive function in AD related to frontal WM changes, also demonstrated by others (Huang and Auchus, 2007).",

    "DTI results, aging and the pathogenesis of WMD in AD": {
      "text": "FA values or similar anisotropy values have been observed to be reduced in normal aging (Moseley, 2002;Head et al., 2004;Salat et al., 2005), especially in the frontal WM. These findings are partly supported by the present study. Reduced frontal FA values correlated with increasing age in the AD group, but not in the control cases. One possible interpretation could be that age-related physiological changes and AD pathology concur and have a synergistic effect on the frontal WM. An individual of higher age is likely to suffer more damage from AD than a younger one, since age-related effects have already reduced the brain capacity (Brun, 2004). Another interpretation, based on the assumption that the duration of clinical dysfunction due to AD would correlate with FA values, appeared unlikely in this study. The explanation for the lack of correlation between age and FA values in the control group in the present study could be that the age range (66-86 years) was too narrow to observe any potential influence of age. This assumption is supported by the findings by Salat et al. (2005) who demonstrated a correlation between frontal FA values and age in healthy subjects from 21 to 76 years of age.\nIn neuropathological studies, the severity of WMD has been found not to correlate with the severity of cortical AD pathology (Brun and Englund, 1986;Sjobeck and Englund, 2003). This implies that factors other than direct cortical AD neurodegeneration link the AD process with the WMD. In line with this, the amount of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and severity of WMD has been observed to correlate in AD (Haglund and Englund, 2002). Furthermore, it has been found that decreasing numbers of small vessels in the WM parallel increasing severity of WMD (Sjobeck et al., 2003). Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis of an alleged ischemic-hypoperfusive origin of the incomplete infarction of WMD in AD. However, it remains to establish whether DTI verified WM changes relate to neuropathologically defined WMD.",

It is proposed that certain dimensions of the executive dysfunction often observed in AD could, at least partly, be related to changes in the deep frontal WM and that these changes in AD are accentuated by increasing age.",

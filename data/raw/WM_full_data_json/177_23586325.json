      "text": "TAR DNA binding protein 43 kD (TDP-43) is the principal protein inclusion in ALS and in a subgroup of FTD cases (8). Moreover, a common expansion in the intron of C9orf72 on chromosome 9 (9p21) has been identifi ed in families affected by ALS, FTD or ALS-FTD (1).\nCentral to the advanced neuroimaging fi ndings has been the use of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which has rapidly become an important non-invasive tool for characterization of white matter (WM) structures through the visualization and evaluation of fi bre tracts connecting cortical and subcortical regions. Specifi cally, the most commonly used technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), enables the assessment of WM pathways integrity by measuring water diffusion properties and is represented by three eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues from which fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial (AD), radial (RD) and mean (MD) diffusivity derive (9,10). DTI has already produced promising results in assessing widespread WM pathology in patients with ALS (11 -20), most of which mainly refer to changes in FA and MD (11,13 -20) refl ecting, respectively, directional changes in water diffusivity and the average of diffusion in all directions (9,10). Conversely, only few studies have shown a signifi cant increase of AD (12,13), which refl ects axonal damage (9), andor RD (12 -15,19), the most accepted myelin related measure (21,22), along both motor and extramotor fi bre pathways in ALS.\nMost of these studies have reported changes of FA mainly in the CSTs, but also in the corpus callosum (CC) (12,14 -16,18,19) and the frontal and temporal lobes (14 -16,18 -20), detecting signifi cant correlations of FA with duration, progression, and severity of the disease within and also beyond motor areas (11,13 -15,17,18,20).\nRecently, insights into corticomotor connectivity changes in ALS have been derived by acquiring high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) scans along with high-resolution structural images (sMRI), confi rming and magnifying previous DTI results (23). As an alternative DW-MRI approach, the HARDI technique allows to overcome DTI limitations in the analysis of crossing fi bres (24). In particular, the major shortcoming of DTI is the limitation in resolving individual fi bre orientations within voxels containing fi bres with more than one orientation.\nConversely, HARDI allows to evaluate diffusion attenuation in many more angular directions, dozens or even hundreds, and also allows to resolve the orientations of multiple fi bre populations coexisting in the same voxel (24). Among the several HARDI techniques, Q-ball imaging (QBI) has shown to be the most sensitive to multimodal diffusion along WM fi bres (25).\nThe present work is based on a QBI HARDI approach, aiming to investigate the integrity of motor and extramotor WM pathways in a group of patients with sporadic ALS also in advanced stages of disease and to correlate generalized FA (GFA), the most prominent and widely accepted QBI parameter, with clinical measures of UMN impairment, disability and frontal dysfunction.",

      "text": "We studied 19 patients with ALS (nine males, ten females; mean age 61.1 Ϯ 11.2 years), with defi nite ( n ϭ 9) or probable ( n ϭ 10) sporadic ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria of the World Federation of Neurology (26). The mean disease duration, estimated from the time of symptoms onset to scanning, was 4.1 Ϯ 3.6 years. All had a  classic  phenotype with bulbar signs present in nine patients including also long-term survivors. Specifi cally, eight patients had a survival Ն 4 years, two of whom were receiving artifi cial respiratory support (non-invasive ventilation; mean duration, 68 months). We excluded patients with non-classical phenotypes (i.e. dominant lower motor neuron impairment, such as progressive muscular atrophy, fl ail leg syndrome or pseudopolyneuritic form) or with other motor neuron diseases (i.e. progressive bulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis, post-poliomyelitis ALS and ALSdementia).\nIn all patients we assessed the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) for evaluating and monitoring ALS related disability (27); the Frontal Systems Behaviour (FrSBe) scale for estimating the degree of frontal dysfunction through the evaluation of total or T-score, derived from the caregiver form and referring to the present time (28); and the UMN score, a measure of pyramidal dysfunction based on a scale used in previous ALS neuroimaging studies (14,29). Specifi cally, this score evaluates the number of pathologic refl exes, elicited from 15 body sites -glabellum, orbicularis oris, masseter (jaw jerk), biceps, triceps and fi nger jerks bilaterally, and knee, ankle, and Babinski responses bilaterally.\nWe have not administered our patients the frontal assessment battery (FAB) (30), because the ALS related physical symptoms could have signifi cantly affected the score. However, all patients underwent a prescreening neuropsychological evaluation, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (31) and phonemic and semantic fl uency tasks (32,33), and performed in the normal range (for more details see Table I). Moreover, in our sample we found a mild prevalence of UMN signs and a frontal executive and behavioural impairment (Table I).\nAll patients were treated with riluzole (50 mg ϫ twoday). No patient had familial ALS or was positive for mutations of most genes causative for ALS (i.e. superoxide dismutase-1 or SOD1, transactive response DNA-binding protein or TARDBP, fused in sarcomatranslocated in liposarcoma or FUSTLS and C9orf72).\nThe control group comprised 19 healthy controls (nine males, ten females) aged from 46 to 78 years (mean age 62.1 Ϯ 8.5 years) with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases and without any abnormalities detected on conventional MRI T1 and T2 weighted images. All 38 subjects included in the study were right-handed.\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second University of Naples and was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.

For this purpose, GFA images of all subjects ( n ϭ 38) were aligned to a common target (FMRIB58_FA standard space) using non-linear registration, and thereby GFA maps were calculated using the FSL FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) tool and aligned to a 1 ϫ 1 ϫ 1 mm MNI 152 standard space. A mean GFA skeleton was then created with threshold of GFA Ͼ 0.1. Voxelwise correlations were performed to relate GFA to the clinical scores of disability (UMN score, ALSFRS-R, FrSBe scale). The resulting statistical maps were thresholded at p Ͻ 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons at a cluster level using the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach (34). Age was used as covariate. A VOI analysis was also performed to correlate the TBSS results with standard anatomic VOI data.

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "ALS has been commonly regarded as a neurodegenerative disorder primarily involving the pyramidal system, but there is growing evidence that degenerative changes can occur elsewhere in the central nervous system.\nRecently, the extensive application of advanced MRI techniques to the study of ALS has undoubtedly improved the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and in particular the spreading of the neurodegenerative process from motor toward extramotor systems (4,7).\nIn our study we depicted whole brain GFA changes in advanced stages of ALS by using a QBI model as the HARDI method and provided additional information on the extent of the neurodegenerative process with respect to earlier DW-MRI studies. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other paper addressing WM pathways  abnormality in ALS by applying HARDI along with high resolution sMRI and whole brain probabilistic tractography (23).\nInterestingly, comparing ALS patients with controls, our voxelwise analysis of GFA maps resembles the intra-(i.e. between the left and right precentral gyri and the brainstem) and inter-hemispheric (i.e. between the right and left anterior cingulate gyri) abnormalities of WM pathways previously detected by a different HARDI approach (23).\nThe need for using a multitensorial DWI approach, such as HARDI, for depicting and tracking axonal fi bre tracts was originated by the limitations of DTI, which is based on a conventional single-tensor model and then does not take into account multiple fi bres crossing within single voxels (37). The Gaussian tensor model assumes a unimodal displacement probability distribution, where the principal eigenvector is coaligned with the dominant fi bre orientation within a voxel. Therefore, considering that over one-third of voxels in the brain exhibits marked deviations from the Gaussian diffusion behaviour, DTI is not ideal for completely characterizing the location and orientation of brain fi bres (24,38). This diffi culty is particularly evident when attempting to reconstruct the motor pathways, especially regarding the face and tongue regions (39). The major fi bre bundles, such as the callosal fi bres and superior longitudinal fasciculi, cross the motor tracts at the level of the centrum semiovale and, therefore, when these fi bre bundles intersect within a voxel, the DTI model is not adequate to comprehensively describe the anatomical connectivity of this voxel (37).\nThese constraints have been overcome by HARDI methodology, which proved to be effi cient in the detection of subtle axonal connections in the brain (25), as well as in the spinal cord (40), mainly by using a novel reconstruction model, such as QBI (25). Specifi cally, this reconstruction method is considerably more time-effi cient and practical for routine investigative purposes than other q-space imaging techniques, although less informative about complex tissue microstructure properties (25). The study of congenital (41,42), neoplastic (39) and post-traumatic (43) brain and spinal cord abnormalities by HARDI is relatively recent, and in particular there are few applications to the investigation of the neurodegenerative process in experimental (43) and clinical ( 23) conditions.\nA number of non-ALS studies have shown the advantages of using the HARDI approach. In healthy subjects, a magnifi cation of the frontopontinecrossing motor fi bres in the midbrain has been observed by using HARDI (25). In brain tumour patients, the depiction of the motor pathway by using a conventional DTI model resulted to be less sensitive than HARDI in detecting corticospinal tracts abnormalities (39). In cases of partial agenesia of the CC, HARDI allowed to depict many more heterotopic tracts compared to DTI (42). Furthermore, with regard to extramotor fi bre tracts, in healthy subjects HARDI proved superior to DTI in depicting microstructural changes in regions supposed or known to have more crossing fi bres, such as cingulate gyrus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus (38).\nAgainst this background we designed our study, believing that HARDI could be a valuable tool for investigating in vivo the pathological process in ALS. However, although the present work does not aim to compare QBI and DTI models when applied to ALS, we have preliminarily generated FA maps submitted to the same TBSS pipeline of GFA maps, and have observed that the main differences between the two models in TBSS results were in regions supposed or known to have many crossing fi bres, particularly in anterior thalamic radiations, cingulate gyrus and uncinate fasciculus, more impaired in ALS patients compared with controls in GFA maps (data not shown).\nWith respect to GFA measures within the CTSs, the signifi cant decrease of GFA in ALS patients compared with controls, observed within both rostral (underneath the primary motor cortices) and caudal (at the left ponto-mesencephalic junction) WM tracts, confi rms and strengthens previous DTI TBSS results (14,15,18,34). This pattern of widespread microstructural impairment of the CSTs might be interpreted as an advanced stage of pathology characterized by a wider extension of the degenerative process, similar to what has been reported in post mortem examinations of patients with sporadic ALS, especially in case of long survival (3,44). Moreover, the signifi cant correlation between GFA at the left ponto-mesenchephalic junction along the CSTs and UMN score is consistent with previous DTI correlation analyses reporting signifi cant correlations between FA and clinical indices of pyramidal impairment in the brainstem (11,34).\nIn our group of patients with ALS we showed a reduced GFA also in the CC, mainly in its body, which negatively correlated with clinical UMN involvement. These results are consistent with previous DTI studies about the CC impairment in ALS (12,14 -16,18,19,23), although signifi cant correlations between changes of FA and UMN impairment have been mostly detected in the CSTs but not in the CC (14,16,18). We argue that these diverging results depend on: the different clinical characteristics of the patients enrolled (i.e. predominantly upper or lower motor neuron signs and different disease duration or disability); the weakness of clinical scores for the detection of specifi c UMN impairment (45); and the different methodologies used. Although our results should be further validated, they underline the crucial role of CC impairment as a neuroradiologic marker of UMN disease.\nThe reduction of GFA in the body of CC, including its midbody that is substantially formed by interhemispheric fi bres connecting the motor cortices (46), and in both cranial and caudal parts of the CSTs, is probably the result of a prevalent axonal loss within the motor fi bre pathway, as also demonstrated by neuropathological evidence (3,45). Specifi cally, our data corroborate the recent concept of the CC as a conduit for the spread of pathology from one hemisphere to the other (47). In agreement with our fi ndings, several clinical studies have demonstrated an impaired interhemispheric inhibition in ALS even at an early stage of disease progression, which could be mediated by CC impairment and associated with detection of mirror movements (48,49).\nWith respect to extramotor WM pathways, we found a more widespread pattern of WM impairment in the medial frontal lobes compared to what was revealed by previous DWI measures (i.e. GFA decrease in CC, anterior cingulate and uncinate, inferior fronto-occipital and superior longitudinal fasciculi), while we found an inverse correlation between the FrSBe T-score and GFA changes only in the CC and superior longitudinal fasciculus. It is worth speculating that such a pattern of predominantly frontal WM injury, also described in other cohorts of patients with ALS (50,51), may refl ect the executive and behavioural dysfunctions that characterize our patients. Along this line of evidence, our fi ndings reinforce the patterns of degeneration detected by DTI analyses in patients with ALS (13,15,52,53) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (53) or both (53,54), supporting the concept of a continuum between ALS and FTD not only on a pathological and genetic level, but also on a microstructural degeneration level (1). In this regard, a recent structural neuroimaging study using voxel based morphometry (VBM) and DTI in the three subtypes of the ALS-FTD continuum (i.e. ALS, ALS-FTD and FTD) revealed that anterior cingulate, premotor and motor areas as well as their underlying WM tracts were equally affected across the three diseases, in keeping with features common to the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (53). Speculatively, this overlap of structural changes across the three ALS-FTD subtypes may be related to the speed of evolution of the common cortical TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology that leads to rapid dissolution of cortico-cortical connections and might infl uence the clinical presentation with motor symptoms andor behavioural manifestations (8).\nThe correlation between GFA and FrSBe T-scores in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus found in the present study might corroborate previous evidence about the linkage between extramotor WM tracts degeneration and neuropsychological defi cits detected in patients with ALS (20,52,55).\nImportantly, a recent structural study showed that anterior cingulate atrophy was closely related to the degree of apathy in ALS patients (55), apathy being the most prominent behavioural symptom reported in ALS (51). However, only Tsujimoto et al. (20) observed in early stages of ALS a significant inverse correlation between the FrSBe scale (considering the subscore of apathy alone) and FA values within the WM underneath the frontal lobes, mainly in the right medial frontal gyri, without detecting in these regions a signifi cant decrease of WM volumes. In agreement with the latter results, in a more advanced stage of disease and contrary to what was revealed in terms of diffusivity, we did not detect signifi cant WM atrophy in the medial frontal lobes when comparing patients with controls by a VBM analysis (SPM8 software package (www.fi l. ion.ucl. ac.ukspm) (data not shown). We speculate that this discrepancy between VBM and diffusivity fi ndings in the medial frontal lobes might be indicative of an early active degeneration process detected by DWI at a stage when volumetric changes have not yet occurred.\nThe lack of signifi cant correlations between GFA and ALSFRS-R score or disease progression rate in our work is in agreement with previous studies reporting an absence or low levels of signifi cance for the correlations between DTI parameters and clinical assessment (12,16,17,19,23). The limited numbers of patients studied, the heterogeneity of their clinical presentations, and in particular the variance in lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement that contributes signifi cantly to the ALSFRS-R score, may probably impact on the signifi cance levels of these correlations.\nOur study has some limitations. First, to fully evaluate the power of this structural analysis method, our QBI analysis needs to be expanded on a larger cohort of patients, possibly scanned with more diffusion gradient directions. We must take into account that our sample of ALS patients, albeit small, covers many disease features, especially in the advanced stages. Secondly, we cannot determine with certainty the correlation between GFA changes and cognitive impairment, as we did not perform a complete neuropsychological assessment.\nIn summary, this study shows that the QBI HARDI analysis holds important promise for gaining additional insights into knowledge of the neurodegenerative process affecting the brain of patients with ALS. The major fi ndings are the motor and extramotor frontal diffusivity abnormalities potentially underlying the behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions and the evidence of a neurodegenerative pattern showing a spatial distribution similar to what was previously described in the ALS-FTD continuum. Future studies should aim to correlate these structural fi ndings, involving both motor and extramotor WM pathways, with clinical and functional data, by analysing groups of several ALS subtypes or phenotypes in early stages of disease to identify non-invasive markers of ALS neurodegeneration in larger serial and multimodal MRI analyses.",

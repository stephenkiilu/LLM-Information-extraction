    "abstract": "Background: Late Onset Bipolar Disorder (LOBD) is the arousal of Bipolar Disorder (BD) at old age (60) without any previous history of disorders. LOBD is often difficult to distinguish from degenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer Disease (AD), due to comorbidities and common cognitive symptoms. Moreover, LOBD prevalence is increasing due to population aging. Biomarkers extracted from blood plasma are not discriminant because both pathologies share pathophysiological features related to neuroinflammation, therefore we look for anatomical features highly correlated with blood biomarkers that allow accurate diagnosis prediction. This may shed some light on the basic biological mechanisms leading to one or another disease. Moreover, accurate diagnosis is needed to select the best personalized treatment. Objective: We look for white matter features which are correlated with blood plasma biomarkers (inflammatory and neurotrophic) discriminating LOBD from AD. Materials: A sample of healthy controls (HC) (n19), AD patients (n35), and BD patients (n24) has been recruited at the Alava University Hospital. Plasma biomarkers have been obtained at recruitment time. Diffusion weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are obtained for each subject. Methods: DWI is preprocessed to obtain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, which is reduced to fractional anisotropy (FA) data. In the selection phase, eigenanatomy finds FA eigenvolumes maximally correlated with plasma biomarkers by partial sparse canonical correlation analysis (PSCCAN). In the analysis phase, we take the eigenvolume projection coefficients as the classification features, carrying out cross-validation of support vector machine (SVM) to obtain discrimination power of each biomarker effects. The John Hopkins Universtiy white matter atlas is used to provide anatomical localizations of the detected feature clusters. Results: Classification results show that one specific biomarker of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde MDA) gives the best classification performance ( accuracy 85, F-score 86, sensitivity, and specificity 87, ) in the discrimination of AD and LOBD. Discriminating features appear to be localized in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and superior corona radiata. Conclusion: It is feasible to support contrast diagnosis among LOBD and AD by means of predictive classifiers based on eigenanatomy features computed from FA imaging correlated to plasma biomarkers. In addition, white matter eigenanatomy localizations offer some new avenues to assess the differential pathophysiology of LOBD and AD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mood disorder associated with cognitive, affective and functional impairment, often appearing at youth (age around 20 years), or even earlier 1, which has been considered as a risk factor for developing dementia 2. Dementia syndrome arising as a result of a history of bipolarity does not correspond to the criteria of Alzheimers disease (AD) 3. However, late onset (i.e. age60 years) BD (LOBD) 4 may be difficult to differentiate from behavioral impairment associated with Alzheimers disease (AD), because they share overlapping symptoms and neuropathology, including cognitive impairment, emotional disturbances, neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity and upregulated brain metabolism 5,6. LOBD challenges the established viewpoint considering that AD and BD are distinct and unrelated clinical entities. Recent works 7,8,44454647, have been addressing the question from the point of view of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on imaging data. In spite of the good classification performances, results lack interpretability in terms of the anatomical localization of the effects. Also, they are unrelated to other potential disease biomarkers.\nInflammation and oxidative stress have been found as common pathopshysiological processes underlying AD 91011, and BD 1213141516, as well as many other neuropsychological illness, such as depression and mania 17181920. These neurological disorders seem to be epigenetically linked to decreased transcriptional activity. It has been observed in both BD and AD patients that the frontal cortex exhibits an altered epigenetic regulation related to neuroinflammation, synaptic integrity and neuroprotection, and that oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of both diseases through similar mechanisms 21. The question addressed in this paper is whether there are common or differential pathophysiological effects revealed by correlation with plasma biomarkers, and their potential localization in the white matter structures.\nEigenanatomy 22,23 is a sparse dimensional reduction procedure, which enhances detection power and interpretability by computing correlation with a priori relevant variables. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), which have a global support, in eigenanatomy procedures the sparseness constraint implies that effects are localized in compact clusters. In this regard it is similar to sparse PCA. Moreover, eigenanatomy is a canonical correlation analysis (CCA), searching for projection directions with the maximal Pearsons correlation between the eigenvectors and some a priori relevant variables, subject to a sparseness constraint, hence it is a sparse CCA (SCCA). The approach also allows to introduce smoothness and cluster size conditions, such that the spurious small detections are removed. Eigenanatomy has been successfully applied to longitudinal cortical change detection 22,24 , validation of a new cognitive scale 25, multimodal medical image analysis 26, and parcellation of functional imaging based on a priori region labeling.\nOur study looks for the localization of white matter effects correlated with biomarkers applying an eigenanatomy feature extraction. Predictive CAD systems have been proposed to improve the diagnostic accuracy complementing the neuropsychological assessments carried out by expert clinicians 8,22232425. Accurate diagnosis is crucial to mitigate negative effects of inappropriate treatments. The classification performance achieved by machine learning based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) on eigenanatomy projection coefficients is used as a post hoc analysis that measures the detection power for each blood biomarker.",

    "MATERIAL AND METHODS": {
      "text": "The overall process is composed of selection and analysis phases. The selection phase corresponds to the eigenanatomy algorithm, which looks for sparse pseudo-eigenvectors of the fractional anisotropy (FA) volumes most correlated with the each blood biomarker. The region localizations take the form of sparse eigenvolumes, thus each subject FA volume can be expressed as a linear combination of them. The analysis phase is carried out as a classification experiment where the features are the coefficients of the linear combination, i.e. the projections of the subject FA volume onto each eigenvol-ume. The classification performance thus provides the discrimination power of each blood biomarker as a measure of their biomarker detection power. Therefore, classification and eigenanatomy analysis are independent processes, so that no circularity effect is incurred. Also, blood biomarkers cannot be included as classification feature because they have been used for selection. Performing the eigenanatomy over all the data we are working on the assumption that all data lie in the same subspace, which is a natural assumption. It can be argued that we are in a very subtle way using information about the test data in the training. However, besides the computational cost, performing eigenanatomy per each cross-validation folder will be a very noisy process due to the small sample size. Summarizing, the process carried out is as follows: (a) DWI data is preprocessed and converted to FA volumes, (b) eigenanatomy takes the FA volumes and each blood biomarker values, producing a collection sparse eigenvolumes and the projection coefficients, (c) the class information and the projection coefficients enter classification cross-validation experiments. Finally, (d) we examine the anatomical localization of the FA eigenvolumes clusters to report relevant findings.",

The BD group fulfills the DSM IV criteria and the AD group fulfills the NINDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Subjects with psychiatric disorders (i.e. major depression) or other conditions (i.e. brain tumors) were not considered for this study. The exclusion criteria were ongoing infections, fever, allergies, or the presence of other serious medical conditions (autoimmune, cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, and chronic infectious diseases and neoplasms). Neither the patients nor the healthy control subjects were receiving immunosuppressive drugs or vaccinations for at least 6 months prior to inclusion in the study or anti-inflammatory analgesics the 2 days prior to the extraction of the blood sample. The ethics committee of the Alava University Hospital, Spain has approved this study. All patients gave their written consent to participate in the study, which was conducted according to the provisions of the Helsinki declaration. After written informed consent was obtained, venous blood samples (10 mL) were collected from the volunteers, after which the mood scales and cognitive tests were performed.

After extracting plasma from blood samples, inflammatory cytokines Interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNFα) were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Oxido nitrosative parameters (nitrites and malondialdehyde (MDA)) were also analyzed in plasma samples. Cytokine levels were measured by EIA using reagents in kit form for TNFα (cat. 589201), Interleukin-1β (cat. 583311) (IL1β) and Interleukin 6 (cat. 501030) (IL6) from Cayman Chemical Europe, Tallinn, Estonia. Plasma levels of TNFα, IL1β and IL6 were measured in a 96-well plate and read at 405 nm following manufacturers instructions. Nitrites (NO - 2 ), the final and stable product of nitric oxide, were measured using the Griess method, where samples are incubated in acidic solution with sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDA). The nitrites are converted into a pink compound that is measured photometrically at 540nm (Synergy 2, Biotek).

The projection coefficients of the images into PSCCAN pseudoeigenvectors are used as feature vectors for classification. The computation of PSCCAN pseudo-eigenvectors does not use class information. It can be assumed as a class independent data transformation, hence the entire process has no circularity because selection (i.e. eigenanatomy) is independent of analysis (i.e. classification). Therefore PSCCAN can be performed once for all cross-validation experiment. In the experiments we have set to 12 the number of sparse pseudoeigenvectors, and sparseness ratio is set to s0.1, after a heuristic exploration of the localization results obtained with several setting of these parameters.",

In brief, SVM builds a supervised two-class classifier that separating training data samples with the maximal margin hyperplane achieving maximal generalization to new unseen data samples. The hyperplane discrimination function is defined by a set of support vectors, often localized at the boundaries between classes. The kernel trick allows define a linear discriminant in a high dimensional space, effectively obtaining a nonlinear discriminant function when the data is not linearly separable. Training of SVM classifier is achieved by quadratic programming, minimizing the norm of the discriminating hyperplane parameters, subject to classification error constraints. Linear SVM have two advantages: (a) It does not require kernel parameters model selection, thus introduces no bias in the training process due to fortunate model selection, which often is tricky, (b) Allows to focus on the relative detection power associated to the features proposed, not in the optimal classifier, assuming that feature performance ranking will be invariant to the classifiers. Nevertheless, at reviewers request and for the sake of completeness we report also results with radial basis function RBF SVMs.",

We provide the results for linear SVM and the best RBF SVM results. It is easy to assess that there is a significant improvement (t-test, p0.001) of non-linear SVM at the cost of careful model search. However, these results do not change the relative order of blood biomarkers, hence for our purposes linear SVM provides the same information as nonlinear SVM. Best discrimination of AD vs. LOBD is achieved on the feature vectors extracted from MDA, this result is statistically significant (F test computed over of all paired results per biomarker, p0.01) for all performance measures. This result is the best overall, achieving more than 85 average accuracy. In independent experiments using biomarker values as classification features the accuracy in the AD vs. LOBD classification achieved was 71 and 61 for the linear and RBF SVM, respectively. Therefore, eigenanatomy greatly boosts the discrimination power. Regarding HC vs. AD, both MDA and IL6 provide the best features, a t-test computed over their paired results shows no significant difference between them (p0.1). We think that features providing performance results below 70 are too weak to attribute them discrimination power. Discrimination of joint AD and LOBD from HC is very weakly achieved, maybe due to the SVM sensitivity to unbalanced datasets, pointing to the lack of a common pathophysiological source. Another",

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "This study was designed to investigate the localization in brain white matter of effects related to plasma biomarkers by eigenanatomy analysis 22,23 that may offer insights on the common and differential pathophysiological effects of LOOBD and AD 333435, which may allow a more accurate diagnosis supported by computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems on the eigenanatomy coefficients. This study was motived by the increasing prevalence of LOBD and the fact that it shares many diagnostic features with AD 4,363738. To our knowledge this is the first such study analyzing a wide range of biological (inflammatory, oxido-nitrosative and neurotrophic) measures for this purpose.\nPeripheral markers related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotrophins have been related to clinical symptoms, cognitive decline and illness severity in BD 1,39 as well as in AD 40. It has been suggested that inflammation and oxidative stress do not cause AD or BD by themselves, but probably during aging they reinforce many interdependent factors related to these complex neuropsychiatric disorders 3.\nIn the present study, most of the classification performance results for the baseline linear SVM classifier were well below 80, which indicates very low detection power of the pseudo-eigenvectors. The only exception are the features correlated with the oxidative stress marker MDA. Cross-validation experiments with non-linear SVM carried at the request of the reviewers did improve results significantly with the additional cost of model selection. Moreover, the relative order of the biomarkers features was not affected, so the qualitative information is the same for linear and nonlinear SVM. Therefore, localizations reported in Table 3 for MDA have some additional value over the other biomarkers. The main effects are found in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and its retrolenticular part, which are strongly related to the sensory and motor areas, probably related to the degeneration of these abilities, which maybe common to both LOBD and AD, as well as aged controls. Interesting effects are found in the Superior longitudinal fasciculus containing connections between the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. This network has been suggested to be involved in attention and language, motor behavior and somatosensory information. Abnormalities in these tracts may be related to some of the cognitive deficits found in BD 41 and cognitive performance in AD 42. Interestingly, MDA is not related to the corpus callosum structures, so that no effect on interhemispheric communication are detected by our approach, because other biomarkers which show some localizations in the corpus callosum have very low classification performance. Finally, superior corona radiata effects are to be expected as it has been observed that aging has a definitive effect on DTI in this white matter structure 43, nevertheless it deserves further exploration in order to assess which role they play in the discrimination between LOBD and AD.",

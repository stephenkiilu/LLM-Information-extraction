    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate microstructural characteristics of the corpus callosum using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their relationships to cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Methods Seventy-five participants with PD and 24 healthy control (HC) participants underwent structural MRI brain scans including DTI sequences and clinical and neuropsychological evaluations. Using Movement Disorder Society criteria, PD participants were classified as having normal cognition (PD-NC, n  23), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n  35), or dementia (PDD, n  17). Cognitive domain (attentionworking memory, executive function, language, memory, visuospatial function) z scores were calculated. DTI scalar values, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were established for 5 callosal segments on a midsagittal plane, single slice using a topographically derived parcellation method. Scalar values were compared among participant groups. Regression analyses were performed on cognitive domain z scores and DTI metrics. Results Participants with PD showed increased AD values in the anterior 3 callosal segments compared to healthy controls. Participants with PDD had significantly increased AD, MD, and RD in the anterior 2 segments compared to participants with PD-NC and most anterior segment compared to participants with PD-MCI. FA values did not differ significantly between participants with PD and participants with HC or among PD cognitive groups. The strongest associations for the DTI metrics and cognitive performance occurred in the most anterior and most posterior callosal segments, and also reflected fronto-striatal and posterior cortical type cognitive deficits, respectively. Conclusions Microstructural white matter abnormalities of the corpus callosum, as measured by DTI, may contribute to PD cognitive impairment by disrupting information transfer across interhemispheric and callosal-cortical projections.",

      "text": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) leads to substantial disability, but its neuroanatomic substrates are incompletely understood. 1,2 Gray matter atrophy, especially involving cortico-limbic regions, has been identified on brain MRI in patients with PD with dementia (PDD) and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). 3456 Microstructural white matter alterations in cortical, subcortical-cortical, cingular, and callosal pathways have been reported in PD cognitive impairment using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), though the presence and location of DTI abnormalities vary across studies. 7891011121314 DTI is an MRI technique that can be used to characterize directional properties of the diffusion of water in different tissues, such as brain white matter. Four commonly evaluated DTI scalar values include fractional anisotropy (FA) (a normalized SD of the eigenvalues), mean diffusivity (MD) (a directionally averaged measure), axial diffusivity (AD) (apparent diffusivity in the direction parallel to the underlying tissue tract), and radial diffusivity (RD) (apparent diffusivity perpendicular to the underlying tissue tract). 15 The corpus callosum is a critical structure for interhemispheric information transfer and thereby plays an important role in cognitive function. 16 In a prior study, we found macrostructural differences in the corpus callosum associated with PD cognitive impairment with greater volume loss in PDD compared to PD-MCI and cognitively normal (PD-NC) participants. 17 Furthermore, regional callosal atrophy predicted performance in certain cognitive domains. Building on this work, we sought to examine the microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum across the PD cognitive spectrum, using a region of interest approach based on the topographic patterns of callosal-cortical projections. 18 We investigated 4 DTI scalar values (FA, MD, AD, and RD) in the 5 topographically defined callosal segments in PD-NC, PD-MCI, and PDD participants compared to healthy controls (HCs) and evaluated their relationships to performance measures of different cognitive domains.",

      "text": "Participants underwent MRI brain scans at Rush University Medical Center using a 1.5T General Electric (Fairfield, CT) Signa scanner including DTI and T1-weighted sequences. T1weighted fast spoiled gradient echo sequence or magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequences were obtained with previously described parameters. 17 DTI sequences included diffusion-weighted, single shot, echoplanar imaging with the following parameters: 38 slices, repetition time 12,100 ms, echo time 97 ms, field of view 25 cm, matrix 128  128, slice thickness 3 mm, zero gap. DTI sequences were acquired with 6 repetitions in the anteriorposterior commissural plane and using 2 degrees of diffusion weighting (b values  0 smm 2 and 800 smm 2 ). Diffusion weights were applied in 26 noncollinear directions with 2 repetitions of b  0 and 2 repetitions of each diffusionweighted image. Raw diffusion-weighted images were aligned to the corresponding nonweighted image (B0) and corrected for eddy currents and motion artifacts using the FSL software package (fmrib.ox.ac.ukfsl). 28 A diffusion tensor model was fit for each diffusion-weighted image. FA, MD, AD, and RD values were obtained from each DTI image with FSL. Using FMRIBs nonlinear image registration tool (FNIRT) 29 within FSL, all FA, MD, AD, and RD images were nonlinearly registered to the mean FA template derived from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Human Brain Atlas, a highquality standardized atlas in 256  256  256 space. 30 Masks for region of interest (ROI)-based analyses were created from the IIT Human Brain Atlas. The principal diffusion direction volume was derived from the IIT Human Brain Atlas mean tensor volume using the DTI-TK software package (dti-tk.sourceforge.net). ROI masks were drawn overlying the principal diffusion direction volume using ITK-SNAP (itksnap.org). The corpus callosum was identified on a midsagittal plane, single slice based on the principal direction of diffusion. Only voxels with a transverse principal direction of diffusion were included in the mask in order to minimize inclusion of noncallosal regions within the ROI.\nFive segments of the corpus callosum (figure 1) were established according to the callosal-cortical topographical parcellation scheme of Hofer and Frahm, 18 which was used because of its derivation of callosal boundaries from human studies. In this parcellation scheme, the cortical projections of the 5 segments as delineated by Hofer and Frahm 18 using DTI-based tractography are as follows: segment 1 (most anterior), prefrontal cortex; segment 2, premotor and supplementary motor cortex; segment 3, motor cortex; segment 4, sensory cortex; segment 5 (most posterior), parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Because boundaries of the callosal segments as outlined by Hofer and Frahm are defined only at the midsagittal plane, we focused our analyses to this region. Separate ROI masks were drawn as follows: (1) the inferior axis of the corpus callosum was established by drawing a line at the corpus callosum base connecting the most anterior-inferior and posterior-inferior callosal points; (2) lines orthogonal to the inferior axis were established to divide the corpus callosum into 5 segments defined by Hofer and Frahm; and (3) separate ROI masks were established for each of the 5 segments (figure 1). A visual inspection of ROI masks overlaid against normalized FA, MD, AD, and RD images for each scan was performed blinded to diagnosis and confirmed good fit within the corpus callosum for all scans. Mean FA, MD, AD, and RD values for each callosal segment were calculated using FSL for each participant.",

    "Discussion": {
      "text": "Our study revealed increased measures of diffusivity, particularly in the anterior callosal segments, with (1) greater AD values in PD compared to HC and (2) increased AD, MD, and RD in the most cognitively impaired PD group (i.e., PDD), compared to PD-NC and to PD-MCI participants, but (3) no differences in DTI scalar values in those PD with normal cognition compared to HC. These findings suggest that there are abnormalities in the callosal white matter that may be specifically linked to the presence of cognitive impairment in PD. Furthermore, we found significant associations between DTI measures and performance in the different cognitive domains in PD. Our findings uphold classic brain-behavior relationships including the anterior-posterior dissociations that are particularly relevant in understanding cognitive deficits in PD. 31,32 These are supported by our findings of a predominance of anteriorly located DTI abnormalities associated with deficits in attentionworking memory and executive function cognitive domains and of posteriorly located DTI abnormalities with memory, visuospatial, and executive function cognitive domains.\nIncreased AD within the corpus callosum has been demonstrated in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, 33 Huntington disease (HD), 34 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 35 and in areas of white matter atrophy in HD 34 and Friedreich ataxia. 36 In patients with PD, areas of increased AD have been demonstrated in the substantia nigra 37 and right hemispheric frontal white matter projections in patients with PD with cognitive impairment. 38 One longitudinal study showed a faster rate of increase in AD metrics in several brain regions in PD compared to HC. 39 On the other hand, areas of reduced AD were noted in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum in a smaller cohort (n  22) of participants with PD in a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) 40 study specifically excluding participants with PD with notable cognitive impairment. 41 Reduced AD also has been associated with white matter axonal injury in animal models, 15,42 but the biophysical substrates underlying these alterations remain unresolved as other human disease studies report both increases and decreases. 34,36 Some studies suggest that atrophy may lead to increased extra-axonal space and smaller axonal caliber, potentially mediating greater water diffusion parallel to axons, resulting in increased AD. 34,36 Of interest, the callosal regions revealing increased AD in the current study overlap with the callosal areas in which we previously found macrostructural alterations, with participants with PD demonstrating volume loss in the anterior 2 5th-35th of the corpus callosum. 17 Callosal atrophy may contribute to altered AD, though actual microstructural tissue pathology cannot be inferred from imaging differences alone. 43 Among the PD cognitive groups, we found not only increased AD, but also increased values in other diffusivity measures (i.e., RD, MD) in the anterior corpus callosum as well as in relation to the severity of PD cognitive impairment. Increased diffusivity occurred to a greater extent in those with PDD compared to those with PD-NC in the anterior half of the corpus callosum, but also in those with PDD compared to those with PD-MCI in the anterior 16th of the corpus callosum. These DTI differences potentially may reflect abnormalities in myelination. For example, demyelination increased RD in a mouse model, potentially indicating less restricted water movement in directions perpendicular to underlying fiber tracts with myelin sheath breakdown. 44 However, RD may also be affected by axonal loss 43 or differences in axonal packing density or diameter. 45 MD is considered to be inversely related to membrane density and sensitive to cellularity, edema, or necrosis. 15 Thin, unmyelinated axons appear to be selectively vulnerable to developing abnormal proteinaceous aggregations characteristic of PD 46 and interestingly, the anterior corpus callosum has the highest concentration of small, unmyelinated axons in the structure. 47 The anterior-predominant DTI differences occurring in PD may potentially reflect this preferential distribution of thin, unmyelinated axons in the corpus callosum.\nWe found relationships between DTI scalar values and cognitive domain performance in several callosal segments in participants with PD. Moreover, these relationships support proposed brain-behavior hypotheses of anterior-posterior dissociations and PD cognitive dysfunction. 31 The most anterior callosal region (segment 1) demonstrated the strongest association with DTI values and cognitive domains: AD, RD, and MD values in this region were associated with all 5 cognitive domain scores, while FA values in segment 1 were associated with attentionworking memory, executive function, and language performance. Given anterior callosal-prefrontal cortical connections, these alterations in microstructural integrity may affect information transfer to prefrontal regions and thereby play a role in the frontalstriatal cognitive deficits of PD. In addition, we found significant associations between FA values in the posterior callosal region (segment 5) and memory and visuospatial cognitive domains. Given connections of this most posterior callosal region to temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices, altered FA in callosal segment 5 may contribute to the posterior cortical type deficits recognized in PD cognitive impairment. The finding of significant relationships among DTI scalar values and cognitive domains in callosal areas in which groupwise differences were not detected highlights the multifaceted and complex nature of these relationships and need for studies with larger sample sizes of cognitive groups.\nWhile DTI studies that include the corpus callosum have been conducted, our study differs in several methodologic aspects from others reported in the literature. One notable difference is our use of a topographically defined parcellation scheme and ROI-based approach to focus solely on the corpus callosum, examining callosal segments and their neuroanatomically defined projections. 18 Other prior PD studies have documented DTI abnormalities in the corpus callosum amidst other white matter regions using whole brain TBSS approaches, and many have examined FA or MD only, 78910 though others included evaluations of AD and RD. 38,41 Additionally examining AD and RD helps expand our understanding of diffusion tensor models including comparisons of the role of diffusivity rates in different directions (MD, AD, RD) vs the directional preference of diffusion (FA). One study examined FA, MD, AD, and RD in the corpus callosum in a parkinsonian cohort (n  18), but the study was small, with mixed parkinsonian diagnoses, and did not evaluate cognitive status. 13 Some studies have identified significant differences in FA and MD between PD-MCI and PD-NC participants, but we did not. 7,8,10,11 We did find lower average FA and higher average MD values (nonsignificant) in PD-MCI compared to PD-NC participants in all callosal segments, but significant increases in MD were seen only in the most cognitively impaired participants with PD (PDD) in the anterior callosal segments. Methodologic differences such as our focus on the corpus callosum and its segments rather than all white matter tracts, an ROI approach rather than whole brain assessment, application of different definitions of PD cognitive impairment, and differing participant selection may explain different study results. Our finding of increased AD in the corpus callosum in participants with PD, in distinction from the finding of decreased callosal AD values of Georgiopoulos et al., 41 may reflect both differences in methodology and cognitive status of the PD cohorts, as the latter study specifically excluded patients with PD with MMSE scores 25. Our finding of no difference in DTI scalar values between PD-NC and HC further suggests that the differences in DTI scalar values seen in our study are specific for cognitive impairment in the context of PD, as these differences were notably most pronounced in the PD group with greatest cognitive impairment even when controlling for potential confounding variables such as age and disease duration.\nStrengths of our study include a large cohort of patients with PD diagnosed by movement disorders experts, representing a breadth of cognitive abilities, and established using welldefined cognitive criteria. Evaluation of the corpus callosum in the midsagittal plane offers the advantage of being one of the few areas in the brain with less concern regarding effects of crossing or divergent white matter fibers on DTI measures, given a relatively homogeneous and uniformly aligned population of white matter fibers. 15 We also utilized an ROI-based imaging evaluation, which can offer greater regional specificity. In this method, we specifically constructed ROI masks based on the principal diffusion direction and included only areas with clear left-right orientation of underlying fibers so as to minimize the effects of partial volume averaging, particularly at borders of tissue types. We acknowledge potential study limitations such that the midsagittal plane provides one view of the corpus callosum, and findings may differ in callosal areas outside this most midline, central part. Currently, these neuroimaging analyses represent research tools, though they may gain greater clinical application in the future. Future histopathologic studies of the corpus callosum may help elucidate the underlying microstructural nature of the neuroimaging DTI differences, and tractography imaging analyses may offer insights regarding callosal-cortical connectivity. Another critical evaluation for future studies is how abnormalities in the corpus callosum fit into the broader context of white matter alterations in PD cognitive impairment, including whether its changes occur relatively earlier or later compared to alterations in other white matter structures and whether the corpus callosum is preferentially affected. Longitudinal studies tracking DTI changes in the corpus callosum over time in the same individuals will allow greater understanding of the role of white matter microstructure in PD cognitive impairment.",

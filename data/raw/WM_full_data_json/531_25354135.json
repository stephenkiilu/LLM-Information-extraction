    "abstract": "Working memory impairment is among the earliest signs of cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We aimed to study the functional and structural substrate of working memory impairment in early AD dementia and MCI. METHODS We studied a group of 12 MCI and AD subjects compared to 12 age-and gender-matched healthy elderly controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a 2-back versus 1-back letter recognition task. We performed a three-way image fusion analysis with joint independent component analysis of cortical activation during working memory, and DTI derived measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mode of anisotropy. RESULTS We found significant hypoactivation in posterior brain areas and relative hyperactivation in anterior brain areas during working memory in ADMCI subjects compared to controls. Corresponding independent components from DTI data revealed reduced FA and reduced mode of anisotropy in intracortical projecting fiber tracts with posterior predominance and increased FA and increased mode along the corticospinal tract in ADMCI compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that impairments of structural fiber tract integrity accompany breakdown of posterior and relatively preserved anterior cortical activation during working memory performance in MCIAD subjects.",

    "Introduction": {
      "text": "Impaired working memory performance is among the earliest signs of incipient dementia in Alzheimers disease (AD) 1 and of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 2 a clinical at risk stage of AD dementia. 3 Functional imaging studies using fMRI have revealed altered network activation underlying working memory impairment in amnestic MCI and incipient AD dementia. 456 Using multimodal imaging one can investigate whether functional network alterations are related to changes in structural connectivity. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool to assess structural connectivity in vivo 7 and has previously been combined with fMRI to reveal common pattern of structural and functional disconnection in healthy aging and neuropsychiatric diseases. 8910 The simplest approach to combine fMRI and DTI data is to compare results from univariate analysis of each single modality. This provides, however, no information on the mutual correlations between changes in both modalities. Whole brain analysis using univariate regression between modalities is a further interesting approach, using imaging data as independent variables in a general linear model, 11 but this voxel-wise multimodal approach implicits different design matrices for each voxel and can therefore lead to nonestimable contrasts in a subset of voxels. Another approach is to track fibers between seed regions that have previously been identified from activation fMRI data. 12 It is, however, difficult to reliably track small fiber tracts; it often requires the definition of tracking way points introducing bias from prior anatomical assumptions. Other approaches use region of interest based analysis of anisotropy indices as mediators of cortical connectivity. These analyses are restricted to selected regions of interest in the functional and structural data. A purely data driven approach that covers the entire brain white matter and grey matter is offered by independent component analysis (ICA) to reveal the hidden sources of a given signal. 13 As an extension, joint ICA (jICA) can determine corresponding features of data across modalities based on a common mixing matrix. 14 In the context of structural connectivity analysis in AD, the most widely used scalar marker of diffusion anisotropy and fiber tract integrity is fractional anisotropy (FA). 15 Consistently, widespread decline of FA in intracortical projecting fiber tracts has been reported in mild AD and MCI. 161718 However, FA increases have been reported as well. 19,20 As an additional scalar marker of diffusion, the mode of anisotropy can help to determine whether an increase of FA is related to the loss of crossing fibers. 19,20 The mode indicates the type of diffusion, ranging from planar to linear.\nHere, we studied the fMRI BOLD signal during a working memory task and white matter microstructure in a group of 12 AD and MCI subjects and 12 healthy age-and gendermatched control subjects. We used jICA across three modalities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (i) fMRI activation during the working memory task, and (ii) FA and (iii) mode of anisotropy, to reveal the structural basis of altered cortical activation during working memory performance in mild AD and MCI. We hypothesized that differences of cortical activation in the grey matter in ADMCI subjects would be associated with differences in FA and mode in corresponding subcortical fiber tracts.",

      "text": "We examined 2 patients with the clinical diagnosis of clinically probable AD with mild dementia, and 10 subjects with the clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI and clinically possible AD. For subsequent analysis, these subjects were combined into one ADMCI group. For comparison, we investigated 12 cognitively healthy elderly subjects. Subjects characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Groups were matched for age, gender, and education.\nThe mini-mental-state examination (MMSE) was used to assess the overall level of cognitive impairment. 21 Clinically probable AD was diagnosed according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. 22 Amnestic MCI was diagnosed according to Mayo Clinic criteria 23 with subjects showing subjective memory impairment, scoring more than 1.5 standard deviations below the age-and education-adjusted mean in tests of immediate and delayed verbal and nonverbal memory, having unimpaired general cognition and activities of daily living and receiving a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of .5. 24 Healthy volunteers were recruited though newspaper articles or as spouses of our patients. They had no subjective memory complaints, and normal scores in all subtests of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) cognitive battery, 25 trail making test part A and B, 26 and clock drawing test. 27 All healthy control subjects scored 0 in the CDR rating. 24 The clinical assessment included detailed medical history, clinical, psychiatric, neurological and neuropsychological examinations (CERAD battery, 25 clockdrawing-test, 27 trail-making test), 26 and laboratory tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver-associated enzymes, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein HDL, triglycerides, serum B12, folate, thyroid function tests, coagulation, and serum iron). Furthermore we examined the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype of all subjects. APOE genotyping was carried out at the Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Rostock using established procedures. 28 In the ADMCI group, four subjects carried at least one ApoE4 allele, in the control group one subject carried one ApoE4 allele (not significantly different between groups, Fishers exact test, P  .32).\nOnly subjects were included which were able to perform the experimental working memory task with higher memory load (2-back task, see below for details) in a prior instruction and test session. The study has been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and its 59th amendment (Seoul, 2008). The study had been approved by the institutional review board of the Medical Faculty of the University of Rostock. Written informed consent was obtained in every subject before examination.",

We had already used this task in an earlier study in personality disorder, 30 but we adapted the task to the lower cognitive capabilities of the ADMCI sample. Participants were asked to monitor a series of letters and to press a button whenever a letter was identical to the letter presented one (1-back) or two trials before (2-back). The working memory task was presented in two runs. In the first run, four blocks of 1-back trials were presented and in the second run four blocks of 2-back trials were presented. Each block lasted 30 s and contained 12 letters with three targets and nine distractors. Targets and distractors were placed randomly at the 12 possible positions.\nAdditionally, neutral and negative emotionally salient pictures were presented in the background of the working memory task, as part of a project on the interaction between emotion and cognition. 31 In two blocks each of the 1-back and 2-back condition the neutral and in the other two blocks the emotionally salient pictures were presented. The pictures were selected from the International Affective Picture System. 32 Participants were instructed to ignore these stimuli and to focus on the working memory task.\nEach picture was presented after each other with no gap for the whole trial length of 2,500 milliseconds. In the middle of the picture, a gray box was placed with a size of 120 pixel  100 pixel. The letters were presented inside these boxes, from 1 s until 2 s after trial onset.\nFor the present analysis, we were not interested in the interaction of working memory performance and emotional salience of stimuli and therefore selected only the contrasts of the 2-back versus 1-back letter condition with neutral pictures in the background.",

The skull was stripped using Brain Extraction Tool and the diffusion tensors were fitted to the data with DTIfit (FMRIB Image Analysis Group, Oxford, UK). We determined FA and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy specifies the type of anisotropy as a continuous measure reflecting differences in shape of the diffusion tensor. 36 It varies between -1 and 1, ranging from planar (in regions with crossing fibers of similar density) to linear (in regions where one fiber population orientation predominates). The mode is usefully employed to interpret changes in FA. For example, an increase of mode in a given region, indicating a more linear diffusion, would suggest that an increase of FA in the same region reflects selective loss of one fiber population amongst crossing fibers.\nFA and mode maps were affinely coregistered with the corresponding structural image. The fluid deformation fields for the DARTEL normalization of structural images into MNI standard space (see above) were combined with the affine coregistration matrix from DTI to structural MRI space. The FA and mode maps were transformed to MNI space without modulation. We used a binary mask to exclude voxels outside of the white matter based on the average of the structural white matter segments across all subjects and smoothed the normalized masked FA and mode maps using a Gaussian kernel with 8 mm FWHM.",

      "text": "To determine the association between functional connectivity during working memory performance and white matter microstructure without a priori selection of correlated regions, we applied the approach of jICA. 10,14,39 ICA assumes that a given data distribution results from the linear mixing of a set of unknown sources of signal that can be estimated when the hidden signal sources are statistically independent and arise from some non-Gaussian distribution. jICA determines the hidden sources of a joint data distribution from different imaging modalities to uncover spatial pattern that are linked across modalities. Threeway fusion of imaging data was performed using the jICA implemented in the Fusion ICA toolbox (JICAT v2.0 c) running under Matlab 7.13 (available at http:icatb.sourceforge.net). 14 Contrast images of the fMRI data for each subject were used, based on the 2-back minus 1-back letter recognition with emotionally neutral pictures. Spatially normalized and white matter masked FA and mode maps were used for the DTI data. FMRI and DTI data were sampled to have a common voxel size (1.5 mm 3 ) and normalized to have the same average sum of squares (computed across all subjects and all voxels for each modality). The normalization step accounted for different ranges in signal intensities between fMRI and DTI data by preserving the scaling within modality, but normalizing units between modalities. FMRI and DTI data were combined in one data matrix that was subjected to ICA. A previous ICA analysis of only the fMRI data had converged at five components. Therefore, the algorithm was instructed to search for 5 components. Group comparisons between the 5 components were considered significant at a Bonferroni corrected level of .055  .01. Group differences in the strength of network representation were determined using the mixing coefficients, as described in Ref. 40.",

The jICA fMRI source implicated hypoactivation of cortical BOLD signal in cerebellum and posterior cortical areas, including posterior cingulate, precuneus, and cuneus, as well as lateral temporal lobes, in ADMCI compared to controls, and relative hyperactivation in prefrontal lobe areas and caudate. The jICA FA source identified reduced FA in uncinate fasciculus, cingulate, corpus callosum, and inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus in ADMCI subjects compared to controls. Decline of FA in these areas was accompanied by decline of mode in the overlapping areas in the jICA mode component.

Previous studies reported heterogeneous findings on differences in working memory networks between MCI subjects and controls. In early MCI, stronger activations have been reported in prefrontal and parietal lobes compared to controls in a working memory paradigm, 4 whereas in advanced MCI activations were reduced in posterior brain areas, with compensatory activations in prefrontal lobes. 5,6 Our subjects rather represent an advanced stage of MCI with two of the subjects already in the mild dementia stage of AD.

FA was reduced in ADMCI subjects compared to controls predominantly in corpus callosum fibers (forceps major), anterior thalamic radiation, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, uncus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. The areas of FA reduction were characterized by a decrease of mode in the associated jICA mode component. The spatial pattern of FA reduction agrees with findings in previous studies using univariate analysis. 17,41,42 In contrast, FA values were increased in ADMCI relative to controls predominantly in the corticospinal tract and in anterior thalamic radiation. This finding agrees with results from an independent sample demonstrating an increase of FA in corticospinal tract areas in mild AD subjects, 18 and with a recent study in a sample of 138 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects, and 153 healthy controls, showing a parallel increase of FA and mode in cortico-petal and cortico-fugal fiber tracts. 20 The parallel increase of mode in the corticopsinal tract represented in the jICA mode component suggests that the increase of FA reflects a loss of crossing fibers along these tracts. 19,20 This agrees with neuropathological evidence for a relative sparing of motor cortex and pyramidal tract in AD 43 and the clinical observation that motor function is relatively preserved until advanced stages of disease.",

    "Association of Structural and Functional Connectivity Changes": {
      "text": "The jICA analysis results suggest that the breakdown of posterior brain activation and relatively preserved anterior brain activation during working memory performance in ADMCI subjects was associated with specific alterations of fiber tract integrity. Reductions of FA and mode between groups were predominant in posterior white matter areas. In addition, reductions were detectable in the anterior thalamic radiation and anterior corpus callosum (forceps minor). Posterior corpus callosum connects superior parietal, posterior temporal, and occipital cortical areas, 44 including key nodes of working memory activation. The superior longitudinal fasciculus forms a large arc superior and lateral to the putamen connecting all four cerebral lobes, its integrity has been implicated in language processing in the human brain. 45,46 Its impairment has been well documented in MCI and mild AD 41,42 and might account for functional uncoupling of prefrontal and posterior brain areas during verbal working memory performance. An important role can also be assigned to the integrity of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus that maintains structural connectivity between frontal and temporal lobes and to the integrity of the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus that supports direct propagation of visual input to frontal cortex and direct top-down modulation of visual processing, respectively. 47 In addition to decrease of FA and Mode, in some areas we found increases of FA and Mode. The location of these effects was similar to that previously found in two independent samples of AD and MCI subjects. 19,20 In both previous studies, the relative increase of FA and Mode was attributed to loss of crossing fibers, involving among others the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Taken together, one may speculate that increase of FA in AD indicates relative preservation of cortico-petal and cortico-fugal fiber tracts, such as pyramidal tract, and loss of crossing fibers, such as superior longitudinal fasciculus, that in turn may be associated with a shift from posterior to more anterior activation during task performance in MCIAD. Studies with larger samples are needed to confirm this effect.\nWe found a significant association between reaction time differences for two-back versus 1-back task performance and the mixing coefficients for the group discriminative component, in-dicating that longer reaction times for working memory performance were associated with a pattern of reduced posterior and relatively increased anterior activation and connectivity. There was no significant association between sensitivity of working memory performance and activation pattern. These findings would agree with a preserved accuracy, but increased latency of response due to compensatory activation of less efficient, but partly preserved networks within the MCIAD sample. The small number of subjects renders this analysis preliminary. If confirmed in an independent sample, this effect would lend support to the notion that activation pattern are associated with specific changes in task performance.",

    "The Methodology of jICA": {
      "text": "Analysis of multimodal data gains increasing attention in neuropsychiatric research. Simultaneous changes in different imaging modalities between diagnostic groups reveal neurobiological correlates of disease and may offer additional diagnostic accuracy in preclinical stages of disease. Univariate approaches may be used to compare single modalities between groups and then heuristically compare effects between modalities. This approach, although widely used, is limited in reproducibility and poorly controlled in terms of statistical inference to be drawn from between modality differences and similarities. An expansion of univariate analysis to multimodal data has been proposed by voxelwise univariate regression between modalities. 11 Analyzing multimodal data in one regression model, however, is asymmetric, because a subset of imaging modalities is used to build regressors and another modality is fitted to this regressor model. Therefore, these approaches can be deluding, when trying to fit the dependent primary modality to secondary imaging features which are not represented in the primary modality at all. 48 Consequently, multivariate approaches based on ICA have become more widely explored. The basic concept of ICA to find the sources that are hidden in a complex signal is very close to the problem faced in the analysis of structural and functional imaging data. ICA has been extended to determine the common signal sources across modalities using jICA where one mixing matrix is determined from the joint signal of two or more modalities. 49 The general agreement of our main spatial findings from jICA with findings from previous univariate analyses supports the validity of this approach. A general advantage is that there is no need for multiple comparison correction. Multivariate approaches take advantage of the high degree of coherence between brain regions and modalities to reveal sources of the signal that covary across imaging modalities.",

    "Limitations": {
      "text": "Several limitations of our study need to be considered: First, the sample size is relatively small. The findings of our study are encouraging as to the power and validity of our approach. They warrant the conduction of future studies with larger sample size. Supporting our findings, in an independent large sample of AD patients, CSF positive MCI patients, and healthy controls we have found a similar pattern of reduced FA with reduced mode in intracortically projecting fiber tracts, and increased FA and increased mode in corticopetal and corticofugal fiber tracts. 20 Second, when analyzing different modalities, errors in spatial alignment of modalities can influence the results of ICA. In our study, we used affine alignment of the fMRI and DTI modality, respectively, within subjects to the anatomical MRI scans in native space and subsequent highly nonlinear alignment of anatomical MRI scans into standard space across subjects that was common to both modalities. Therefore, systematic differences in the accuracy of affine alignment of DTI and fMRI data to anatomical MRI data could drive effects in ICA analysis. During visual inspection, we did not find evidence for major systematic misalignment within subjects between DTI and fMRI modalities, but such an effect cannot entirely be excluded. An alternative would be to directly coregister DTI and fMRI data to each other within subjects; this would, however, limit the accuracy of the transformation of these modalities into a common standard space across subjects which can most exactly be achieved using high-resolution anatomical MRI data. A trade-off between more exact intrasubject alignment or more exact intersubject alignment would probably prefer more exact intersubject alignment (driven by high resolution anatomical data), as the intrasubject alignment is likely to be less prone to large errors due to the common underlying brain morphology across modalities. Third, the degree of association between functional and structural connectivity may vary across cognitive tasks. In a previous analysis using resting state fMRI and DTI data, we found an association between the degree of functional connectivity in the default mode network and FA reductions in fiber tract areas connecting key nodes of the default mode network in healthy elderly subjects. 8 In schizophrenia, associations between cortical response to auditory stimuli or a working memory task and changes in grey matter volumes and FA have been reported; 9,10,49 these findings support the applicability of this approach to different cognitive networks and disease conditions. Finally, sensitivity of 2-back versus 1-back recognition performance differed between ADMCI subjects and controls. Differences in performance levels could indicate differences in processing strategy or even the failure to perform any meaningful task when the subject is overwhelmed by task difficulty. Therefore, graded tasks have been developed to allow for adjustment of performance levels across diagnostic groups. 50 We do not believe, however, that overall differences in performance were introducing a bias into our analysis. First, differences between groups were modest with preserved reaction times and performance above chance level in all subjects. Additionally, in univariate analysis, the ADMCI subjects activated a similar brain network compared to controls, although at a reduced level of intensity and spatial extent. This indicates that ADMCI subjects performed the task with a similar if less successful strategy than the healthy controls.",

      "text": "In summary, we found reduced posterior cortical and relatively preserved anterior cortical activation in a working memory paradigm in ADMCI subjects compared to age-and gendermatched healthy controls that was associated with a decline of structural integrity in associated fiber tract areas. In addition, we demonstrated an increase of FA in MCIAD subjects in the corticospinal tract that was accompanied by increase of mode in the same area, suggesting an apparent increase of diffusion anisotropy due to the loss of crossing fibers. These findings illustrate the use of multimodal imaging together with multivariate analysis to reveal the underlying functional and structural disconnection for specific cognitive impairments in early stages of AD. Future studies will use this approach in larger samples to determine the added value of cross-modal analysis for diagnostic accuracy and determine the structural substrate of impairment in other key cognitive domains in AD.",

    "INTRODUCTION": {
      "text": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of intracortical projecting neuron populations 1, which led to the characterization of the disease as a neuronal disconnection syndrome 2. Several studies using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found regional reductions of grey matter density or cortical thickness in cortical association areas 3456 as in vivo surrogate measures of neuronal loss 7. More recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has opened a window into cerebral fiber tract connectivity in vivo 8.\nUsing DTI, several studies have shown decline of white matter microstructure in intracortical projecting fiber tracts in AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 9, a clinical at-risk stage of AD 10111213.\nThe majority of studies have used fractional anisotropy (FA) as a diffusion index for the integrity of white matter fiber tracts. A small number of studies have investigated the opposite effect, i.e., increases of FA in AD patients and MCI subjects compared to controls 14,15, and concordantly reported increases of FA in the corticospinal tract. One previous study employed an additional scalar diffusion marker, the mode of anisotropy (Mode) 16, to help interpret increases in FA 15. The Mode ranges between -1 and 1 as diffusion ranges from planar (in areas with crossing fiber populations) to linear (in areas with one predominant fiber direction). MCI subjects exhibited an increase of Mode in a circumscribed region in the centrum semiovale, indicating a transition from planar diffusion in the presence of crossing fibers to more linear diffusion with loss of crossing fibers 15. A limitation of this earlier univariate analysis was that FA increases were only considered in the region where Mode increases had been found. This restricted the analysis to confirm an effect on FA in a previously defined small subregion.\nHere, we introduce the use of a multivariate analysis approach based on joint independent component analysis (jICA) 17 to determine parallel changes of FA and Mode across the entire cerebral white matter. jICA has successfully been employed to study the underlying sources of complex multimodal imaging data in aging 18 and neuropsychiatric diseases 19,20. ICA detects independent signal sources of a complex signal 21. jICA extends ICA by using a common mixing matrix to uncover the signal sources of multimodal imaging data 17. We applied this approach to DTI data of the European DTI study in Dementia (EDSD) 22 using multicenter DTI data from 138 AD patients and 153 controls. In addition, we studied 37 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of biomarker positive MCI according to revised research criteria 23 based on the presence of at least one pathological biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a primary hypothesis, we wanted to test whether increases of FA in AD and MCI would be accompanied by increases of Mode in similar areas using jICA to uncover common pattern of covariance between the two imaging features. The findings of our study help to understand the pathological substrate of white matter changes in AD. Particularly, our data will help to determine whether loss of crossing fibers occurs along cortico-petal and cortico-fugal fiber tracts in predementia AD and AD dementia and to explain an apparent increase of FA in corresponding brain regions.",

Milano (Italy), Mainz (Germany), Munich (Germany), and Rostock (Germany), including two centers contributing data from two different MRI scanners. Data of one site representing one scanner were omitted from analysis due to prominent imaging artifacts. The remaining data were derived from 138 patients with clinically probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRCA criteria 25 and 143 healthy elderly control subjects (henceforth labeled control sample I).\nIn addition, we studied 37 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MCI recruited from three centers (Mainz, Milano, Rostock). All MCI subjects scored 0.5 in the clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) 26. Of these subjects, 17 fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of MCI due to AD with a high degree of certainty (n  17) according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association (NIA-AA) workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for AD 23 with increased total-tau (t-tau) and phospho-tau (p-tau) levels and decreased amyloid- (A) 42 levels in the CSF examination. The remaining 20 subjects showed either increased t-tau and increased p-tau and normal levels of A 42 or decreased A 42 and normal levels of t-tau and p-tau. These MCI subjects correspond to the category of MCI subjects fulfilling core clinical criteria of MCI according to the NIA-AA workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for AD 23. The temporal distance between MRI and CSF examinations was on average 37 (SD 90) days. MCI subjects with no pathological biomarker or with no CSF examination have not been included.\nAt one site, MCI subjects had been scanned on a different scanner than the AD patients and controls from sample I. Therefore, for this site, we selected an additional sample of 10 healthy control subjects that had been scanned on the same scanner as the MCI subjects. Together with matched controls from the other two sites, this sample constitutes the control sample II, consisting of 32 subjects. Altogether, 328 subjects (138 AD patients, 143  10 controls, and 37 MCI subjects) were investigated.\nAll participants were free of any significant neurological, psychiatric, or other medical condition (except for AD and MCI in patients), in particular cerebrovascular apoplexy, vascular dementia, depression, subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as substance abuse. Healthy controls were required to have no cognitive complaints and scored within one standard deviation of the age and education adjusted norm in all subtests of the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) cognitive battery 27. Subjects characteristics can be obtained from Table 1.\nTo illustrate the fiber tract anatomy of the peak cluster of increased FA, we used diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) data from a 76-year old cognitively healthy woman that was not part of the previously described sample.\nWritten informed consent was provided by all subjects, or their representatives. The study was approved by local ethics committees at each of the participating centers, and has been conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.",

We first applied corrections for eddy currents and head motion. The skull was stripped using Brain Extraction Tool and the diffusion tensors were fitted to the data with DTIfit. FA and Mode maps were computed subsequently, using the standard FSL protocol.\nFor spatial normalization, anatomical MRI data as well as the FA-and Mode-maps were pre-processed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK, http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.ukspm) implemented in Matlab 7 (Mathworks, Natwick). In a first step, anatomical scans, FA-maps, and Mode-maps were manually aligned to place the anterior commissure at the origin of the three-dimensional Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate system. FA-maps and Mode-maps were rigidly aligned to the corresponding anatomical scans. Next, the VBM8 toolbox (Version 414, http:dbm.neuro.unijena.devbm8) 31 implemented in SPM8 was used to create a customized DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra) 32 template based on the anatomical scans. To avoid a potential registration bias in favor of particular scanners, we used a random subsample of 54 images, with the restriction to include scans from exactly 3 AD patients and 3 healthy controls from each of the 9 scanners. The template was used for high-dimensional DARTEL normalization of the anatomical scans as implemented in VBM8. The images were segmented into grey matter and white matter and transformed to MNI space applying modulation for non-linear components only. Deformation fields were derived which were applied to the spatially coregistered FA-maps and Mode-maps, without applying modulation.\nWe used a binary mask based on an averaged white matter image derived from the random sample of 54 normalized images to exclude all voxels outside the white matter of the FA-maps and Mode-maps. The normalized masked FA-maps and Mode-maps were smoothed using an 8 mm full width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel.",

The clusters in DSI native space served as seed regions for subsequent fiber tractography. Fiber tractography was conducted using DSI-Studio (available at http:dsi-studio.labsolver.org). We used a generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) reconstruction of the orientation density function 33. GQI requires the selection of a diffusion sampling length ratio. Empirically, we selected a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.1 that yielded the most plausible fiber tracts. We used a streamline tracking algorithm; fiber tracts were reconstructed with an angle 60  and fiber length between 20 and 500 mm.",

    "Joint independent component analysis of multiparametric DTI data": {
      "text": "To determine the association between FA and Mode changes without a priori selection of regions, we applied the approach of jICA 17,34,35. ICA assumes that a given data distribution results from the linear mixing of a set of unknown signal sources that can be estimated when the hidden signal sources are statistically independent and arise from some non-Gaussian distribution. We employed jICA to determine the hidden sources of a joint data distribution from two different diffusion metrics when the mixing matrices of both data modalities are stacked together. This approach uncovers spatial pattern that are linked across modalities.\nPrior to jICA, the data were mean centered within scanners to reduce effects of between scanner variability. In a previous study we have shown that mean centering efficiently reduces variability of FA maps across scanners 36. We calculated a mean image for each scanner by averaging the voxel values across all subjects per scanner. The corresponding mean image was then subtracted from every scan: x  i,k  x i,kxi,s where x i,k is the original value of voxel i in scan k, xi,s is the mean value of voxel i across all scans from subjects scanned in scanner s.\nSubsequently, two-way fusion of spatially normalized, white matter masked and mean centered FA-maps and Mode-maps was performed using the jICA implemented in the Fusion ICA toolbox (JICAT v2.0c) running under Matlab 7.13 (available at http:icatb.sourceforge.net) 17. FA and Mode data were normalized to have the same average sum-ofsquares (computed across all subjects and all voxels for each modality). The normalization step accounted for different ranges in signal intensities between FA and Mode data by preserving the scaling within modality, but normalizing units between modalities. FA and Mode data were combined into one data matrix that was subjected to ICA. The algorithm was instructed to search for eight components in the AD and control sample I, and for five components in the MCI and control sample II analysis based on the available number of data sets. Mixing coefficients of resulting components were compared between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for scanner, age, education, and gender as well as the interaction of diagnosis by scanner.",

An increase of FA in AD patients compared to controls occurred in the corticospinal tract (Table 2). Similarly, Mode was decreased in AD patients compared to controls in posterior corpus callosum and anterior thalamic radiation, and increased in AD patients compared to controls in the corticospinal tract (Table 3). For component 4, clusters of decreased FA in AD patients compared to controls projected on anterior corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Increased FA in AD patients compared to controls occurred in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum (Table 4). Similarly, Mode was decreased in AD patients compared to controls predominantly in anterior corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus.

    "DISCUSSION": {
      "text": "We used multivariate jICA analysis to determine the common pattern of FA and Mode changes in a large group of AD patients and MCI subjects compared to healthy elderly controls. The AD patients showed a decrease of FA in anterior and posterior corpus callosum and large intrahemispherically projecting fiber tracts, including inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. FA increases in AD patients occurred predominantly in the corticospinal tract extending from the centrum semiovale through the midbrain to the brain stem. FA increases were accompanied by consistent increases of Mode in corresponding areas, supporting the notion that increases of FA in AD dementia most likely result from the loss of crossing fibers. FA decline in MCI subjects occurred in similar areas as in AD patients, but was spatially more restricted. Increase of FA was limited to inferior portions of the corticospinal tract, parallel to an increase of Mode in these areas, but Mode increases also extended into the superior corticospinal tract. These findings suggest early disconnection of intracortically projecting fiber tracts as well as loss of crossing fibers along relatively preserved cortico-petal and cortico-fugal fiber tracts in AD.\nDecline of fiber tract integrity as indicated by reduced FA in intracortically projecting fiber tracts has been reported in a large range of previous studies in AD and MCI using region of interest based analysis 10,12,13,39, univariate analysis of voxel-based or tract-based FA values 40414243 or principal component analysis 14. Our findings based on ICA in a relatively large multicenter sample agree with these previous results. Specifically, anterior and posterior corpus callosum, cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were involved. Effects of scanner were present in only one of the components, but not in the component 8 that showed the strongest between group differences in AD and component 1 that showed a group effect in MCI. This finding suggests that some of the variability induced by multicenter acquisition of DTI data is independent from between group differences, in agreement with our previous findings using a clinical and physical phantom study from the same scanners and scan parameters 24, as well as a robust multicenter support vector machine approach 36.\nBeyond FA reductions, our data support and extend previous evidence for an increase of FA in some brain areas in AD and MCI. Only few previous studies have explicitly analyzed increases of FA in AD or MCI. These studies found increases in motor associated brain areas, including the corticospinal tract 14,15. Consistent with the study by Douaud and colleagues 15, increase of FA was accompanied by increases of Mode in our AD and MCI subjects. The previous study had found a small area of Mode increases in the centrum semiovale, containing motor fibers. In MCI we found a large cluster of Mode increase along the corticospinal tract and a spatially limited effect of FA increase in a caudal subregion of this cluster. In contrast, in AD patients we found a parallel increase of both FA and Mode in a large cluster extending along the corticospinal tract and involving anterior thalamic radiation and cerebellum areas. The increase of Mode, accompanying an increase of FA, suggests a more linear shape of the diffusion tensor, suggesting the loss of crossing fiber populations in these areas. The spatially more restricted effects in the MCI sample suggests that loss of crossing fibers already begins in the MCI stage of AD leading to apparent increases of FA and Mode, with higher sensitivity of Mode than FA in these early stages.\nThe functional consequence of these increases in FA and Mode remains to be further elucidated. Although FA increases along the motor tract and increased motor cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation 44,45 have been described in AD, in a previous analysis in 19 AD patients we did not find a correlation between FA increases and increased motor cortical excitability as measured by the resting motor threshold 46. In a recent study on 30 healthy elderly subjects, resting state motor threshold was not correlated with FA within the pyramidal tract either 47. However, long-term potentiation like plasticity of motor cortex 48 was correlated with FA along the pyramidal tact 47. Future studies using sensitive measures of cortical plasticity will help to determine if the assumed loss of crossing fibers may have an effect on the viability of the preserved fiber tracts.\nOur study is one of only few studies using ICA on DTI data, and to our knowledge the only such study in AD. The advantage of multivariate methods, such as principal component analysis or ICA, above univariate methods is the testing of pattern of group differences across the entire brain without the need to correct for multiple comparisons at the voxellevel. This renders these techniques very powerful if applied to highly structured data such as structural or functional brain scans. Extending this approach, jICA determines underlying signal sources for multimodal data by assessing a common mixing matrix across multimodal imaging features 17. A rigorous statistical analysis of multimodal imaging data is not easily done using univariate analysis. The simplest approach is to analyze group differences separately for each modality and then compare resulting difference maps visually for spatial overlaps and differences. This approach does not allow for a direct statistical testing of effects between modalities. In an extension of this approach, one modality can serve as primary endpoint to restrict analysis of other modalities to those brain areas where the primary modality showed significant group differences. This is an asymmetric approach where one modality serves as guiding feature; it does not allow for the assessment of effects outside specific regions. Biological parametric mapping provides an extension of the univariate approach by modeling the effect of one modality on another modality at each voxel location 49. Again, this approach is asymmetrical as it requires selection of one modality that is regressed on another modality 50. In addition, this voxel-wise multimodal approach implies different design matrices for each voxel and can therefore lead to non-estimable contrasts in a subset of voxels.\nIn contrast to univariate approaches, jICA is symmetrical, i.e., it does not favor one modality over the other, and estimates a common pattern of covariance across the entire brain. jICA is, however, computationally more demanding than univariate analysis. It took us about 14 minutes to run one analysis on a virtualized Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 server with 32 GB RAM and four Intel Xeon CPU cores working at 2.27 GHz.\nSeveral limitations of our study have to be considered. First, the multicenter acquisition may have induced systematic effects into the analysis. We tried to minimize these effects by mean centering of data and controlling the group comparisons for scanner effects. Indeed, the main group discriminative components in both cohorts were independent of scanner effects, suggesting at least a partial dissociation between group and scanner effects. Secondly, the use of additional diffusion modalities such as radial diffusion and axial diffusion may provide additional information on the underlying substrate of FA decreases and increases in AD. The information provided by Mode is on the shape of the diffusion tensor 16, whereas the information provided from axial and radial diffusivity is on different contributions of the single eigenvectors to the compound FA measure. The link, however, of radial diffusivity to myelin content and axial diffusivity to axonal density has been challenged in the presence of crossing fibers 51, rendering analysis of these parameters little informative in the absence of information on the shape of diffusion. Thirdly, MCI is known as a heterogeneous clinical concept. Therefore, to enrich the MCI sample for predementia AD, we used the presence of at least one pathological biomarker in CSF. Fourthly, matching of the AD group and control sample I for age failed by about three years, however, with widely overlapping age ranges. The difference of three years, although statistically significant in this large cohort, appears to be of limited clinical significance because results of group effects remained preserved before and after correcting the analyses for the effects of age. Consistently, when we repeated the analysis in a subsample that was matched for age, gender, and the number of subjects per diagnostic group per scanner, the results remained essentially unchanged. In addition, in a subsample matched for education, results were essentially unchanged as well, supporting the notion that the effects were independent from age, gender, education, and an imbalance in the number of subjects per diagnostic group across scanners. Finally, fiber tracking from identified clusters of FA increases within the study sample would have helped to verify the anatomical structures underlying these effects and to confirm a decrease of crossing fibers in these areas. However, the heterogeneous nature of the multicenter DTI data limits the use of fiber tracking methods 52. Therefore, we decided to use an independent set of DSI data 28 providing high resolution for crossing fibers 53 to illustrate the anatomy of fiber tracts in those clusters that showed a parallel increase of both FA and Mode. These clusters were symmetrically centered in the mid to posterior portion of the bilateral internal capsule and were traversed by pyramidal tract fibers in superior-inferior direction, commissural fibers from the corpus callosum truncus in mediallateral direction, and intrahemispherically projecting fibers, belonging among others to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, in anterior-posterior direction. Two of these fiber tract populations, i.e., the inter-and intrahemispherically projecting fiber tracts, are known to be prone to early degeneration in AD, whereas the corticospinal tract fibers are known to be relatively preserved in AD. Thus, the underlying fiber tract anatomy of the main clusters of FA and Mode increase supports the notion that an increase of FA in AD represents the relative preservation of corticospinal tract fibers in the context of degenerating inter-and intrahemispherically connecting fiber tracts.\nIn summary, we found a decrease of FA and Mode in intracortical projecting fiber tracts in AD and MCI compared to healthy elderly controls, and a parallel increase of FA and Mode primarily in the corticospinal tract in AD and MCI using multivariate analysis with jICA. Our data suggest that disconnection of intracortically projecting fiber tracts occurs already in predementia stages of AD. The picture becomes more complex as there are apparent increases of FA as a measure of fiber tract integrity in AD dementia and predementia AD. Our findings support the notion that these increases of FA result from the partial loss of specific fiber populations in crossing fiber areas. In particular, the principal cluster of increased FA in our AD sample may represent loss of commissural fibers from corpus callosum truncus and intrahemispherically projecting fiber tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus along relatively preserved corticospinal tract fibers. Our study provides a comprehensive overview on the pattern of cortical disconnection and loss of crossing fiber tracts along cortico-petal and corticofugal fiber tracts that may be useful for diagnostic studies of predementia AD and the investigation of the structural basis of functional disconnection in AD.",

Results indicate that some of the differences in MD and FA between prodromal AD subjects and cognitively healthy elderly were largely driven by unequal WMH load between the groups rather than disease-specific alterations NAWM).AD = Alzheimer's disease, CST = corticospinal tract, DC = dorsal cingulum, FA = fractional anisotropy, MD = mean diffusivity, NAWM = normal-appearing white matter, SLF = superior longitudinal fasciculus, VC = ventral cingulum, WMH = white matter hyperintensities.* denote p < 0.05n.s. denote non-significant.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}

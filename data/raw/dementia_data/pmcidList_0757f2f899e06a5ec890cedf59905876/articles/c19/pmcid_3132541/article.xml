Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two of the most common and devastating disorders that result in dementia in the elderly population. Although the definitive diagnosis of each type of dementia is not possible until autopsy, biomarkers based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), providing measurements of brain volume, perfusion, and white matter integrity, have been promising for improved diagnosis and prediction of dementia progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In AD, which is a progressive dementing disorder associated with cognitive impairments beginning with episodic memory deficits, MRI measurements of brain volume have shown characteristic gray matter (GM) loss primarily in medial temporal lobe regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] whereas functional studies using arterial spin labeling MRI or PET/SPECT imaging have shown prominent changes primarily in the parietal lobe (including the posterior cingulate gyrus and lateral temporoparietal areas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], though regions of structural, and functional alterations can overlap. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a unique method to assess the integrity of white matter microstructure, have revealed white matter (WM) alterations in AD, involving the parietal, temporal, and frontal brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In FTD, which is associated with impairments of social behaviors, personality, and executive functions, MRI has shown characteristic patterns of structural GM loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and GM dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] primarily in frontal and anterior temporal lobes. WM volume loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and WM degradation in FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have also been reported in the frontal and temporal regions.</p><p>Using biomarkers of neurocognitive measurements to differentiate between AD and FTD are often difficult because of overlapping symptoms. Several studies using imaging markers compared differences in abnormal brain patterns between AD and FTD directly. Structural MRI showed that AD was associated with greater GM loss than FTD in posterior brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] whereas FTD was associated with more severe GM loss than was AD in frontal brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Similarly, functional imaging such as PET/SPECT and perfusion MRI showed that AD was associated with greater reduced cerebral blood flow or metabolism than FTD in parietal and occipital brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; whereas FTD was associated with greater frontal dysfunction than AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition to differences in GM, we have previously reported differences in WM between AD and FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Specifically, measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA)—a summary measure of DTI indexing WM integrity—indicated greater WM degradation (FA reduction) of frontal brain regions in FTD compared to AD. Furthermore, no brain region in AD was shown to have more WM degradation when compared to FTD. Taken together, these findings suggest that AD and FTD are each associated with disease-specific regional patterns of GM and WM alterations. Recent multimodality strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] of combined radiological markers such as analyzing brain volume and perfusion or WM changes together have shown superior power than that using conventional single modality domain (e.g., brain volume measurement alone) in diagnosis of AD. However, to our knowledge, rarely did MRI studies evaluate GM and WM differences between AD and FTD jointly. </p><p>In this study we present a new approach to compare structural, perfusion, and diffusion alterations between AD and FTD using T1-weighted high-resolution structural MRI, arterial spin-labeled perfusion MRI (ASL-MRI), and DTI. The objective was to determine if a joint evaluation of multimodal MRI could provide a biomarker for a differential diagnosis between AD and FTD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Subjects and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>Twenty AD patients (mean age and standard deviation: 63.1 ± 6.9 yrs) with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] score of on average 21.9 ± 5.6, 20 patients with FTD (age: 60.7 ± 9.9 yrs; MMSE: 23.1 ± 5.6) and 21 cognitively normal (CN) subjects (age: 61.9 ± 9.6 yrs; MMSE: 29.6 ± 0.5) were included in this cross-sectional MRI study. A summary of the subject demographics and relevant clinical information are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The patients with FTD and AD were recruited from the Memory and Aging Center of the University of California, San Francisco. All patients were diagnosed based on information obtained from an extensive clinical history and physical examination. The MR images were used to rule out other major neuropathologies such as tumors, strokes, or inflammation but not to diagnose dementia. The subjects were included in the study if they were between 30–80 years old and without history of brain trauma, brain tumor, stroke, epilepsy, alcoholism, psychiatric illness, or other systemic diseases that affect brain function. FTD was diagnosed according to the consensus criteria established by Neary et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. All FTD patients were diagnosed with the frontal variant subtype, two of which had combined motor neuron-related symptoms. AD patients were diagnosed according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. All subjects received a standard battery of neuropsychological tests including assessment of global cognitive impairment using MMSE and global functional impairment using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Fifty-seven out of all 61subjects had blood drawn for APOE genotyping. Reliable information about the age of onset of symptoms was available from 12 out of 20 AD patients and from all 20 FTD patients. Because it is not unusual for subjects in this age group to have WM signal hyperintensities (WMSH) on MRI, subjects with WMSH were included. An experienced radiologist reviewed all MRI data, and the scores of WMSH were used as covariates in the analysis. The severity of WMSH was classified as mild (deep white matter lesions ≤3 mm, and periventricular hyperintensities &lt;5 mm thickness), moderate (deep white matter lesions between 4–10 mm, or periventricular hyperintensities between 6–10 mm thickness), or severe (deep white matter lesions &gt;10 mm, or periventricular hyperintensities &gt;10 mm thickness), according to the Scheltens' rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. All subjects or their legal guardians gave written informed consent before participating in the study, which was approved by the Committees of Human Research at the University of California and the VA Medical Center at San Francisco.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Data Acquisition</title><p>All scans were preformed on a 4 Tesla (Bruker/Siemens) MRI system with a single housing birdcage transmit and 8-channel receive coil. T1-weighted images were obtained using a 3D volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with TR/TE/TI = 2300/3/950 ms, 7-degree flip angle, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> resolution, 157 continuous sagittal slices. In addition, FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) images with timing TR/TE/TI = 5000/355/1900 ms were acquired to facilitate the evaluation of WMSH. Perfusion images were acquired using a continuous arterial spin labeling (cASL) sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] with a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) part to map the perfusion signal. cASL-MRI was performed with TR/TE = 5200/9 ms with 2-second long labeling pulses and a one-second postlabeling delay. Sixteen slices with 5 mm slice thickness and 1.2 mm interslice gap, 3.75 × 3.75 mm<sup>2</sup> in-plane resolution were acquired. DTI was acquired based on a dual spin-echo EPI sequence supplemented with two-fold parallel imaging acceleration (GRAPPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] to reduce susceptibility distortions. Other imaging parameters were TR/TE = 6000/77 ms, field of view 256 × 224 cm, 128 × 112 matrix size, yielding 2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup> in-plane resolution, 40 slices each 3 mm thick. One reference image (<italic>b</italic> = 0) and six diffusion-weighted images (<italic>b</italic> = 800 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, along 6 noncollinear directions) were acquired.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Data Analyses</title><p>The assessment of brain volume changes were performed using SPM8 software (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/</ext-link>) based on an “optimized” VBM procedure described by Ashburner and Friston [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The procedure included several steps. (1) Tissue segmentation: An expectation maximization segmentation (EMS) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] was applied to obtain probabilistic maps of GM, WM, and CSF from the T1-weighted MRI data. (2) Spatial normalization: first, customized GM and WM prior images were created by transforming GM and WM probabilistic maps of all subjects into the standard MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The segmented GM probabilistic maps in their native spaces were then spatially normalized again to the customized GM prior image using a nonlinear transformation with 16 interactions. (3) Jacobian modulation: the spatially normalized GM images were multiplied by the Jacobian determinants of the transformation (modulation) to obtain volume differences. (4) Smoothing: the modulated GM images were smoothed with an 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel to reduce variations from misregistrations and to perform voxelwise image statistics. </p><p>The assessment of perfusion changes included the following steps. (1) Cerebral blood flow (CBF) image calculation: a perfusion weighted (PWI) image was created by pairwise subtraction of coregistered labeled from unlabeled ASL images. The PWI images were then scaled to obtain a quantitative CBF image based on a single compartment perfusion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. (2) Intermodality coregistration: ALS perfusion and the corresponding T2- and T1-weighted image were coregistered using an affine alignment to establish anatomical correspondence between CBF and segmented GM images and to compute partial volume-corrected CBF in GM. (3) Partial volume correction: partial volume correction of CBF images was performed by rescaling CBF in each voxel proportionately to the GM and WM content, assuming that perfusion of white matter is only 25% of that of GM, as detailed by Du et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. (4) Spatial normalization: the partial volume-corrected CBF images in GM were spatially normalized to the customized GM prior image that was created from the previous processing of VBM, using the same nonlinear transformation and smoothing parameters.</p><p>The assessment of white matter integrity was performed based on DTI and computation of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, using the dTV.II software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and Volume-one software package (URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ut-radiology.umin.jp/people/masutani/dTV.htm">http://www.ut-radiology.umin.jp/people/masutani/dTV.htm</ext-link>), supplemented by automatic image denoising and eddy-current corrections. SPM8 software was used for voxelwise analysis of the FA images as outlined in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In brief, the FA images in the native space underwent the following procedures. (1) Creation of a customized FA template: an averaged FA image was first created from all subjects' FA images that initially transformed to the EPI-derived MNI template in SPM. This averaged FA image was further co-registered to the WM prior image using affine alignment and manual adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] to archive a customized FA template that accurately correspond to the anatomical information in the WM prior image. (2) Spatial normalization and smoothing: the FA image of each subject in the native space was recursively normalized to the customized FA template using the same nonlinear transformation and smoothing parameters that were applied in the previous VBM procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Statistics</title><p>Paired group differences were evaluated voxel-by-voxel using a general linear model with diagnosis as main contrast and age, sex, and the years of education as covariates. In addition, total intracranial volume (TIV) was used as a covariate in test for volume differences and global mean perfusion was used as a covariate in test for perfusion differences. A threshold of at least 85% GM volume fraction in voxels was applied to restrict GM volume and perfusion analyses to voxels containing predominantly GM. Similarly, a threshold of at least 80% WM volume fraction was applied to restrict FA analysis to voxels containing predominantly WM. The statistical significance for main effects of abnormalities, which was only the prestep for joint analyses, was set to an uncorrected voxel-level <italic>P</italic> value of  .001. </p><p>To test if FTD and AD differ with respect to WM and GM abnormalities, we started by determining the number of voxels representing “abnormal” values for each patient and each MRI modality. This was conducted by recording voxelwise differences between an individual's image value (GM volume, GM perfusion, or WM FA) and the respective mean value of the control group. The difference was then normalized to the standard error of the control mean value to express abnormality as a T-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. High T-scores represent high abnormalities beyond the normal ranges. Next, the number of “abnormal” voxels above a T-score threshold was recorded and normalized to the total number of GM or WM voxels to account for each patient and each modality to quantify the extent of brain abnormality. We termed the number of normalized “abnormal” voxels <italic>load</italic>. Differences in <italic>loads</italic> between AD and FTD patients were evaluated statistically via permutation test with 1000-fold completely random resampling of the diagnostic labels (AD and FTD), using the R project (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). The statistics on the <italic>loads</italic> were evaluated for T-score values ranging from −2 (indicating a mild abnormality level) to −6 (indicating a severe abnormality level). Using the permutation test, we also assessed whether the <italic>load </italic>from a specific MRI modality (e.g., WM FA) relative to another (e.g., GM loss) modality, termed conditional <italic>load</italic>, differed within and across the diagnosis groups. The level of significance for permutation tests was set at <italic>P</italic> = .05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3.

Compared to FTD, AD patients showed significant hypoperfusion in the left superior temporal gyrus, claustrum; whereas compared to AD, FTD patients had significant hypoperfusion in right superior, middle, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus. </p><p>Regarding WM FA, AD patients had FA reductions relative to CN bilaterally in WM regions in parietal, temporal, and some frontal lobe regions. The periventricular deep WM, posterior corpus callosum and the left posterior cingulum exhibited the most prominent FA reductions. In contrast, FTD patients had widespread FA reductions relative to CN bilaterally in frontal and temporal lobes, and the anterior corpus callosum, and bilateral anterior cingulum were prominently involved. Compared to AD, FTD patients had lower FA values bilaterally in frontal deep WM, anterior corpus callosum and bilateral anterior cingulum, whereas AD patients showed no region with significantly lower FA values when compared to the FTD group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.3"><title>3.3.

The extent to which differences in one <italic>load</italic> (on particular modality) relative to another (on reference modality) are above chance is depicted in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref> for AD and FTD, respectively.

Discussion</title><p>We have two main findings. First, FTD patients exhibited more WM damage than AD patients at mild abnormality levels (i.e., small T-scores). The difference vanished gradually for more severe abnormality levels (i.e., larger T-scores). Second, FTD patients had greater GM loss and WM damage relative to GM hypoperfusion, although the differences of damage between modalities gradually vanished with increasing levels of abnormality. In contrast to FTD, AD patients had equal damage in all three modalities, irrespective of the level of abnormality. Taken together, the results suggest that FTD and AD differ in amount of WM and GM structural and functional damages, in addition to their characteristic regional patterns of brain alterations than healthy controls.</p><p>Our first main finding of greater WM damage in FTD than AD at mild levels of abnormality suggests that WM may be more sensitive to the pathology of FTD than to the pathology of AD at their early disease stages. The hallmark of FTD is tauopathies or ubiquitin immunoreactive inclusions by the presences of neuronal and glial inclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] in gray and white matter. WM pathologies in FTD have been reported with astrocytic gliosis and oligodendroglial apoptosis, which may ultimately result in axonal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] also reported that oligodendroglial pathology can be predominant in FTD despite severe GM damage. On the other hand, degeneration of frontostriatal networks, which is a characteristic feature of FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], suggests that WM denegation in anterior brain could also be a primary FTD pathology. In contrast to FTD, the hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are associated with loss of neurons and synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. WM pathology in AD has been suggested to occur secondarily to GM pathology and may include reduction of myelin, axons, and oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. A vascular origin of WM pathology in AD has also been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, WM pathologies in AD are usually considered mild and potentially reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Interestingly, our data showed that differences in WM damage between AD and FTD disappeared at higher abnormality levels. It is possible to suggest that AD and FTD undergo similar WM pathologies at a severe brain damage level. One explanation is that severe WM abnormalities are an outcome of irreversible vascular damage, such as appearance of WMSH, which affects AD and FTD similarly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Another possible explanation is that WM changes resulting from degeneration of corticocortical connections may inevitably occur in both AD and FTD.</p><p>In addition, we found a trend of more GM loss in FTD than AD at moderate to severe levels of abnormality. This observation is consistent with histopathological studies showing substantial loss of spindle neurons in the cortex in FTD but not in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The finding is also in agreement with several MRI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] which compared FTD and AD directly, showing regionally greater GM loss in FTD when compared to AD but no greater GM loss in AD when compared to FTD. Similarly, several longitudinal studies reported greater rates of GM atrophy in FTD when compared to AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. However, some MRI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] reported greater GM loss in AD compared to FTD, though the extent of the GM losses varied regionally. The discrepancy may result from notorious difficulties to adequately match impairment severity in FTD and AD given substantial differences in symptomatology, although our current study attempted to match the severities (such as the measures of CDR, MMSE) of AD and FTD groups as closely as possible. </p><p>The second major finding that GM loss and WM damage exceed perfusion damage in FTD may be explained by loss of brain tissue other than neurons contributing to GM atrophy in FTD. Information about differential loss of various types of brain tissue may be particularly relevant in earlier and potentially reversible stages of the disease. Our findings are supported by several histopathological studies demonstrating that the earliest cellular changes in FTD occur in astrocytes without neuron loss and that neuronal damage becomes more prominent in later stages of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Therefore, at mild abnormality levels of FTD, the surviving neurons may still function normally as reflected by the normal levels of perfusion. Our findings are consistent with other studies carried out in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and on different cohorts of FTD and AD patients which have implied dissociation between GM atrophy and perfusion. Specifically, these studies indicated that FTD was associated with greater GM atrophy in absence of significant reduction of perfusion. These results contrast the findings in AD, where the abnormalities across the three modalities were all similar. </p><p>Our voxelwise analysis demonstrates the regional patterns of GM loss, hypoperfusion, and reduced WM FA in this sample of AD and FTD patients are consistent with the disease-specific patterns that have been reported in previous MRI studies of brain structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and DTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Furthermore, the similarity between the regional patterns of GM and WM alterations which appear in the same lobe together for each disease, implies that WM degradation mirrors that of GM damages and is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Taken together, these results can demonstrate the well-documented pathological bases of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].</p><p>The new joint analysis approach allows for the investigation of different abnormalities across multiple MRI modalities such as structural, perfusion and diffusion MRI between groups. The approach can be used to test whether groups differ with respect to a single MRI measure as well as multiple measures. The approach was augmented by nonparametric statistical tests via permutations and carried out across a range of T-scores to reduce measurement bias toward the various brain conditions. The concept can be expanded in principle to conduct a voxelwise joint analysis of multiple MRI measures to determine regional variations in GM loss and hypoperfusion. Other statistical methods for joint analyses of multiple image modalities such as joint independent component analysis (jICA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] may provide alternative solutions. The findings with multimodal MRI could potentially be useful to improve the design of AD and FTD clinical trials involving MRI. First, correlations across the MRI measures, potentially boosting sensitivity and specificity, could lead to reduced sample sizes. Second, the finding revealed that FTD presents more white matter involvement relative to AD, thus providing a new biological feature of FTD, and could be used to relax the need to match disease severity in studies recruiting AD and FTD patients.  </p><p>Limitations of the current study include a small sample size that was reliant on clinical diagnoses which were not sufficiently confirmed by autopsies. Therefore, confidence in the generalization of the results is limited, and potential misdiagnosis of patients may have resulted in spurious findings. Furthermore, we cannot completely rule out that other factors than disease etiology, such as genetic profiles, duration of symptoms, and cardiovascular conditions, which contributed to MRI differences between the patients and thus contaminated the findings. Second, diffusion encoding was limited to the minimum of 6 directions at the time this protocol was initiated, although it is known that many more encoding directions improve the characterization of diffusion such as fewer ambiguities in regions of crossing fibers and better spatial invariance of the noise pattern. Therefore, fiber crossings and the DTI noise pattern may potentially mimic regional differences in FA between these groups. Third, we ignored relationships between brain regions in our joint analysis and therefore under-utilized information from the multimodal MRI data. A more powerful statistical framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] that takes spatial relations between multivariate measures into account may provide more power. Finally, the data was artificially scaled to provide a uniform resolution for all MRI modalities, which may have induced a spatial bias as well as altered selectively the sensitivity of each modality. Other approaches that do not require a uniform resolution but can operate on variable spatial scales, such as information theoretic formalisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], may lead to differences in results. </p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that FTD and AD differ regarding their impacts on WM and GM structural and functional abnormalities, in addition to differences between their characteristic regional patterns of brain alterations. Furthermore, the joint assessment of multimodal MRI measures employed in this study has potential value to improve the differential diagnosis between FTD and AD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was funded in part by National Institutes of Health Grants (P01AG19724, P50 AG23501) and a Grant from the National Center for Resource Research (P41 RR23953).

The single-task trial consisted of walking the length of the mat at the participant's usual pace. For the dual-task trials, participants walked at their usual pace with no instruction to prioritize the gait or cognitive task; while doing the following cognitive tasks aloud – one at a time, (i) counting backwards from one hundred by ones (ii) subtracting serial sevens from one hundred, and (iii) naming animals out loud.

Then, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), a part of FSL was run as previously described (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). TBSS involves aligning data into 1 mm × 1 mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 Space and registering each patient's brain into the FMRIB58 template using the FMRIB's Nonlinear Image Registration Tool (FNIRT, part of FSL). Then a mean image of FA values (including pixels with values above 0.2 to eliminate voxels in the grey matter or cerebrospinal fluid from the analysis) was created and thinned to create a mean FA “skeleton” which represents the centers of all tracts within the subject group. Finally, each subject's aligned data was projected onto this skeleton; MD, AD and RD were processed in the same way. In addition, WM fiber tracts' DTI parameters averages were calculated for each tract ROI per patient to allow for further examination if necessary.

A Spearman's rank-order correlation was run to determine the relationship between predicted and actual number of falls, and found a strong, positive correlation which was statistically significant (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.641, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .0001).<table-wrap position="float" id="t0015" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Parameters estimates for negative binomial regression with multiple predictors.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0040">Table 3</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">Sig.</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">IRR</th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">95% Confidence Interval for IRR<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lower</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Upper</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">RD ForcepsMin (10<sup>7</sup> μm<sup>2</sup>/s)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>0.02</bold><xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">⁎</xref></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.02</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.00</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.04</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gender</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.24</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.74</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14.18</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.89</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.75</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.05</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Body Mass Index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.98</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.00</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.81</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.23</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Number of years of education (yrs)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.93</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.99</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.77</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.28</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">T0 MMSE</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>0.01</bold><xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">⁎</xref></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.91</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.15</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.17</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total number of comorbidities</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.65</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.94</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.73</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.22</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">counting gait velocity (m/s)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>0.02</bold><xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">⁎</xref></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.95</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.90</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">WMH (cm<sup>3</sup>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>0.03</bold><xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">⁎</xref></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.20</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.02</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.42</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0005"><label>⁎</label><p id="np0005">Significant at the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05 level (in bold); IRR: Incident Rate Ratios.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0155">Changes in tissue microstructure in WM were significantly associated with gait disturbances and falls in older adults with MCI, even after adjusting for WMH and other important covariates. Specifically, we found that several DTI parameters correlated with slow gait and previous falls in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, forceps minor and major, corticospinal tract, anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus. DTI can be used to probe the integrity of WM tissue microstructure. In this study, the analysis of DTI parameters FA, MD, AD and RD provided specific quantitative measures that were associated with gait performance and history of falls.</p><p id="p0160">Previous non-TBSS imaging studies focusing on MCI-related abnormalities found WM alterations in people with MCI in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes(<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Medina and Gaviria, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2006</xref>) as well as the posterior cingulum,(<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2009</xref>) splenium of corpus callosum,(<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2008</xref>) long association fascicles,(<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2009</xref>) and internal capsule.(<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2009</xref>) TBSS MCI studies found reduced WMI in the splenium of the corpus callosum, crus of fornix, (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2010</xref>) and para hippocampal WM, uncinate fasciculus, and WM tracts of the brain stem and cerebellum.(<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) Imaging studies focusing on gait related abnormalities found association between gait performance and WM hyperintensities(<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Rosano et al., 2006</xref>) and WMI in the genu of the corpus callosum and gait in the elderly (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bhadelia et al., 2009</xref>) as well as bilateral frontal and periventricular WM lesions-affected voxels corresponding to major anterior projection fibers (thalamic radiations, corticofugal motor tracts) and adjacent association fibers (corpus callosum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, short association fibers) (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a recent cross-sectional imaging study of normal adults at risk of falls found several clusters of abnormal WM regions that correlated with gait performance (medial frontal. Parietal subcortical pathways, genu and splenium of corpus callosum, posterior cingulum, prefrontal and orbitofrontal pathways, and longitudinal pathways that connect frontal-parietal-temporal lobes), with a smaller portion (medial frontal and parietal subcortical pathways) that also correlated with MMSE scores (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, one study that focused on finding the cross-sectional association between history of falls and the WMI of patients with Cirrhosis. <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Ansón et al. (2015)</xref> found significant deteriorations in local WMI within the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corticospinal tract associated with falls in agreement with our TBSS findings.</p><p id="p0165">When our sample was stratified based on history of falls, fallers were found to have significantly reduced WMI in the corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, and forceps minor. Using voxel-wise non-parametric permutation test of all four DTI parameters, limited loci within WM tracts were found to be significantly correlated with some gait parameters and falls. Our primary findings indicated that WMI, as measured by AD, RD, MD or FA, was lower in MCI patients with a history of falls, within several WM tracts including but not limited to the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the forceps minor and the uncinate fasciculus. Successful regression models using the RD of the forceps minor showed that poor WMI is significantly associated with history of falls in MCI. The model remained significant after accounting for age, sex, BMI, years of education, MMSE, comorbidities, dual-task gait velocity, and WMH.</p><p id="p0170">The executive network has been previously suggested to be involved with mobility function and falls (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso and Hachinski, 2014</xref>). Therefore, it was expected that lower WMI would be found in the forceps minor (a tract that connects the frontal and prefrontal lobes by passing though the genu of the corpus callosum) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (a tract that connects the occipital, posterior temporal, and the orbito-frontal areas associated with visuospatial function) WM regions in patients with history of falls since the executive network relies on the integrity of these tracts (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Genova et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the implied disruption in fronto-occipital fasciculus as determined by the reduced WMI (low FA and AD) might indicate disruption in the connectivity between different functional networks (e.g. executive function – in the prefrontal cortex and visual and proprioception in the occipital/parietal lobes). Further implicating the executive network in falls stems from the observation that significant WMI differences between fallers and non-fallers appear to be lateralized predominantly to the left hemisphere, consistent with previous evidence suggesting left-lateralized WM damage is responsible for executive function impairment (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Barbey et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, executive dysfunction has been associated with reduced dual-task gait velocity in healthy older adults (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Coppin et al., 2006</xref>) and MCI (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2009b</xref>).</p><p id="p0175">Clinically, our results highlight the relationship between gait, cognitive dysfunction, and fall risk in older adults with MCI as symptomatic flags to the presence of underlying pathology affecting WM structural connectivity between common brain regions. This may unravel the role of modifiable factors including vascular damage, in addition to the neurodegenerative process (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Holtzer et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, it was previously shown that older adults with MCI that had high prevalence of vascular risk factors were more likely to present slowing gait, greater dual-task cost on gait, and executive dysfunction (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hajjar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Odasso et al., 2012b</xref>). Our study provides further evidence that specific tracts are associated with gait characteristics and falls. These results are consistent with recent work evaluating normal older adults that also found a strong association between the forceps minor and gait performance (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Poole et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">Some limitations of our study should be considered. The cross-sectional design precludes a direct causal interpretation of the associations between differences in WMI and history of falls. Stratification of patients to the two groups assumed singular fall events were not incidental but related to underlying pathology, which may not be correct for all patients. Furthermore, history of falls was used in lieu of- and as a surrogate for- each patient's fall risk. An additional limitation was that WMH volume was not accounted for in the TBSS analysis, which could introduce variability due to the significantly different DTI parameters values within these lesions. However, the patient cohort studied presented with generally small WMHs, and WMH volume was used as a confounding variable in the regression to minimize potential bias. Several other confounding variables that may modify the association between WMI, falls and gait performance were controlled for; however, there may be other un-accounted confounders in this study. For example, it may be important in future studies to control for single-task gait characteristics or at least assess dual-task cost, when testing dual-task performances and associations with WMI, since it is possible baseline single-task performance introduce a bias into the dual-task analysis when not controlled for. A weakness of this study is the exploratory nature of the associations and consequently the relatively large number of statistical tests performed which increased the risk of a Type 1 error (false positives). No corrections were made for multiple comparisons to reduce the likelihood of missing important differences and reduce likelihood of Type 2 errors (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Perneger, 1998</xref>). Based on the results of the current study, prospective studies can be designed to focus on specific WM tracts, which would reduce these concerns. Finally, our study sample consisted exclusively of MCI older adults and thus results may not generalize well beyond this population. Future studies should explore if WMI can prospectively predict falls in older adults with MCI. Our study strengths include the comprehensive clinical, cognitive and mobility assessment in a very well identified cohort of individuals with MCI. In addition, we applied novel and emerging imaging tools and methodologies to study WMI and its role in mobility-cognitive dysfunction. DTI parameters were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), an automated exploratory approach to investigate the whole brain while circumventing the shortcomings of ROI and volume based morphometry techniques, and is therefore considered more sensitive and less prone to errors (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). For regression analysis our measurements of region-specific DTI parameters of the Forceps minor were made using standard brain atlas-derived regions of interest (ROIs) within the skeletonized DTI parametric maps. This further supported the interpretation that the Forceps minor WM tract is critically associated with falls. And finally, the group comparisons and regression models accounted for multiple confounders including age, sex, years of education, BMI, and MMSE scores.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0185">Quantitative measures of WMI using voxel-wise TBSS technique was found to be significantly associated with history of falls and poor gait performance in MCI. There was no significant white matter or grey matter macro-structural differences between the groups in this cohort. However, the integrity of WM microstructure in the tracts that are involved in executive and visuospatial functions were found to be preferentially affected in MCI individuals with history of falls and dual-task gait disturbances.</p><p id="p0190">Our findings support the notion that white matter integrity in key brain regions is affected in older adults with MCI and history of falls and are aligned with the hypothesis that early abnormalities in WM play a role in the higher prevalence of falls seen in older adults with MCI. Future studies should explore the potential predictive ability of white matter integrity, incidence of falls and the interplay with onset of dementia.</p><p id="p0195">In summary, we found that older adults with MCI and a recent history of falls may have disrupted structural connectivity. This may be associated with greater decline in both cognition and mobility in this population and subsequently increases their risk of falling.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="or0005">Andersson, J., Jenkinson, M. &amp; Smith, S.

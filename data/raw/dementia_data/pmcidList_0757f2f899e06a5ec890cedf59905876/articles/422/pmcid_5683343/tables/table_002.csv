???,"45 DS subjects, 45 age-matched cognitively normal subjects","Eyes-closed resting EEG data collected, with EOG.","Central, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortex had alpha and beta rhythms with lower amplitude in DS, while delta rhythms were higher in amplitude in DS."
???,"12 with DS/AD/myoclonic epilepsy, over the age of 40","Long-term EEG monitoring during sleep and wake, with EMG and EKG.","3 stages of epilepsy were found: diffuse abnormalities during sleep with dementia onset, myoclonic epilepsy, and finally non-epileptic myoclonus with severe dementia."
???,"21 with DS and dementia, 16 with DS and no dementia","EEG during wake resting state, with EOG and EKG.",Decreased theta band frequencies in several regions of the brain are correlated with cognitive deterioration based on the Dementia Screening Questionnaire in Intellectual Disability.

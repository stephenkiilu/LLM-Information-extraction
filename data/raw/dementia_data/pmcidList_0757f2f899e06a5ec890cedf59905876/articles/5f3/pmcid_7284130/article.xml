CAA is diagnosed by the presence of lobar, cortical or cortical-subcortical hemorrhage including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), or cerebral superficial siderosis (cSS) according to the modified Boston criteria (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg and Charidimou, 2018</xref>). CAA is recognized to be a significant risk for future stroke, transient focal neurological episodes, cognitive impairment, psychiatric and motor disabilities (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Wermer and Greenberg, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Disruption of white matter microstructure, as reflected by diffusion-weighted MR imaging measures, has been associated with functional changes in CAA (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Charidimou et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, a number of brain diffusivity measures have been developed and applied to patients with cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) including, for example, simple measures such as the peak height of mean diffusivity (MD) (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Croall et al., 2017</xref>) as well as more complex measures based on alternative decomposition and integration of the tensors (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Another emerging method that is increasingly being applied is the peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), derived from a histogram of the MD values in the skeletonized white matter tracts (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>). PSMD is a quantitative metric of microstructural disruption of white matter over the whole brain.</p><p id="p0030">PSMD was shown to be significantly associated with processing speed in patients with sporadic cSVD and cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and correlated better with cognition than the WMH volume or number of lacunes (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>). Within the CADASIL group, longitudinal changes in PSMD could be detected over 18 months. PSMD and whole brain white matter MD have been shown to discriminate between hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type genetic carriers and controls (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Schouten et al., 2019</xref>). Advantages of PSMD are that it can be calculated automatically, reflects global brain changes, and should be less affected by partial volume effects with cerebrospinal fluid, a particularly acute problem in older populations with brain atrophy, because it is based on skeletonized white matter tract region-of-interest. However, PSMD has yet to be assessed in a CAA population and it has not been compared to a simpler DTI metric, mean diffusivity (MD).</p><p id="p0035">The objectives of this study were to: 1) assess PSMD values in CAA, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and normal control (NC) groups; 2) evaluate the relationship between PSMD and memory, executive function, and processing speed in CAA; 3) compare the discriminative value of PSMD to a simpler DTI measure, MD of the white matter; and 4) determine if increases in PSMD can be detected after one year. We tested the hypotheses that 1) PSMD is higher in CAA; 2) that higher PSMD is associated with lower processing speed, executive function, and memory; 3) PSMD better discriminates between groups and has stronger associations with cognitive functions than MD; and 4) that the rate of increase in PSMD at one year is higher in CAA than in NC, MCI, and AD.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study participants</title><p id="p0040">This was a retrospective analysis of the ongoing Functional Assessment of Vascular Reactivity (FAVR) study (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Peca et al., 2013</xref>), recruiting patients with CAA, MCI, mild AD and neurologically normal controls. All participants were 55 y of age or older, did not have significant neurological or psychiatric disorders, dementia, or contraindications for MR imaging at 3.0 T. Participants provided informed, signed consent prior to participation in accordance with the University of Calgary research ethics board.</p><p id="p0045">NC participants were recruited from the local community through poster advertisements or from spouses of patients seen at the cognitive disorders clinic. CAA participants were recruited from stroke prevention or memory clinics coordinated through the Foothills Medical Centre. CAA participants were assessed &gt;90 days after symptomatic ICH to avoid confounding effects of edema from acute ICH. Eligibility was based on presentation with a CAA-related syndrome (ICH, cognitive symptoms without dementia, CAA-related inflammation, or transient focal neurological symptoms) accompanied by a pattern of lobar-only cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and superficial siderosis consistent with probable CAA according to modified Boston criteria (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Charidimou et al., 2017</xref>) or criteria for CAA-related inflammation (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Auriel et al., 2016</xref>). Patients with CAA-related inflammation were studied during remission, at a time when no vasogenic edema was visible on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). To reduce the confounding effects of concomitant AD pathology, CAA patients with dementia (according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria) were excluded. CAA participants had to be living in the community and not a long-term care facility, without aphasia or visual field deficits.</p><p id="p0050">MCI participants were recruited through community advertising or from a memory clinic.

Frequency of categorical sample characteristics (e.g. sex) were compared using Pearson’s chi-squared test. PSMD was compared between groups using a general linear model controlling for age and sex, with least-squares means to estimate mean PSMD in each group and Tukey-Kramer test to adjust for multiple post-hoc comparisons. In a secondary analysis, we compared PSMD separately in CAA subgroups with ICH and without ICH. General linear models were used to determine associations between baseline PSMD and baseline cognitive scores, log-transformed baseline WMH volume, log-transformed baseline number of cerebral microbleeds, total SVD score and baseline cortical thickness adjusting for age, sex, and, for analyses of cognition only, years of education. Covariates were standardized to mean of zero and standard deviation of one for these analyses, such that the beta coefficients represent either the change in standard deviations of PSMD per one standard deviation in the covariate (for models of neuroimaging parameters), or the change in standard deviations of the cognitive domain score per one standard deviation change in PSMD. Separate models were run for each cognitive domain score or neuroimaging covariate. Longitudinal changes in PSMD, WMH volume, and cognitive scores were compared using either Pearson or Spearman correlation, as appropriate. Because history of hypertension differed between groups it was added to the models but was then removed because it was no longer significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; .20) after controlling for other variables including group.

Within the CAA group, PSMD and WMH volume were significantly associated with processing speed domain z-score, however, the standardized beta coefficient was higher for PSMD than for WMH indicating a stronger association between PSMD and processing speed. Analyses of the MD histogram showed that both the width (as reflected by PSMD) and mean were shifted toward higher values in CAA compared with other groups. While, PSMD explained more variance in psychomotor processing speed than mean MD, its association with CAA markers was not uniformly stronger. Mean MD was more strongly associated with CAA SVD score and similarly associated with WMH volume. The finding that both the mean and the width of the MD histogram are altered shows that there is a general tendency toward higher white matter diffusivity as well as greater heterogeneity of diffusivity values in CAA. This heterogeneity may reflect the local and remote effects of hemorrhages, microbleeds, and microinfarcts in CAA that interfere with processing speed.</p><p id="p0160">Higher PSMD reflects greater variation in white matter mean diffusivity, which is typically seen when pathological processes disrupt the white matter microarchitecture. Because mean diffusivity is a physical property of tissue it can be directly compared between studies in a similar manner as other physical properties (e.g. blood pressure), although it could still be affected by how the measurements are made. In the current study, PSMD in sporadic CAA (4.97 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) was similar or slightly higher than PSMD reported for other types of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) including patients with sporadic SVD (hypertensive arteriopathy) (3.28 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>), patients with SVD from a memory clinic (4.24 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>), and CADASIL (3.9–5.47 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Vinciguerra et al., 2019</xref>). However, we did not include a sporadic SVD cohort for direct comparison to CAA, a limitation of this study. The PSMD values measured in NC were also similar to previously reported values, (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Vinciguerra et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2019</xref>) supporting that PSMD measurements are relatively robust to differences in diffusion acquisition parameters, MR system manufacturer, and field strength.</p><p id="p0165">These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that white matter damage is a common feature of CAA. A previous case-control study showed that patients with CAA have reduced fractional anisotropy in the temporal white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>). Another study showed that a globally increased apparent diffusion coefficient was associated with pre-hemorrhage cognitive impairment in patients with lobar hemorrhage due to CAA (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>). White matter damage in CAA likely causes cognitive impairment by interrupting white matter connectivity (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Reijmer et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple pathophysiological processes (including WMH, post-ICH changes, inflammation, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and others) likely contribute to changes in PSMD and should be the subject of further study. CMBs are not likely to directly alter PSMD in CAA because they occur in the cerebral cortex or just under it, and the number of CMBs was not associated with PSMD in our study. We found that PSMD was lower, but still higher than controls, after excluding ICH-affected voxels. This suggests that both ICH-related changes (such as tissue destruction, gliosis, and hemosiderin deposition) and chronic processes in the white matter contribute to the abnormal PSMD in CAA.</p><p id="p0170">There are few studies on change in PSMD over time. In this study, we found an increase of approximately 10% over one year. A prior study of CADASIL patients found an increase in PSMD at 18 months, but the amount of increase was not reported (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>). The similar rate of change in PSMD across the study cohorts was unexpected, given that PSMD was higher at baseline in CAA and that WMH increase was detectable. Two potential reasons may be offered. First, the differing rates of change in PSMD may be small and not significant over one year, but when aggregated over a long period of time could lead to large differences. In genetic forms of AD, alterations in PSMD in white matter tracts can be detected in presymptomatic mutation carriers years before the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Araque Caballero et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that white matter changes occur early and could accumulate over a long period of time. The latent period between accumulation of vascular beta-amyloid and onset of symptoms in CAA is essentially unknown, but if it is similar to genetic forms of CAA then the latent period is probably years or even decades. Second, the similar PSMD increase in CAA and controls contrasts with the detectable increase in WMH seen in CAA (but not other groups) but could be because white matter changes are not uniform in CAA, and if they are largely confined to the WMH “penumbra” then they may be averaged out by a global white matter metric like PSMD.</p><p id="p0175">Similar to other studies of SVD (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Baykara et al., 2016</xref>), we found a strong association between higher PSMD and lower cognitive processing speed. This association between PSMD and processing speed was stronger than the association between higher MD and lower cognitive processing speed as indicated by higher standardized beta coefficients and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values. In a study of patients with white matter lesions with and without vascular cognitive impairment, PSMD correlated with executive function and with global cognition in the participants with vascular cognitive impairment (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). In a community-based study of 73-year old persons PSMD was significantly associated with all cognitive domains examined except crystallized ability (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Deary et al., 2019</xref>). In our study it is possible that we were unable to detect significant relationships with MMSE, memory, or executive function due to the limited sample size in each group and the limited range in cognitive z-scores within our study.</p><p id="p0180">A limitation of this study is that we pooled 11- and 25-direction diffusion data. The number of diffusion gradient directions changed for most individuals between the baseline and follow-up scans. The number of participants in each group with 11 diffusion gradient directions at baseline and 25 diffusion gradient directions at follow-up was approximately equally distributed across groups (100% NC, 91% CAA, 90% MCI, and 80% in AD). This protocol change potentially reduced the ability to detect differences in the rate of change in PSMD between groups or may contribute to the difference in PSMD detected between baseline and follow-up. The change in PSMD detected between baseline and follow-up measurements is unlikely to be solely due to this protocol change because: 1) there was no significant difference within the four individuals that had PSMD calculated using both 11- and 25-diffusion gradient directions (see Methods: MR Imaging), 2) of the five individuals who had PSMD calculated using 25-diffusion gradient directions at both baseline and follow-up the mean percent increase (10.3 ± 6.3%) was similar to that reported for all participants (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and 3) prior studies show that increasing the number of diffusion directions from 10 to 20 does not affect regional estimates of mean diffusivity (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al., 2006</xref>). Acquiring more directions may nominally reduce the variance in MD estimates and thus result in lower PSMD, as PSMD is based on the histogram of MD. However, in our study we found that PSMD increased over time despite acquiring more directions at follow-up. Ultimately, new prospectively designed studies will be needed to better define PSMD change over time and the effect of variation in acquisition parameters. Additionally, future studies should compare PSMD to other DTI metrics to identify which are most sensitive to effects of stroke, cognitive change, and change over time. Another limitation is that although we controlled post-hoc for multiple comparisons between participants groups, we did not perform other adjustments for comparisons with multiple imaging markers and cognitive domains. Therefore, the results should be considered exploratory and warrant confirmation in other studies.</p><p id="p0185">These findings show that CAA is associated with changes in the shape of the MD histogram in white matter. Given the demonstrated robustness of PSMD as a marker of diffuse global white matter heterogeneity and lower processing speed, it has potential to detect early changes which warrants further longitudinal research in populations at possible risk of CAA and SVD.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><title>Credit authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0190"><bold>Cheryl R.

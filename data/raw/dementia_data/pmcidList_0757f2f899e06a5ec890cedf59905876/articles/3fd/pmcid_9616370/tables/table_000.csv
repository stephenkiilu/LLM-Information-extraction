"SVDs@target (Small vessel diseases in a mechanistic perspective: Targets for Intervention – Affected pathways and mechanistic exploitation for prevention of stroke and dementia) (www.svds-at-target.eu). The program is funded by Horizon 2020 and includes three clinical studies: ZOOM@SVDs (current paper), INVESTIGATE-SVDs, and TREAT-SVDs. This textbox provides a summary on INVESTIGATE-SVDs and TREAT-SVDs."
"INVESTIGATE-SVDs (Imaging NeuroVascular, Endothelial and STructural InteGrity in prepAration to TrEat Small Vessel Diseases.): PI Prof JM Wardlaw, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences Edinburgh."
"INVESTIGATE-SVDs is a three-centre (Edinburgh, Maastricht, Munich) observational study in 45 patients with sporadic SVDs and in 30 patients with CADASIL. The main objective is to advance knowledge of SVD pathophysiology by assessing the relationship between blood brain barrier integrity, cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2, intracranial vascular and CSF pulsatility, blood pressure and its variability and clinical and structural features of SVD."
"TREAT-SVDs (EffecTs of Amlodipine and other Blood PREssure Lowering Agents on Microvascular FuncTion in Small Vessel Diseases): PI Prof M Dichgans, Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich"
"TREAT-SVDs is a five-centre (Edinburgh, Maastricht, Munich, Oxford, Utrecht), randomized, open-label, crossover trial in 75 patients with sporadic SVDs and 30 patients with CADASIL. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the calcium channel blocker amlodipine has a beneficial effect on small vessel function in patients with symptomatic SVDs when compared to either the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan or the beta-blocker atenolol. The secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that losartan has a beneficial effect on small vessel function compared to atenolol."

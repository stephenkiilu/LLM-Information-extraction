recently added diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), among several other new imaging
modalities, in an effort to identify sensitive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease
(AD). While anatomical MRI is the main structural neuroimaging method used in
most AD studies and clinical trials, DTI is sensitive to microscopic white
matter (WM) changes not detectable with standard MRI, offering additional
markers of neurodegeneration. Prior DTI studies of AD report lower fractional
anisotropy (FA), and increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AxD, RD)
throughout WM. Here we assessed which DTI measures may best identify differences
among AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy elderly
control (NC) groups, in region of interest (ROI) and voxel-based analyses of 155
ADNI participants (mean age: 73.5 ± 7.4; 90
M/65 F; 44 NC, 88 MCI, 23 AD). Both VBA and ROI analyses
revealed widespread group differences in FA and all diffusivity measures. DTI
maps were strongly correlated with widely-used clinical ratings (MMSE, CDR-sob,
and ADAS-cog). When effect sizes were ranked, FA analyses were least sensitive
for picking up group differences. Diffusivity measures could detect more subtle
MCI differences, where FA could not. ROIs showing strongest group
differentiation (lowest <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values) included tracts that
pass through the temporal lobe, and posterior brain regions. The left
hippocampal component of the cingulum showed consistently high effect sizes for
distinguishing groups, across all diffusivity and anisotropy measures, and in
correlations with cognitive scores.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>•</label><p>DTI scans in ADNI2 provide numerous biomarkers of

affecting 1 in 8 people over age 65 in the U.S. alone (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alzheimer's Disease Association,
2012</xref>). Its prevalence is predicted to more than double in the
next 40 years (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Hebert
et al., 2003</xref>). It is important to identify individuals most
likely to develop AD, so that those at greater risk can be treated earlier. One
high-risk group consists of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) — a
transitional stage between normal aging and AD. People with MCI convert to AD at
a rate of about 10–15% per year (<xref rid="bb0015 bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2001; Bruscoli and Lovestone,
2004</xref>). In addition to the more widely-accepted measures from
anatomical MRI, PET, and CSF measures of pathology, one major neuroimaging study
of AD – the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) – recently
incorporated additional neuroimaging techniques including diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) (<xref rid="bb0025 bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Jack et
al., 2010; Jahanshad et al., 2010a; Zhan et al., in press</xref>).
DTI is a variant of MRI that measures the diffusion of water molecules in brain
tissue. Here we set out to assess which standard DTI measures may best identify
neuroanatomical differences between AD, MCI, and normal aging. In the end, DTI
offers a range of measures that might be sensitive to pathology, including
measures of brain connectivity (<xref rid="bb0045 bb0040 bb0065 bb0060 bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Daianu et al.,
2012; Nir et al., 2012; Prasad et al., 2013; Toga and Thompson, 2013; Daianu
et al., accepted for publication; Daianu et al., submitted for
publication</xref>). For these initial analyses, however, we aimed
to analyze more traditional measures and maps that are perhaps most likely to be
used in standardized multi-site DTI analyses, at least in the near future
(<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Jahanshad et al.,
2013</xref>).</p><p>MRI-based image analysis methods have long been used to track
structural atrophy of the aging brain. MRI studies of AD reveal widespread
neuronal loss and atrophy in the brain's gray matter, especially in medial
temporal and hippocampal regions (<xref rid="bb0075 bb0080 bb0085 bb0090 bb0100 bb0095 bb0135 bb0105 bb0110 bb0115 bb0120 bb0125 bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Atiya et al., 2003; Chetelat and Baron, 2003; Thompson et al.,

Desikan et al., 2010b; Chiang et al., 2011; Weiner et al., 2012; Leung et
al., 2013</xref>). Beta-amyloid and tau proteins accumulate in the
brain, leading to inflammation, neuronal atrophy and cell death (<xref rid="bb0140 bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak and Braak,
1995</xref>). As neurons are lost, white matter volume is also
reduced, due to both myelin degeneration and axon loss in neural fiber tracts
(<xref rid="bb0150 bb0155 bb0160 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Braak and
Braak, 1996; Bartzokis, 2011; Braskie et al., 2011; Hua et al.,
2013</xref>). Standard anatomical MRI is still the imaging
technique most often used in AD studies and clinical trials, but DTI is
sensitive to microscopic changes in white matter (WM) integrity not always
detectable with standard anatomical MRI (<xref rid="bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2006; Canu et al., 2010</xref>). Although
this is debatable until more evidence is collected, some DTI changes may even
precede and predict volume loss (<xref rid="bb0180 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Hugenschmidt et al., 2008; Nir et al., 2012</xref>),
making it a potentially beneficial tool for capturing additional or
complementary markers of early neurodegeneration. Carriers of some AD risk genes
show differences on DTI as young adults, decades before the typical age of onset
of AD (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Braskie et al.,
2011</xref>).</p><p>Fractional anisotropy (FA) is perhaps the most widely accepted
DTI measure and reflects how directionally constrained the diffusion of water is
along axons. While higher FA values may imply more coherent or intact axons, or
a higher degree of myelination, lower FA may reflect loss of WM integrity and
injury. These physiological correlates of the DTI signal are widely accepted,
but the differences may have other interpretations, especially where fibers
cross (<xref rid="bb0185 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Leow et al., 2009; Zhan
et al., 2009</xref>). Mean diffusivity (MD) captures the average
rate of diffusion in all directions, and generally increases with WM injury,
especially if normal barriers to diffusion are damaged (such as myelin sheaths
on axons). Axial diffusivity (AxD) captures diffusion parallel to axonal fibers,
while radial diffusivity (RD) reflects perpendicular diffusion. These measures
are linked to axonal injury and demyelination, respectively (<xref rid="bb0195 bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2003; Song et al.,
2005</xref>). To date, numerous DTI studies of AD and MCI find that
greater cognitive impairment, or poorer diagnosis, is associated with lower FA
in the corpus callosum, fornix, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and
inferior longitudinal fasciculus (<xref rid="bb0205 bb0210 bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Ukmar et al., 2008; Stricker
et al., 2009; Mielke et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011</xref>) and DTI
measures correlate with widely used clinical or cognitive ratings including the
mini-mental state exam (MMSE) (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Bozzali
et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Despite growing diffusion imaging evidence of AD-related WM
changes, it is not clear which regions and DTI measures are the most sensitive
for detecting diagnostic differences. In order to evaluate the power of drug
trial treatment to counteract degeneration, optimizing statistical power for
discerning differences and changes is crucial. We focused this current paper on
cross-sectional differences in patients and controls, as there are a number of
DTI measures, regions, and approaches that need to be compared and ranked in
terms of their effect sizes for picking up group differences. We set out to rank
the effect sizes for different DTI-based scalar measures in detecting
differences in both white matter voxel-based analyses (VBA) and within regions
of interest (ROIs). We first examined differences in DTI anisotropy and
diffusivity measures, between groups of cognitively healthy normal elderly
controls (NC), MCI, and AD patients in both voxel-based and ROI analyses. We
also examined the association of anisotropy and diffusivity maps with widely
used clinical or cognitive ratings including the MMSE (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Folstein et al., 1975</xref>), the
“sum-of-boxes” clinical dementia rating (CDR-sob) (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Berg, 1988</xref>), and the Alzheimer's Disease
Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et al., 1984</xref>). Finally, in a supplementary test, we
compared our ROI results to ROIs extracted along the skeleton from the widely
used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the popularity of
FA, we hypothesized that we would find the highest effect size and
discriminative power for MD measures, as recently suggested in a review of DTI
studies of AD by Clerx et al. (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Clerx et
al., 2012</xref>). We also hypothesized that we would find the
greatest differences in temporal lobe WM and the corpus callosum (CC), as the
temporal lobe is usually the earliest region to be affected by amyloid and tau
pathology in AD and DTI studies are often better powered to find group
differences in regions such as the CC where fiber coherence is
highest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Clinical sample and

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to provide a global measure of
cognitive status, based on evaluating cognitive domains including
orientation to place, orientation to time, registration, attention and
concentration, recall, language, and visual construction (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Folstein et al., 1975</xref>). The
total score ranges from 1 to 30, with lower scores indicating impairment.
The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was also used as a global measure of
dementia severity (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Berg,
1988</xref>). The “sum-of-boxes” CDR (CDR-sob) score is the sum
of 6 measures each assessing the degree of impairment in memory,
orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and
hobbies, and personal care. The CDR-sob score ranges from 0 to 18 (no
dementia to severe dementia, respectively). Finally the Alzheimer's Disease
Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog), a global measure encompassing memory,
reasoning, language, orientation, ideational, praxis and constructional
praxis (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et al.,
1984</xref>), was collected where scores range from 0 to 70 (no
dementia to severe dementia respectively). In
<italic toggle="yes">post-hoc</italic> analyses, we further homed in on
specific cognitive domains using the available ADNI composite scores for
executive function (ADNI-EF) (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons et al., 2012</xref>) and memory (ADNI-MEM)
(<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Crane et al.,
2012</xref>) derived using data from the ADNI neuropsychological
battery. Detailed psychometric calculation protocols are available for
download at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ida.loni.ucla.edu/" id="ir0105">https://ida.loni.ucla.edu/</ext-link>. ADNI-EF was
calculated using a combination of WAIS-R Digit Symbol Substitution, Digit
Span Backwards, Trails A and B, Category Fluency, and Clock Drawing scores
(<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons et al.,
2012</xref>) and ADNI-MEM was calculated as a composite of the
Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), ADAS-Cog, and Logical Memory data
(<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Crane et al.,
2012</xref>).</p><p>Demographics and diagnostic information for the participants
are shown in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Diagnostic
groups did not differ in age, however, education, an AD risk factor
(<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Sattler et al.,
2012</xref>), was marginally significant between controls and
AD. As would be expected, clinical measures that index cognitive decline
(MMSE, ADAS-cog, CDR-sob, ADNI-MEM, ADNI-EF) did show significant graded
differences between groups.</p><p>We further assessed whether these measures revealed more
fine-grained differences between the l-MCI and e-MCI subgroups. We found
differences in ADAS-cog scores — a measure developed specifically for
Alzheimer's disease, and the most widely used primary outcome measure in
clinical trials that test AD drug treatment efficacy (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Mohs et al., 1983</xref>). ADNI-MEM
was also significantly different as it is calculated using both ADAS-cog and
Logical Memory data, the measure used to initially classify the two MCI
subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>MRI and DTI scanning</title><p>All subjects underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on 3 Tesla GE Medical Systems scanners at 14 acquisition sites

T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b<sub>0</sub>
images) and 41 diffusion-weighted images (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). This protocol was chosen after conducting a
detailed comparison of several different DTI protocols, to optimize the
signal-to-noise ratio in a fixed scan time (<xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Jahanshad et al., 2010a; Zhan et al.,

head motion and eddy current distortions. All extra-cerebral tissue was
roughly removed from the T1-weighted anatomical scans using a number of
software packages, primarily ROBEX, a robust automated brain extraction
program trained on manually “skull-stripped” MRI data (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>) and
FreeSurfer (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Fischl et al.,

inspected, and the best one selected and sometimes further manually
edited. Anatomical scans subsequently underwent intensity inhomogeneity

Non-brain tissue was also removed from the diffusion-weighted images
using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from FSL (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2002</xref>). To align
data from different subjects into the same 3D coordinate space, each
T1-weighted anatomical image was linearly aligned to a standard brain
template (the downsampled Colin27 (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 1998</xref>): 110 × 110 × 110, with 2 mm isotropic voxels) using
FSL <italic toggle="yes">flirt</italic> (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>) with 6 degrees of
freedom (dof) to allow translations and rotations in 3D. To correct for
echo-planar imaging (EPI) induced susceptibility artifacts, which can
cause distortions at tissue–fluid interfaces, skull-stripped
b<sub>0</sub> images were linearly aligned (FSL
<italic toggle="yes">flirt</italic> 9 dof) and then elastically registered
to their respective T1-weighted structural scans using an
inverse-consistent registration algorithm with a mutual information cost
function (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Leow et al.,
2007</xref>) as described in (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Jahanshad et al., 2010b</xref>). The resulting
3D deformation fields were then applied to the remaining 41 DWI volumes
prior to estimating diffusion parameters. To account for the linear
registration of the DWI images to the structural T1-weighted scan, a
corrected gradient table was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3.2</label><title>DTI maps</title><p>A single diffusion tensor (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Basser et al., 1994</xref>), or ellipsoid, was
modeled at each voxel in the brain from the eddy- and EPI-corrected DWI
scans using FSL <italic toggle="yes">dtifit</italic>, and scalar anisotropy and
diffusivity maps were obtained from the resulting diffusion tensor
eigenvalues (λ<sub>1</sub>, λ<sub>2</sub>,
λ<sub>3</sub>) which capture the length of the longest,
middle, and shortest axes of the ellipsoid. The tensor model in DTI has
limitations, especially in regions where fibers cross, but we do not
investigate it further here; our other papers consider this in more

the longitudinal diffusivity, or the diffusivity parallel to axonal
fibers (assuming of course that the principal eigenvector is indeed
following the dominant fiber direction, which may be unclear in regions

This is not the atlas that had the problem pointed out by <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Rohlfing (2013)</xref>. We then
superimposed the atlas ROIs into the same coordinate space as our
results. We removed 10 ROIs from the analyses (including the left and
right middle cerebellar peduncle, pontine crossing tract, medial
lemniscus, inferior and superior peduncles) as they often fell partially
or completely out of the field-of-view (FOV) of the images. We also
excluded the body of the fornix as it is small and prone to
misregistration and partial voluming. AD researchers are specifically
interested in the fornix as it is the primary posterior pathway coming
out of the back of the hippocampus, a key target of pathology. While we
included the crus of the fornix/<italic toggle="yes">stria terminalis</italic>,
the body is just too small to be resolved well on DTI at this
resolution. In addition to the JHU labels, 4 more ROIs were evaluated:
bilateral genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (as opposed to
just the lateralized measures), as well as the entire corpus callosum,
and a large “TOTAL” WM ROI made up of all the other ROIs, to obtain
total summary measures of these regions. We were then able to calculate
the average FA, MD, RD and AxD, within the boundaries of each of the 43

resulting 3D deformation fields were then applied to the three
diffusivity maps. All subjects' spatially normalized FA, MD, RD and AxD
data were projected onto the skeletonized ENIGMA-DTI template. Mean
anisotropy and diffusivity measures were calculated along the skeleton
in the same 43 ROIs (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This type of analysis has been used

(<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Gutman et al.,

elderly control (NC) spatially aligned FA maps. An MDT deviates, on
average, the least (in some metric) from the anatomy of the subjects,
and can often improve registration accuracy and statistical power
(<xref rid="bb0355 bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Gutman et al.,
2012; Lepore et al., 2007</xref>). The MDT was generated by
creating an initial affine mean template from all 29 subjects, then
registering all the aligned individual scans to that mean using a fluid
registration (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Leow et al.,

new mean was created from the registered scans; this process was
iterated several times. Each subject's initial FA map was elastically
registered to the final MDT and the resulting deformation fields were
applied to the 3 diffusivity maps to align them to the same coordinate
space. To ensure white matter alignment across subjects, registered FA
maps were thresholded at FA &gt; 0.2
to include only highly anisotropic anatomy and the thresholded maps were
elastically registered to the thresholded MDT (FA &gt; 0.2). Again, the resulting deformation

and MMSE, CDR-sob, and ADAS-cog scores, controlling for age and sex, across
the entire study sample (i.e., including all AD, MCI and NC subjects), and
also within each subgroup. We also ran all of the regressions using a

limit statistical testing to white matter, where the power is greater to
detect differences, statistics were run only on voxels within the boundaries

(<xref rid="f0005 f0010 f0015 f0020 f0025" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1–5</xref>) were
thresholded at the FDR critical <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value.</p><p>To visualize and compare effect sizes in the anisotropy and

functions (CDF) of the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values obtained from the
voxel-wise and ROI random-effects regressions. The ordered set of observed
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values was plotted against the expected null
distribution. If there are no group differences (a null distribution), then
the plot would fall approximately along the <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> diagonal line.
However, if the CDF initially rises at a rate steeper than 20 times the null
CDF (<italic toggle="yes">y</italic> = 20<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>), then the corresponding maps are FDR
significant at <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.05. A greater slope reflects a larger effect size; the FDR critical
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value (at <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.05) is the point at which the curve
intersects the <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> = 20<italic toggle="yes">x</italic> line.</p><p>DTI measures calculated from a single-tensor diffusion model
have limitations in regions with extensive fiber crossing. For example, in
AD we might expect FA deficits throughout the brain, but FA may appear to be
artificially <italic toggle="yes">increased</italic> where crossing fibers
deteriorate (<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Douaud et al.,
2011</xref>). To make sure that these results were not false
positives we separated the full <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value map
(irrespective of the significance level of the voxels) into two maps: (1)
voxels that showed a negative association, and (2) positively associated
voxels. We then independently corrected each <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-map
for multiple statistical comparisons using FDR (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative way to visualize white matter integrity
differences between patients and controls, we also created maps showing the
“percent difference” in mean DTI measures between AD patients and NC, within
the FDR significant regions.<disp-formula id="fo0020"><mml:math id="M4" altimg="si4.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">%Diff</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">AD</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">NC</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">NC</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>There is a mild bias in doing this, in that it selects

deficits in fiber integrity (lower FA) compared to healthy controls,
throughout the WM across the entire brain, when using a general
linear regression model to adjust for age and sex (critical
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.016; 31.9% of voxels survived the FDR threshold (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995</xref>); minimum <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value,
1.65 × 10<sup>− 8</sup>). However, when we used a
random-effects regression model at every voxel to take into account
acquisition site differences, we found more significant and even
more widespread results (critical <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.020; 40.1% of voxels
survived the FDR threshold (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>); minimum

<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a).
We therefore proceeded with this model – fitting a site effect – for
the remainder of the analyses. A few significant voxels exhibited
associations in a direction opposite to the great majority of the
brain map, and contrary to what would traditionally be accepted as
showing impairment. For example, we found regions where the AD group
had a higher mean FA (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e; <italic toggle="yes">blue regions</italic>).
These regions were largely found at the junction of the corpus
callosum commissural fibers and the <italic toggle="yes">corona
radiata</italic>. Such regions are notorious for fiber
crossings, which may artificially reduce FA, if FA is estimated
using the single-tensor diffusion model (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Oishi et al., 2011</xref>).
This pattern has been reported in other AD studies, and may reflect
a selective sparing or selective degeneration of one of the pathways
in a region with crossing fibers (<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Douaud et al., 2011</xref>). When we
separated (and independently FDR-corrected) the map of voxels that
showed a negative association with AD and the map of the positively
associated voxels, the diffuse negative associations were still
significant, but the previously significant positive associations
were not.</p><p>This pervasive pattern of significance was largely
replicated for the three other diffusivity measures. As predicted,
we found higher mean RD, AxD and MD values in AD patients relative
to controls (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b–d) and the effects were larger and even
more diffuse than for FA. CDF plots confirm that FA was not the most
sensitive measure for differentiating groups. Comparisons of NC to
AD patients (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a) revealed that RD was the most sensitive
measure followed closely by MD.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>3.1.1.2</label><title>Early, late and all MCI vs

associated with lower MMSE scores, indicative of greater impairment.
<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b
shows WM regions where FA and diffusivity differences correlated

impairment have the potential to emerge as useful clinical tools for
differentiating diagnostic groups in studies of AD. We had three main findings:
(1) in ROI and VBA analyses, we found widespread anisotropy and diffusivity
disruptions, often in tracts that pass through the temporal lobe and posterior
brain regions (especially the left hippocampal cingulum), in elderly AD and MCI
patients; (2) these disruptions were also associated with neuropsychological and
cognitive deficits; and (3) diffusivity (MD, RD, AxD) measures were more
sensitive for detecting differences than FA measures, and could detect more
subtle MCI differences, where FA could not.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss and
widespread gray matter atrophy, but it is also marked by a disturbance in the
brain's WM pathways, perhaps secondary to the effect of cortical neuronal loss.
Changes in white matter neuropathology include partial loss of axons, myelin
sheaths, and oligodendroglial cells (<xref rid="bb0395 bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Brun and Englund, 1986; Sjobeck et al., 2005</xref>).
AD patients have been shown to have significantly more WM hyperintensities (WMH)
than controls. WMH are significantly related to cortical atrophy (<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Capizzano et al., 2004</xref>) entorhinal
cortex (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., in
press</xref>), and hippocampal atrophy (<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">de Leeuw et al., 2004</xref>) in AD patients.
Significant WM atrophy has also been reported (<xref rid="bb0420 bb0425 bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2008; Hua et al., 2010;
Migliaccio et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There is growing diffusion imaging evidence of AD related WM
changes as well. Most studies report lower FA and higher MD in all lobes of the
brain in both MCI and AD when compared to cognitively healthy controls, with
emphasis on medial temporal lobe structures (<xref rid="bb0435 bb0225 bb0440 bb0445 bb0450 bb0455 bb0170 bb0460 bb0465 bb0470" ref-type="bibr">Kantarci et al., 2001; Bozzali et al., 2002; Takahashi et al.,

Braak, 1991; Braak and Braak, 1995; Thompson et al., 2007</xref>)
and our results. Many DTI methods have been used to assess WM differences in AD
including TBSS (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al.,
2006</xref>) and tract or connectivity analyses (<xref rid="bb0045 bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Daianu et al., 2012; Daianu et al.,
accepted for publication; Daianu et al., submitted for
publication</xref>). Here we use the most common methods, VBA and
ROI analyses, with ROIs based on a stereotaxic WM ROI atlas (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2008</xref>), which has been
shown to accurately parcellate anatomical regions in AD patients with severe
atrophy (<xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Oishi et al.,
2009</xref>). Using predetermined, template-based ROIs can limit
findings and registration across subjects may vary due to morphological
differences. However, using a common atlas helps to make quantification
efficient and easier to standardize across sites (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Jahanshad et al., 2013</xref>). Given that VBA findings
are diffuse, ROIs are arguably helpful to begin to rank the most sensitive
regions for detecting group differences.</p><p>When comparing AD patients to NC, the CC

with limited spatial and directional resolution are often better powered to find
deficits in regions where the FA and fiber coherence is highest, such as the

control groups is surprising in light of other studies showing that these groups
often differ on other neuroimaging measures. This may be due the small sample
size and also heterogeneity in the MCI cohort. The MCI group referred to in
papers using ADNI1 data is now called late MCI (l-MCI) in ADNI2. In ADNI2, the
majority of the MCI group includes the enrollment of a new cohort called early
MCI (e-MCI), with milder episodic memory impairment than the l-MCI group. Among
the MCI subjects with DTI data available, a smaller percent will be l-MCI than
in phase one of ADNI, perhaps contributing to the apparent discrepancy with
other ADNI studies/results. This difference in the ADNI2 versus ADNI1 and other
MCI cohorts should be considered in expectations of what the effect sizes should
be.</p><p>Strongest ROI associations with cognitive scores in the full
cohort were consistently found in the left hippocampal part of the cingulum
across all anisotropy and diffusivity measures. The total ROI map was also one
of the top 10 lowest <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values in almost all FA and
diffusivity analyses, while left cingulum and bilateral sagittal stratum were in
the lowest 10 in all diffusivity analyses. The bilateral inferior
fronto-occipital fasciculus was in the lowest 10 in almost all full cohort
diffusivity analyses. When it came to picking up subtle differences within the
MCI group, CDR-sob scores were most widely correlated with diffusivity in both
VBA and ROI analyses. Prior studies also suggest that CDR-sob is a more
sensitive clinical assessment than ADAS-cog and MMSE, and it may better relate
to measures of atrophy on anatomical MRI (<xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Post-hoc analyses were conducted to assess if there was any
association between DTI summary measures and executive function (ADNI-EF) and
memory (ADNI-MEM) scores. These analyses revealed some of the strongest
associations in temporal lobe tracts that subserve a variety of functions known
to deteriorate during aging, including the bilateral sagittal stratum, that
carries parts of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior
longitudinal fasciculus, the hippocampal cingulum as well as the cingulum.
ADNI-EF associations were additionally found in the total ROI and superior
longitudinal fasciculus, while ADNI-MEM was associated with DTI measures in the
external capsule, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus.
These regional differences could shed light on the network of brain regions,
connected via white matter fiber bundles, involved in each task. Prior DTI
studies have linked similar regions to performance in executive function and
memory (<xref rid="bb0490 bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Kantarci et al., 2011;
Sasson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As patterns of differences were often diffuse across the VBA WM
map, the total WM ROI was sometimes one of the 10 lowest
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values, but it was never the absolute best.
Therefore assessing individual ROIs may offer slightly more power to detect
changes than a global summary measure (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Jahanshad et al., 2013</xref>). In general, the most significant
ROIs were found mainly in the left hemisphere (for example, the left hippocampal
part of the cingulum was in the top 10 ROIs in by far the most analyses), which
has also been found in some prior MRI and DTI studies (<xref rid="bb0505 bb0515 bb0510 bb0085 bb0520" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1996;
Thompson et al., 2001; Scahill et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2003; Muller
et al., 2005</xref>). A supplementary analysis revealed no evidence
of greater variability in ROI measures in the right hemisphere that may be
causing the better performance of left hemisphere ROIs (see supplementary text).
TBSS ROI results did not differ dramatically from the full average ROI results
and left hippocampal cingulum was again ‘top 10’ in the most analyses; however,
it was closely followed by the right hippocampal cingulum.</p><p>Aside from the total ROI and bilateral IFO, the ROIs that were
consistently significant in at least two analyses (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) corroborate a pattern of degeneration in
the temporal lobe and posterior temporo-parietal circuitry found in many other
DTI studies of MCI and AD (<xref rid="bb0525 bb0530 bb0535 bb0470" ref-type="bibr">Head et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2007; Chua et al., 2008;
Stebbins and Murphy, 2009</xref>); these include limbic tracts in
the parahippocampal white matter, posterior cingulum, fornix, and splenium of
the CC, and have been linked to lower cognitive scores (<xref rid="bb0540 bb0225 bb0440 bb0545 bb0445 bb0550 bb0555 bb0450 bb0455 bb0460 bb0560 bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2000; Bozzali et al., 2002; Takahashi et al., 2002;

2007; Medina and Gaviria, 2008; Mielke et al., 2009</xref>). DTI
studies have found lower anisotropy in the white matter pathway of the cingulate
gyrus, particularly the posterior cingulum, which connects to the entorhinal
cortex and plays a role in the cholinergic system, known to be impaired in AD
(<xref rid="bb0565 bb0570 bb0440 bb0450 bb0460" ref-type="bibr">Perry, 1980; Selden et al., 1998; Takahashi et al., 2002; Medina et al.,

implicated in studies comparing MCI to controls, especially on the left as in
our study (<xref rid="bb0550 bb0450 bb0455 bb0460 bb0535" ref-type="bibr">Fellgiebel et al., 2005; Medina et al., 2006; Rose et al., 2006; Zhang et
al., 2007; Chua et al., 2008</xref>). Cognitive scores like MMSE
have also been linked to DTI diffusivity values in the posterior cingulate gyrus
in AD (<xref rid="bb0545 bb0550" ref-type="bibr">Yoshiura et al., 2002;
Fellgiebel et al., 2005</xref>). Most AD studies also find WM
deficits in the corpus callosum, but it is not clear whether the genu is more
affected (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al.,
2006</xref>), in line with the hypothesis that later maturing
regions are the first affected, or the splenium, corroborating a pattern of
degeneration in the posterior temporal parietal circuitry (<xref rid="bb0440 bb0450 bb0555" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2002; Medina et

healthy aging, DTI abnormalities occur in the frontal regions, specifically the

while in AD DTI abnormalities are concentrated in the posterior regions. Some
studies have dissociated the regional effects of age and dementia, with age
effects greater in the anterior corpus callosum and frontal white matter,
suggesting an anterior-to-posterior gradient, while individuals with early-stage
dementia exhibit minimal additional frontal deficits, but rather show greater
white matter deterioration in posterior lobar regions (<xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Head et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>As in prior studies of aging and AD
(<xref rid="bb0575 bb0580" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2010;
Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010</xref>), FA was the
<italic toggle="yes">least</italic> sensitive measure when comparing diagnostic
groups and cognitive score associations in both ROI and VBA analyses
(<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A recent
study found that FA measured using TBSS was more strongly associated with
spectroscopic measurements than FA measured using voxel-wise averaging which is
susceptible to partial-averaging artifacts (<xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">Wijtenburg et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found that
TBSS ROI results were not substantially different from data computed from
averaging diffusion indices in ROIs (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="boxed-text">Inline Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). A recent AD DTI review –
based on 55 different studies – noted that MD values have more discriminative
power than FA values and higher effect sizes for case–control differences in the
frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Clerx et al., 2012</xref>). To explain age related
increases in MD without significant FA changes, <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2011)</xref> suggested that brain
degeneration in aging may be caused, in part, by tissue damage due to processes
such as focal ischemia. This may result in lower tissue density, increasing
water diffusivity but maintaining underlying directional structure. FA and MD
are summary measures based on the ratio and mean of the eigenvalues
respectively, but AxD may reflect axonal injury, and RD may reflect
demyelination (<xref rid="bb0195 bb0200 bb0595 bb0600" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006; Hofling et al.,

and VBA analyses, RD was the most strongly associated with WM deficits
(<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a–b), followed
by MD. Increased RD in AD relative to controls, therefore, may reflect
demyelination in AD. As in prior studies that reported AxD increases in normal
aging and Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bb0445 bb0575 bb0580 bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Fellgiebel et al., 2004;
Sullivan et al., 2010; Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010; Agosta et al.,
2011</xref>), we also found higher AxD in MCI, AD, and associated
with clinical impairment. In fact, we found slightly larger effect sizes for AxD
when comparing CN and l-MCI subjects in the VBA analyses and CN and MCI subjects
in the full ROI analyses (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>b). Recent longitudinal and cross-sectional studies
suggest that AxD might be more sensitive to detecting early changes, while RD
becomes progressively better as disease progresses (<xref rid="bb0610 bb0615" ref-type="bibr">O'Dwyer et al., 2011; Acosta-Cabronero et
al., 2012</xref>). In a study by Bendlin et al. (2012),
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD, T-Tau and Aβ<sub>42</sub>, predicted
axial and radial diffusivity, suggesting these CSF biomarkers are potentially
related to both neuronal axon integrity and health of oligodendrocyte
synthesized myelin. The relationship may have a common cause, if cerebral
amyloid and tau burden is related to CSF measures and to axonal loss and poorer
myelination. Ultimately, the positive relationships between AD and both AxD and
RD may explain why FA, a function of the ratio of these measures, reveals the
least differences (<xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero et

tensor model, may not capture the complexity of white matter architecture. DTI
has some limitations in gauging fiber integrity in regions with extensive fiber
crossing and mixing. High angular diffusion imaging (HARDI) can better resolve
white matter multi-fiber distribution than DTI single-tensor models
(<xref rid="bb0185 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Leow et al., 2009; Zhan et
al., 2009</xref>). More sophisticated measures, such as a modified
version of FA calculated from the HARDI data “tensor distribution function”
(TDF), can better characterize the anisotropy in regions of fiber crossings
(<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Zhan et al., 2009</xref>),
and may better reveal FA differences that are due to loss in fiber coherence
rather than simply partial-volume effects.</p><p>Further limitations of this study include the
small sample size from each of the 14 sites, and unequal distribution of cases
across sites (see <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Inline Supplementary

effects regression model and grouping the data by acquisition site, some
cross-site differences may be unaccounted for in the study design. Additionally
we did not adjust for WMH burden, or explore the extent the DTI metrics
corresponded with WMH. Finally, the ADNI data set is constantly re-evaluating
subject diagnosis, cognitive, and basic demographic data. The data evaluated

and monitoring of cognitive decline. We found anisotropy and even more
widespread diffusivity disruptions in projection, association, and commissural
tracts, particularly in tracts that pass through the temporal lobe and posterior
brain regions (especially the left hippocampal cingulum), in elderly AD and MCI
patients. These disruptions were associated with neuropsychological and
cognitive deficits. As ADNI2 progresses, new subjects are scanned and new
measures of WMH are being added to the database. These results should be
verified with larger sample sizes and the relationship between DTI based WM
disturbances and WMH can be further resolved. Future tract-based connectivity
studies may also shed light on how integrity in the tracts affects regional gray
matter. We may also be able to create a statistical region-of-interest that may
outperform atlas based ROIs (<xref rid="bb0165 bb0625" ref-type="bibr">Hua et al., 2013; Gutman et al., 2013</xref>). ADNI2 is a
longitudinal study that will eventually allow us to investigate which of these
subjects develop AD, and if these early WM aberrations help predict future
deficits and conversion to AD. Future studies combining machine learning methods
with different modalities – including CSF and proteomic markers – may ultimately
determine the best way to distinguish diagnostic groups.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0580"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0560"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Acosta-Cabronero</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>G.B.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Pengas</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Nestor</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Absolute diffusivities define the landscape of white

cingulum, temporal lobe (including the hippocampal part of the cingulum) and

greatest effect sizes in the maps. (d) Significant but slightly less profuse FA

(e) <italic toggle="yes">Beta</italic>-values (non-normalized slope of the regression)

notorious for crossing fibers, where AD patients have higher mean FA than
controls (<italic toggle="yes">dark blue</italic>), contrary to what would
traditionally be accepted as showing impairment. (Bottom panel) Maps show the

between AD patients and NC within FDR significant regions. Again, the corpus
callosum, temporal lobe, cingulum (including the hippocampal part of the
cingulum), and the posterior thalamic radiations show the greatest degree of
difference (up to ~ 33%); we note that the significance values
and effect sizes in these regions depend on the mean group differences and its
standard error, which is more completely reflected in top panels. In both
figures, MD and RD differences are greater and more widespread. (For

and NC group comparisons and clinical cognitive test associations reveal that FA
is consistently the least sensitive measure. This type of plot is used to
compare effect sizes in statistical maps based on different diffusivity
measures. We used it to help decide which DTI measures best distinguish the
diagnostic groups. Here we show cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots of
the distribution of the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values obtained from (a,d)
voxel-wise and (b–c) ROI linear regressions, which are subjected to multiple
comparisons correction using standard FDR (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). (a) VBA
comparisons of NC to AD patients revealed that RD was the most sensitive measure
(denoted by the higher critical <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values controlling the
FDR/the highest non-zero <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-coordinate where the CDF
crosses the <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> = 20<italic toggle="yes">x</italic> line) followed closely by MD. (b) ROI
comparisons of NC vs AD confirm that FA was the <italic toggle="yes">least
sensitive</italic> measure. (c) ROI comparisons of NC vs MCI reveal that
AxD measures had the largest effect size, followed by MD (VBA comparisons were
not significant). (d) Voxel-wise and (e) ROI linear regressions on associations
between cognitive scores (MMSE, CDR-sob, and ADAS-cog) in the entire cohort and
anisotropy and diffusivity measures confirm that FA associations, while FDR
significant, show the smallest effect size, while MD and RD have the largest
effect sizes.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="gr2.jpg"/></fig><fig id="f0015" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Statistical maps show the − log<sub>10</sub><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values within regions where l-MCI subjects exhibit

Here, we used the mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI framework, which is suitable to characterize complex microstructure, to investigate age-related cerebral differences in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired participants and compared the results to those derived using diffusion tensor imaging. We studied MAP-MRI metrics, among them the non-Gaussianity (NG) and propagator anisotropy (PA), and established an opposing pattern in white matter of higher NG alongside lower PA among older adults, likely indicative of axonal degradation. In gray matter, however, these two indices were consistent with one another, and exhibited regional pattern heterogeneity compared to other microstructural parameters, which could indicate fewer neuronal projections across cortical layers along with an increased glial concentration. In addition, we report regional variations in the magnitude of age-related microstructural differences consistent with the posterior-anterior shift in aging paradigm. These results encourage further investigations in cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Brain aging</kwd><kwd>Mean apparent propagator (MAP)</kwd><kwd>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)</kwd><kwd>Non-Gaussianity</kwd><kwd>Maturation</kwd><kwd>Degeneration</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Age is the main risk factor for prevalent diseases and conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. It is crucial to characterize changes, including in cerebral microstructure, that occur with normative aging and to distinguish them from changes caused by disease. Consequently, there is a critical need for accurate and sensitive imaging biomarkers that reflect early pathological changes before the development of severe neuronal loss and to, ultimately, help facilitate early interventions. Several lines of research have demonstrated that quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers unique advantages as a diagnostic or response imaging biomarker in neurology. The last 3 decades have seen a myriad of advanced methods to characterize cerebral microstructure with unprecedented sensitivity, based mostly on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Basser et al., 1994</xref>) and relaxometry. This extensive work has revealed complex and nonlinear age-related trajectories of cerebral tissues during brain maturation and degeneration (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Driscoll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Resnick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Westlye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2014</xref>). Although DTI’s classical tensor model was shown to be sensitive to age-related microstructural changes (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Schilling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Storsve et al., 2016</xref>), it relies on the assumption that water diffusion in the brain is unrestricted and follows a Gaussian distribution (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Basser et al., 1994</xref>). However, the presence of cell membranes and other barriers creates a complex environment in which water diffusion often follows a non-Gaussian distribution (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Novikov et al., 2018</xref>). Brain microstructures therefore cannot be adequately described by the tensor model, and as a result, biases may be introduced in the corresponding diffusion metrics. To address this, multi-compartment biophysical diffusion models have been introduced (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Assaf and Basser, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Jespersen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Stanisz et al., 1997</xref>), most notably, the Neurite Orientation Distribution and Density Imaging (NODDI) model (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). NODDI employs the “standard model” of brain microstructure, in which neural tissue consists of three compartments: impermeable straight cylinders with negligible diameter, and anisotropic and isotropic diffusion tensors. While this biophysical model may be suitable for white matter (WM), recent studies have shown it does not hold in gray matter (GM) (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Jespersen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">McKinnon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Veraart et al., 2019</xref>). And indeed, NODDI has been mostly used to capture age-related changes in cerebral microstructure exclusively in WM (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Pines et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2020</xref>). Recently introduced, the Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Palombo et al., 2020</xref>) framework attempts to model GM more explicitly. Nevertheless, it shares a second limitation of all biophysical models, namely the strict assumptions about the underlying tissue composition, compartments, and physical properties. Therefore, despite their potential greater specificity, the derived parameters are dramatically dependent on these underlying assumptions (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lampinen et al., 2019</xref>), which could hamper their sensitivity to early changes due to pathology or aging. Specifically, significant alterations of myelin-related processes during aging (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Bouhrara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Marner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Sandell and Peters, 2001</xref>), along with changes in fiber diameters (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Giorgio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Paus et al., 2008</xref>), can allow exchange between compartments and affect the diffusion signal in complex ways. As the axons and myelin sheets are lost, they are replaced by new astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Sandell and Peters, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), further confounding the biological interpretation of the dMRI biophysical models assessment.</p><p id="P3">A different approach to circumvent the limitation of DTI and multi-compartment biophysical models, the mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Özarslan et al., 2013</xref>) is a recently developed clinically feasible diffusion MRI framework, which makes no a priori presuppositions regarding the behavior of water diffusion in tissues, and is therefore suitable for use in healthy and diseased WM and GM. Instead of being limited to representing diffusion as ellipsoids (i.e., DTI) or assuming the separability of specific tissue compartment (i.e., NODDI, SANDI), MAP-MRI explicitly measures the diffusion propagators (i.e., the probability density function of 3D net displacements of diffusing water molecules) in each voxel and can in theory capture arbitrary fiber configurations. The measured propagators provide a complete description of the diffusion processes in tissues that can be used to derive microstructural parameters (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2017</xref>) obtained with other methods such as DTI or diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, MAP-MRI subsumes other diffusion MRI (dMRI) methods, such as DTI, providing parameters like the fractional anisotropy (FA), the mean, axial, and radial diffusivities (MD, AD, and RD, respectively). This method offers a more comprehensive, delicate, and accurate tissue characterization than the tensor model by quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of the diffusion process, reflecting physiologically significant microstructural characteristics with a higher degree of neuroanatomical specificity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al., 2019</xref>), and is suitable for studying unknown tissue alterations that may occur during aging, disease, regeneration, and due to microflow (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In addition to second and fourth order diffusion tensor quantities, which correspond to DTI and DKI, respectively, a new family of diffusion parameters can be computed from MAP-MRI. The first set of these scalar parameters is called zero-displacement metrics, and it includes the return-to-origin probability (RTOP), return-to-axis probability (RTAP), and the return to plane probability (RTPP), which are all inversely related to the spatial dimensions within the microstructure. In addition, MAP-MRI also calculates a measure of non-Gaussianity (NG), which quantifies the dissimilarity between the full propagator and its Gaussian component and reflects the deviation from DTI’s tensor model. Finally, the propagator anisotropy (PA) provides a higher-order assessment of the FA and quantifies the directional dependence of the diffusion process. Initial studies comparing DTI and MAP-MRI demonstrated that MAP-MRI had much better sensitivity and accuracy in differentiating tissues with distinct structural features or anomalies (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Saleem et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Although DTI is the most prevalent dMRI framework, MAP-MRI has been gaining interest within the neuroimaging community as it provides complementary microstructural information, and has recently been used to aid in the evaluation of conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), stroke (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Brusini et al., 2016</xref>), Parkinson’s Disease (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 2020</xref>), glioma (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), and migraines (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Planchuelo-Gómez et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, in a cohort of over 15000 participants drawn from the UK Biobank spanning the age range between 45 and 80 years, Lawrence and colleagues have shown significant associations between diffusion MRI parameters, among them, the RTPP, RTOP, and RTAP, and age in various WM structures (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2021</xref>). These associations appeared to exhibit near-quadratic trends, likely reflecting aspects of brain maturation and degeneration. However, the restricted age range of the cohort precluded a firm confirmation of these quadratic trends. In addition, restricting the analysis to WM structures provided relatively limited information about the sensitivity of the MAP parameters to the spatial variation across brain structures. Building on this seminal work, in the current study we evaluated age-related effects independently from sex-related effects of MAP parameters in a cohort of 58 participants spanning a wider age range comprised between 21 and 83 years and across several cerebral white and gray matter structures. We also extended our analysis to evaluate these associations in derived NG and PA indices. We hypothesize that both of these previously unexplored MAP-MRI parameters have the potential to capture age-related changes in different ways: the PA is a more comprehensive measure of diffusion anisotropy and can be viewed as a generalized version of the FA, which has already been shown to be a strong age predictor (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Schilling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Storsve et al., 2016</xref>). The NG on the other hand can be thought of as a comprehensive measure of microscopic variations in tissue diffusivities and anisotropies and reflects microstructural heterogeneity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2016</xref>), which we expect to increase with age due to cellular degradation. Our goal is to explore further the age-related sensitivity of these advanced MRI indices of cerebral microstructure and to provide complementary insights into brain maturation and degeneration in a cohort of well-characterized adults.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1.</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P6">Participants were drawn from two ongoing healthy aging cohorts of the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Established in 1958, the BLSA enrolls community-dwelling adults with no major chronic conditions or functional impairments at enrollment. The GESTALT study is also a study of healthy volunteers, initiated in 2015 and funded and conducted by the NIA IRP. The goal of the BLSA and GESTALT studies is to evaluate multiple biomarkers related to aging. We note that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these two studies are essentially identical. Participants underwent testing at the NIA’s clinical research unit and were excluded if they had metallic implants, neurologic, or significant medical disorders. In addition, all participants underwent a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The final cohort consisted of 58 cognitively unimpaired volunteers (mean ± standard deviation MMSE = 29.2 ± 1.0) ranging in age from 21 to 83 years (45.4 ± 18.3 years), including 31 men (42.9 ± 17.5 years) and 27 women (48.3 ± 19.1 years).

Here, the age groups were defined to incorporate a similar sample size in each group, that is, ~10 participants. It is readily seen that derived DTI maps exhibit tissue contrast between different brain substructures as well as across age groups. To illustrate the quadratic nature of the relative age-related microstructural differences, a percent change map between the 33–42 years and 67–84 years groups was computed for each DTI metric by subtracting the former from the latter and dividing by the maximal value (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, last column). Visual inspection of these difference maps indicates that although most regions show lower values of FA at older age, some regions, such as the SCR, exhibit higher values with age. In contrast, all diffusivity maps (AD, RD, and MD) exhibit homogeneous regional higher values with age and across most brain regions.</p><p id="P14">Similarly, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows a representative slice from averaged derived MAP parameter maps of participants within the 6 defined age groups. Visual inspection of the parameter maps and their corresponding percent change images suggests a more heterogeneous spatial pattern of age-related differences, compared with the DTI maps (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, NG exhibited the largest degrees of spatial variability and overall magnitude of difference with age. Similar spatial patterns, although with a lesser magnitude, were observed for PA. A comparison of the PA maps, shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, with the FA maps, shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, points to a substantial difference between the two diffusion anisotropy measures, including the magnitude of age-related alterations, as well as in their regional extent and patterns. Lastly, although more spatially homogeneous as a function of age than the NG and PA, the zero-displacement probabilities (RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP) indicated, overall, lower values with age in most brain regions; this can be interpreted as an increase in the microstructural length scale. While the zero-displacement probabilities contain similar information as the diffusivities and are better suited to describe cerebral tissue with complex microstructure and architecture, the NG and PA provide complementary information that cannot be probed using DTI.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>3.2.</label><title>Brain-wide and regional values as a function of age</title><p id="P15">At the full WM and GM levels, we observed a dominant global pattern of age-related difference in DTI and MAP-MRI parameters; however, a deviation from this global pattern was observed at the ROI level. Specifically, at the full WM and GM levels, age-related differences resulted in lower FA or higher AD, RD, and MD, along with lower NG, RTAP, RTOP, and RTPP with age (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While the quadratic relation with age of all diffusion indices was evident, the rates of maturation or degeneration were different, leading to an age of minimal values for AD, RD and MD in WM/GM of 50.2/28.3, 32.0/28.5, and 38.5/28.4 years, respectively, and an age of maximal values of FA, NG, PA, RTAP, RTOP, and RTPP of 2.4/37.8, 65.2/77.5, 35.5/54.6, 32.5/33.8, 39.3/35.0, and 44.6/29.2 years, respectively. However, this quadratic association was less pronounced with the FA and NG (and non-significant for AD and PA) compared with the aforementioned diffusion indices, likely reflecting the spatially heterogeneous patterns of the microstructure captured by these metrics; this initial observation motivated our ROI-based analysis.</p><p id="P16">At the ROI level, all dMRI indices exhibited differential associations with respect to age across the 36 ROIs investigated. First examining the DTI maps in WM, the diffusivity metrics, namely, AD, RD, and MD, exhibited significant quadratic, U-shaped, associations with age in most WM ROIs, while the FA exhibited statistically significant inverted U-shaped regional associations with age in most WM ROIs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Similar trends were observed in GM, however, with a much more limited number of ROIs reaching statistical significance of the effect of age (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed, only 8 out of 18 GM ROIs showed a significant correlation between FA and age, compared with 16, 15 or 16 ROIs observed with AD, RD or MD, respectively.</p><p id="P17">Examination of the MAP parameters reveals more nuanced microstructural regional patterns, compared with DTI. In WM, the NG exhibited a positive and significant association with age in all ROIs, with the exception of the For, Tap, and SS, which showed negative associations with age (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, not all positive NG age-related differences were associated with a U-shape quadratic trend. Specifically, in the SCR, EC, SLF, SFOF, UF, and ACR, the rate of change from young to adult (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">age</italic></sub>) was positive, while the quadratic association had an inverted U-shape, indicating that NG in these ROIs increases over time, followed by a decline with advanced age, albeit at a slow maturation rate. The PA in WM also exhibited heterogenous age-related differences in which significantly lower values of PA with age were found in the GCC, BCC, For, Tap and ST, while significantly higher values were observed in the ALIC, EC, UF, and SCP. The zero-displacement probabilities, namely, RTAP, RTOP and RTPP, showed quadratic inverted U-shaped associations with age in most WM ROIs. In GM, however, the NG metric exhibited mixed trends with either positive or negative age associations. The associations of NG with age in the GM ROIs were all statistically significant (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). For PA, the regional associations with age were all significant, and interestingly, were consistent and followed the regional patterns of the NG in GM. This robust association should be compared with the DTI-derived anisotropy metric, FA, which had a significant correlation with age in only 44% of the GM ROIs. Further, all of the zero-displacement probability parameters exhibited quadratic, inverted U-shaped, associations with age, with patterns similar to those seen in the WM ROIs.</p><p id="P18">To examine whether MAP-MRI better captures age-related effects, we compared the regression coefficients from the MAP and DTI indices in all ROIs by computing the Steiger’s Z score (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Steiger, 1980</xref>) between all pairs of MAP-DTI metrics. The test establishes whether and which MAP parameters are more suitable than DTI parameters in characterizing age-related differences. The results of all pairwise tests for all ROIs were separated according to WM and GM, and are graphically summarized in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. While in WM MAP shows superiority with respect to DTI in very few instances, the advantage of MAP over DTI becomes evident in GM. These results support the notion that in GM, MAP overwhelmingly better captures age-related effects than DTI.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>3.3.</label><title>Spatial patterns of age-related difference</title><p id="P19">To visualize the spatial distribution of the microstructural differences with age in the brain, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figs. 9</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> show the 36 ROIs color-coded with <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">age</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9" display="inline"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of DTI- or MAP-derived parameters, respectively.

Interestingly, all of those cortical GM ROIs were located in the occipital lobe.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">In this cross-sectional study we show that the diffusion propagator metrics computed using the MAP-MRI framework are sensitive markers of age-associated micro- and meso-structural tissue alterations, and allow a novel characterization of microstructural differences in cerebral tissue with age that cannot be achieved using conventional dMRI measures. Further, in addition to examining previously studied parameters derived from DTI, namely, FA, AD, RD, and MD, and from MAP-MRI, namely, RTAP, RTOP, and RTPP, and limiting the investigation to WM, this work provides the first investigation of the NG and PA parameters as a function of age across brain structures in both white and gray matter. These two indices, especially the NG, exhibited a strong association with age in white and gray matter, which sheds light on a potential biological interpretation of previously and currently observed dMRI trends related to brain maturation and degeneration during normative aging.</p><p id="P23">This study found regional variations in the magnitude of age-related cerebral microstructural differences, visualized in <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figs. 10</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. We report that the diffusivity, NG, and PA captured difference in posterior cortical microstructure, and exhibited the largest quadratic age effect (e.g., lower values with age in the occipital lobe: LOC, OP, and CUC). Interestingly, these occipital reductions in NG were found in conjunction with increases in the frontal lobes, in particular in the FMC. This observation is a novel dMRI finding consistent with the posterior-anterior shift in aging paradigm (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2008</xref>), in which age-related reduction in occipital activity coupled with increased frontal activity is predicted (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Madden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Salami et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we observed that the WM tracts with regional variations pattern involved most of the association fibers, which exhibited the largest quadratic age effect (i.e., higher diffusivity, and lower FA, zero-displacement indices, NG and PA with age). These findings have been observed in other reports across the older adult lifespan (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Merenstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Tseng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), and can be attributed to the abundance of thin fibers with thinner myelin sheaths in the association tracts (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Liewald et al., 2014</xref>), which mature later in life, and are more vulnerable to aging effect than thick fibers (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Because of its microstructural complexity and diversity, GM presents challenges in interpreting dMRI data. Both DTI and more advanced biophysical diffusion models provide a very partial accounting of diffusion behavior in GM (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Jespersen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lampinen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">McKinnon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Novikov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Veraart et al., 2019</xref>), and therefore most brain maturation dMRI studies have chosen to focus on WM to date. On the other hand, our results showed that the MAP-MRI framework is uniquely capable of mapping age-related microstructural changes in GM (in addition to WM), and that age-related effects are overwhelmingly better captured compared with DTI (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). While the diffusivity indices showed significant increases with age in GM, we observed that the FA has a much weaker association with age in GM, with only 8 out of the 18 GM ROIs reaching statistical significance. Further illustrating DTI’s ambiguity is the fact that despite being microstructurally and architecturally different, all DTI metrics follow similar age-related patterns in WM, cortical GM, and subcortical GM regions. On the other hand, MAP-derived PA and NG provide a more nuanced description of GM microstructure. As a measure of tissue anisotropy, the PA is more descriptive than the FA in GM (17 out of 18 GM ROIs being significant). We observed that in GM the age-related changes of PA and NG exhibited different spatial patterns compared to other microstructural parameters. In addition, while the FA only decreased with age in GM, the PA and FA had opposite trends in 5 out of 18 ROIs we examined, with PA increasing and FA decreasing.</p><p id="P25">To interpret these results, we note that the PA provides a higher-order assessment of the FA and quantifies the directional dependence of the diffusion process (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Özarslan et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the opposite trends of PA and FA in GM reflect an increased glial concentration, which would lead to a reduction in the net diffusivity of the isotropic diffusion component, thus elevating the net contribution of anisotropic processes (radial and tangential) to the overall voxel anisotropy. For FA, these radial and tangential contributions cancel, resulting in a low value. Meanwhile, if the relative contribution of isotropic diffusion to the net voxel signal is reduced with respect to the radial and tangential components, the PA could increase. An additional driver of the FA-PA discrepancy could be reduced neuronal projections across cortical layers, which would diminish radial diffusion processes, and in turn lower the FA, but, in certain situations increase the PA because of anisotropic water diffusion in tangentially oriented cell processes. However, further comprehensive studies with a wider age range and larger b-values along with histological assessments are required to derive firm conclusions on the underlying biological aspects of the processes observed here.</p><p id="P26">In WM, the association of DTI-derived diffusivities and MAP-derived zero displacement probabilities with age were consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Inano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Kiely et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Westlye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2014</xref>), which suggest an increase in apparent microscopic water mobility with age. Taken together, these findings by themselves do not provide a clear understanding of the underpinning of age-related tissue and cell-level changes due to the multitude of microstructural processes involved. The FA in WM, which can be associated with axon orientational coherence and size, and overall fiber integrity (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996</xref>), showed an overall age-dependent decrease consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Pines et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, these WM alterations are hard to interpret because of their inherent non-specificity discussed above. Providing a more comprehensive microstructural picture in WM, we observed decreases in MAP-derived PA along with elevated NG with age (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>), which point to an increase in water population with little anisotropy but larger mean diffusivity than that of normal WM. Taking into account that NG is often described as a measure of diffusion heterogeneity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Özarslan et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesize that these findings support the microstructural scenario of axonal degradation with age, leading to increased extracellular volume, in which water diffuses almost freely with little anisotropy but with a diffusivity similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p><p id="P27">While we only provided direct comparisons to DTI, framing the age-related MAP-MRI differences within the broader context of higher-order dMRI methods, such as DKI and biophysical models (e.g., NODDI), is important for understanding and interpreting our results. Similarly to DTI, DKI can be used appropriately as a signal representation only at sufficiently low b-values (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Novikov et al., 2018</xref>). Diffusional kurtosis, which is often interpreted as non-Gaussianity, is computed using only the first four components of the diffusion propagator, while MAP-based NG is derived from the full propagator. The difference between the two is therefore at the higher order coefficients that contain richer microstructural information (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Özarslan et al., 2013</xref>). Although DKI has been shown to enhance the sensitivity to age-related patterns in WM compared with DTI (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Coutu et al., 2014</xref>), kurtosis indices follow the same age associations as the DTI-derived diffusivities (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Pines et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Taha et al., 2022</xref>), implying that these parameters carry similar information. A key finding of our current study is that MAP-derived NG does not reduce but rather increases with age in most WM ROIs, exhibiting an opposing trend with respect to DKI maps. We can therefore conclude that MAP-derived NG and kurtosis parameters contain different microstructural information. Although biophysical models such as NODDI provide a straightforward interpretation of the dMRI signal and can even be related to histological findings (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Grussu et al., 2017</xref>), these are restricted to use within healthy WM with high degree of orientation coherence (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lampinen et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, MAP-MRI can be applied to any type of brain tissue, and its microstructural sensitivity and specificity were recently validated histologically in subcortical gray and white matter regions (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Saleem et al., 2021</xref>), as well as in cortical gray matter (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P28">This study has several limitations. First, the results of this cross-sectional study may be affected by the heterogeneity within the cohort of participants, including differences in lifestyle, socio-economic status, nutrition, health/medication, etc. A longitudinal study design would be able to validate the current cross-sectional trends with individual subject trajectories. An additional challenge in imaging studies comparing participants with possibly different macrostructural brain characteristics is that different amounts of warping to standard space are needed. Moreover, contamination due to partial volume effects may affect the quantitation of the MAP/DTI-derived microstructural parameters, especially in small brain structures. To mitigate this potential confound, all ROIs were eroded and underwent careful visual inspection. Nevertheless, some partial volume effects could have persisted. In addition, age-related tissue atrophy could lead to non-optimal image registration and potentially bias the estimated microstructural parameters for specific age groups. Another limitation of our data set was the relatively small cohort, which did not include very young participants (<italic toggle="yes">&lt;</italic>20 years of age). The exclusion of younger participants may have influenced the quantification of the age trends (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Fjell et al., 2010</xref>) as well as the interpretation of the possible asymmetrical trends observed between the maturation and degeneration phases (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the dMRI data in our study was acquired with a maximal b-value of 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. While providing good SNR, this relatively low diffusion sensitization also presents a limitation in our ability to measure very subtle features of the underlying diffusion propagators. Accordingly, we measured the propagators using 22 coefficients corresponding to the most significant basis functions in a MAP-MRI series expansion truncated at order 4 (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Özarslan et al., 2013</xref>). Encoding up to higher b-values of 6000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2021</xref>) would have allowed including terms up to order 6, which was found to be optimal in clinical applications (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Future studies should investigate and characterize microscopic changes to the shape, size, and geometry of cerebral tissue across the lifespan. While decoupling size and spatial orientation is not possible using the conventional linear (i.e., single) diffusion encoding scheme, multiple diffusion encoding (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Topgaard, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Westin et al., 2016</xref>), for example, planar or spherical (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2019</xref>), should be used to investigate these effects, along with improving spatial resolution (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Saleem et al., 2021</xref>) and combining relaxation and diffusion encoding simultaneously (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Avram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Basser, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Slator et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P29">By applying the mean apparent diffusion propagator (MAP) model to dMRI data, this paper has provided a thorough characterization of regional heterogeneity of age-related differences in a healthy cross-sectional cohort. We have shown that the PA and NG, which have never been explored to study aging, are substantially more sensitive to age-related changes in GM than DTI indices. Providing a microstructural glance into GM, the distinct age-related patterns of the PA seemingly indicate fewer neuronal projections across cortical layers, along with an increased glial concentration. In WM, the age-related decreases in PA with simultaneous increases in NG are likely to reflect axonal degradation, leading to a relative rise in extracellular volume. Results from this study may be useful in understanding age-related microstructural changes, and in encouraging the broader use of MAP-MRI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>MMC1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="NIHMS1865115-supplement-MMC1.pdf" id="d64e928" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P30">This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.

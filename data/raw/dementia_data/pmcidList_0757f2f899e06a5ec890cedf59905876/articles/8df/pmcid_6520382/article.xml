It is therefore of chief importance that their recognition system readily identifies the most relevant properties of food by drawing on semantic memory. One of the most relevant properties to be considered is the level of processing impressed by humans on food. We hypothesized that recognition of raw food capitalizes on sensory properties and that of transformed food on functional properties, consistently with the hypothesis of a sensory-functional organization of semantic knowledge. To test this hypothesis, patients with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, and healthy controls performed lexical-semantic tasks with food (raw and transformed) and non-food (living and nonliving) stimuli. Correlations between task performance and local grey matter concentration (VBM) and white matter fractional anisotropy (TBSS) led to two main findings. First, recognition of raw food and living things implicated occipital cortices, typically involved in processing sensory information and, second, recognition of processed food and nonliving things implicated the middle temporal gyrus and surrounding white matter tracts, regions that have been associated with functional properties. In conclusion, the present study confirms and extends the hypothesis of a sensory and a functional organization of semantic knowledge.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Language</kwd><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fondazione BENEFICENTIA - &amp;quot;Ricerca sulla riabilitazione dei disturbi alimentari (BEN 2014/140)&amp;quot; G92I15000050007 Contributo Fondo Trieste - Commissariato del Governo (Assegnazione straordinaria anno 2013) progetto &amp;quot;Prevenzione delle conseguenze dell&amp;apos;invecchiamento e il contributo delle neuroscienze cognitive&amp;quot; - G92I14000190005 &amp;quot;NuAged: Nutrizione e cognizione nell&amp;apos;anziano&amp;quot;, Comune di Trieste, Contributo anno 2017 (deliberazione giuntale n. 639 dd 07/12/2017).

Over the years, scholars have focused on defining the organizing principles of semantic knowledge in the brain, and proposed different models of semantic memory. The neuropsychological observations of patients with a disproportionate impairment at recognizing items from a particular category or domain of knowledge while sparing others imposed a great impulse on the field. For instance, the double dissociation in recognizing living things and nonliving things has been taken by Warrington, Shallice, and colleagues as evidence that semantic knowledge is likely to be organized in subsystems, coding sensory properties and functional properties respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to the sensory-functional hypothesis (SFH), damage to the sensory subsystem would impair recognition of living things, on the ground that for recognizing these items, the integrity of their sensory properties such as the colour, the shape, the texture is necessary; likewise, damage to the functional subsystem would impair recognition of nonliving things, because for recognizing these items their functional properties (how to manipulate them, what they can be used for) need to be preserved.</p><p id="Par3">However, patients’ performance might breakdown in a finer grain. This is the case, for instance, of patient E.W. who had a selective deficit at naming animals but could still recognize other living categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To accommodate for such cases, Caramazza and collaborators suggested that the organization of our knowledge in the brain has been shaped by evolutionary pressure (Distributed Domain Specific Hypothesis, DDSH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, allowing a faster recognition of items that are more relevant for our survival: conspecifics, animals, plants and, perhaps, tools. In their view, all the properties of the items belonging to a specific category are stored together in the brain; therefore, brain damage might end up affecting more modalities, irrespective of whether the items are living or nonliving.</p><p id="Par4">However, recent imaging and computational studies provided further evidence in support of the anatomical segregation of living things and non-living things: (see e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>): recognition of the living things tends to occur in visual regions and that of utensils in the posterior parietal regions, while semantic knowledge depends upon the integrity of the temporal lobe (see the ‘spoke-and-hub’ model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, we exploit food as a stimulus to test these different hypotheses about object recognition (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). In particular, we focused on the level of food transformation whereby natural, unprocessed food, such as apples or lettuce, can be distinguished from transformed food that has been manufactured, such as pizza or a hamburger. The importance of food transformation has been extensively addressed by Richard Wrangham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, he argued that food transformation procedures are ubiquitous and have contributed toward the evolution of our species by providing a greater net energetic gain. Moreover, cooking food reduces the risk of ingesting poisonous substances and makes it more palatable. The relevance of the level of transformation in food recognition has recently been supported by two electrophysiological studies with healthy participants. First, evidence that the human brain can discriminate whether a food is natural or transformed at around 120 milliseconds has recently been provided (see Coricelli <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., under review). Second, the N400, that is a measure of semantic incongruency, was found to be greater for trials pairing transformed food images with sentences describing sensory properties, and natural food images with sentences describing functional properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These results support the hypothesis, recently put forward and extending the SFH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, that recognition of natural food and living things is alike, as it relies more efficiently on sensory properties, whereas recognition of transformed foods relies more efficiently on functional properties, as it happens for recognition of artefacts. The aim of our study was therefore to test this hypothesis. Specifically, we expected knowledge about living things and natural food to be represented in the lateral occipital cortex (LO) and the fusiform gyrus (FG), as well as in sensory processing areas (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>), and knowledge about nonliving things and transformed food, in regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and superior temporal gyrus (STG), previously associated to knowledge of tools (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). This organization should also be mirrored in the involvement of white matter tracts. If these hypotheses were confirmed, our findings would strongly support the view that semantic memory is organized, at least partially, in sensory/functional subsystems.</p><p id="Par6">In order to test these hypotheses, in the present study we assessed the semantic knowledge about food (natural and transformed) and non-food (living and nonliving things) in healthy participants and in patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD). All these different neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by extensive damage to the temporal lobe that has reliably been associated with semantic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Participants’ accuracy on tests tapping semantic knowledge about food and non-food items was correlated with the local grey matter concentration and the water diffusion of the white matter tracts (fractional anisotropy, FA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p id="Par7">Behavioral analyses are reported in the Supplemental material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Anatomical analyses</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>VBM and TBSS</title><p id="Par8">Association between gray matter and recognition of natural food, transformed food, living things, nonliving things: The tests (naming, word-picture matching, categorization) we devised aimed at tapping the participants’ semantic knowledge about natural food, transformed food, living things, and non-living things.

This was achieved by testing whether natural food and living things, on the one hand, and transformed food and nonliving things, on the other, share common neural substrates by exploring whether these categories have overlapping voxels. The “sensory subsystem” will, therefore, correspond to the regions shared by natural food and living things, and the “functional subsystem” will correspond to the regions shared by transformed food and non-living things.

Our results across different tasks are in accordance with the SFH, with correlations being found between atrophy of ‘sensory’ regions and reduced ability to recognize natural food and living things, on the one hand, and between atrophy of ‘functional’ regions and reduced ability to recognize transformed food and nonliving things, on the other. In the following, we will explain this pattern of VBM, TBSS and DTI tractography results.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Natural food and living things: the “Sensory Knowledge”</title><p id="Par19">One of the main results that emerged from the VBM analysis is that the reduced ability to recognize natural food mainly correlates with atrophy in sensory regions of the cortex such as LOC, cerebellum and the ITC, which have been repeatedly found associated to sensory processing (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). The anterior corpus callosum (CC) turned out to be also involved in natural food recognition based on TBSS results. This tract is implicated in semantic processing and in sensory-motor tasks (for a review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). We argue that the involvement of this tract might depend on natural food still needing to be prepared, as also suggested by a recent EEG study (Coricelli <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., under review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). In this latter study with healthy individuals, a peak in the waveform was observed as early as 130 ms from visual onset of natural food stimuli in the premotor cortex. This region not only is a primary sensory area, but is also the site of the somatic motor and sensory homunculus (Penfield &amp; Boldrey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). Recently Catani<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> revised Penfield’s view and showed that in this brain region there are co-localization of sensory maps representing different body parts, rather than a full segregation and critically between the hand region and mouth region. This might be due to the fact that hand-to-mouth movements are necessary to bring food to the mouth, and this is more likely to be associated with natural foods. Indeed, natural food is generally perceived as less readily edible than transformed food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Results from the VBM conjunction analysis, exploring recognition of both natural food and living things in the experimental tasks, confirm that the lexical-semantic information common to these stimuli is represented in sensory regions (LO, cerebellum, bilateral FG and ITC). The TBSS conjunction analysis investigating lexical-semantic processes of both natural food and living things, showed an involvement, among other tracts, of the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, that connects the anterior temporal lobe with the OFC. This result, supported by DTI tractography analyses, highlights the involvement of this higher order region, involved in assigning a behavioural value to a stimulus (e.g., a plant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Transformed food and nonliving things: the “Functional Knowledge”</title><p id="Par21">On the other hand, recognition of transformed food is mainly affected by atrophy in functional associated regions (e.g., left pMTG, AG, and STG among the others, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>), as well as regions associated with processing images of palatable or highly caloric foods (e.g. insular cortex, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). The TBSS highlighted the involvement of the right cingulum (a bilateral correlation was observed but did not survive FWE correction), a tract that has been associated with high calorie food images processing (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>), and the corpus callosum, which is involved in motor function (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>), in ideomotor apraxia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as well as in transfer of semantic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Information about nonliving entities and transformed foods together (conjunction analysis) is coded in functional related regions (IFG, STG, MTG, posterior parietal cortex). Moreover, the sensory-functional matching task showed that performance in trials involving functional words and transformed food correlated with pMTG and STG, thus supporting to the hypothesis that transformed food shares features with utensils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, performance on these trials also correlated with atrophy of the PHG (bilaterally) and right ITC, regions previously associated with high calorie food processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This latter result additionally suggests that the energetic content might be a relevant functional property in transformed food recognition. The TBSS conjunction analysis revealed that the left arcuate posterior segment and the right cingulum correlate with the recognition of transformed food and nonliving things together, across different tasks. In addition, we found a consistent involvement of the IL fasciculus with TBSS analyses, This white matter tract encompasses the regions we found involved in functional knowledge with the VBM analysis (MTG, STG).</p><p id="Par22">Recognition of nonliving things correlates with atrophy of the precuneus cortex, previously associated with knowing about tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and of the STG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Consistently, the TBSS highlighted the involvement of the corticospinal tract bilaterally, the corpus callosum (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>), and the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, involved in language processing (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) and encompassing the aforementioned MTG and STG.</p><p id="Par23">The present findings strongly support the initial hypotheses that food breaks down in natural and transformed foods, and that this distinction depends upon a sensory/functional organization of semantic memory. Interestingly, behavioural results of the sensory-functional task, that was intentionally designed to test the sensory-functional hypothesis using food as a test category, show that bvFTD and PPA patients, but not Alzheimer’s disease patients, performed better in trials where sensory words are paired with natural food, probably due to the greater impairment at correctly categorizing natural food in the latter group (see S6 for details). Moreover, these results are in line with recent studies, supporting the relevance of the natural/transformed food distinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In particular support of the hypothesis that the natural/transformed distinction relies on sensory/functional properties, a recent ERP study, found that, in normal weight individuals, the N400 component, usually modulated by semantic or syntactic incongruency, was larger for sensory primes paired with transformed foods and functional primes paired with natural foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, it seems that the brain is able to track the difference between natural and transformed food as early as around 130 ms (Coricelli <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., under review).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>A possible ‘food network’</title><p id="Par24">Our findings allow us also to identify several brain regions that appear to be strongly involved in semantic knowledge about food. Specifically, patients’ performance with food correlates with OFC, ITC - especially the posterior fusiform cortex – and LOC and the white matter tracts connecting these regions, such as the IFOF, connecting occipital areas with the OFC. One could speculate that all these regions (OFC, ITC, LO) may together constitute a network responsible, together with the temporal lobes, of processing information concerning food and, by assigning a value to the stimulus (OFC, e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>), to plan how to act upon it (see for instance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>). In fact, the IFOF puts temporal and frontal regions in communication. This result suggests that food may overall be processed as an extremely salient stimulus thanks to both sensory and functional properties.</p><p id="Par25">Another interesting result concerns transformed food. Indeed, behaviorally, transformed food was overall named significantly better than natural food, consistently with other studies showing an advantage for this category<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Another interesting result is that only bvFTD patients named food significantly better than non-food and that their performance, particularly with transformed food, significantly correlates with calorie content (see Supplementary information <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>). This has been not observed with any of the other groups. This result is interesting and deserves to be further investigated since bvFTD is known to cause several eating abnormalities, among which a strong preference for foods that are palatable and high in calorie content (for a review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Towards a comprehensive model of semantic memory</title><p id="Par26">Taken together, our results highlighted a set of cortical regions and white matter tracts involved in semantic processing, and add evidence on current models of semantic memory. They confirm and extend the SFH theory, since they show a set of regions (e.g. bilateral OFC, FG), connected by white matter tracts (e.g. the IFOF), that are associated with sensory knowledge, and a set of cortical regions (IFG, STG, MTG, posterior parietal cortex), connected by white matter tracts (e.g. the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), associated with functional knowledge.</p><p id="Par27">The existence of these sets of regions suggests that objects may be primarily recognized based on properties (e.g., visual, olfactory, gustatory vs. functional, motor) that are more diagnostic for their recognition and that these properties are likely to be organized in two main subsystems (sensory and functional). We speculate that the sensory vs. functional initial information is eventually integrated in the ventral ATL, bilaterally, that has been proposed to be pan-modal hub (see for instance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). Consistently with this view, in our study, the vATLs emerged only when considering the semantic performance overall. This result is supported both behaviourally and anatomically. PPA patients do not show any category-specificity in their semantic deficit: this suggests that the ATLs, strongly and almost selectively damaged in these patients, are organized in an a-modal structure. This is supported also by the massive involvement, across categories, of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, especially on the left side. This white matter tract has been suggested to connect ventral aspects of the ATL with other temporal and dorsoparietal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In our view, our results from both TBSS and VBM suggest that ATLs may be critical in integrating semantic information. Our results are also in line with a recent model emphasizing the role of the ATLs as a semantic panmodal hub, as the C<sup>3</sup> model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> according to which visual features are critical for recognizing living things, and vATLs represent cross-modal hubs communicating with modality-specific spokes (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). Our results converge with the view that ATLs integrate semantic information.</p><p id="Par28">In conclusion, our results strongly support a sensory-functional organization of semantic knowledge, with information concerning food breaking down in natural and transformed and being stored in sensory versus functional brain regions, respectively, rather than in a domain-specific fashion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par29">Fifty-eight right-handed participants took part in the study: ten bvFTD patients (five females), eleven PPA patients (four females), eleven Alzheimer’s disease patients (six females), and twenty-six healthy controls (sixteen females).

The four blocks were divided in: natural food and living things; natural food and nonliving things; transformed food and living things; transformed food and nonliving things. This configuration of trials allows assessing whether there is an impairment in a specific category (same trials), but also whether for participants it is more difficult to judge natural foods as different from living things rather than from nonliving things, or transformed foods as different from nonliving things rather than from living things.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Task 4–Sensory/functional matching task</title><p id="Par34">This task was specifically designed to test whether pairing a word representing a sensory property with a natural food, and pairing a word describing a functional property with transformed food (congruent trials) would improve accuracy compared to trials in which natural food and transformed food were paired with functional and sensory properties, respectively (incongruent trials). Specifically, participants were asked to decide whether the word paired with the image was true or false with respect to that image (e.g. lasagne – lunch; almonds – hard). In addition, for each item we presented two filler trials, in which incorrect congruent and incongruent pairings (e.g. cauliflower – sweet, lasagne – breakfast) were presented, in order to avoid participants to respond always in the same manner to the question. Such trials were not considered for the behavioural analyses. The task (56 trials) consisted in two blocks, one pairing words describing sensory features (e.g. ‘sweet’) and the second block pairing words describing functional features (e.g. ‘lunch’) with either natural or transformed foods.

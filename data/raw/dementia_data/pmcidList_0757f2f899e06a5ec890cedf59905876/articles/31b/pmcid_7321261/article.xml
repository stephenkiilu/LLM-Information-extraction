However, it is unclear how these parameters reflect changes in structural brain networks of patients with AD or MCI. In this study, our previously proposed persistent features and various traditional graph-theoretical measures are used to quantify the topological property of white matter (WM) network in 150 subjects with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

The decreased network integration and increased network segregation are presented in AD and MCI. Moreover, the persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability and robustness than traditional graph-theoretic measures, suggesting that they represent a more sensitive approach to detect altered brain structures and to better understand AD symptomology at the network level.

Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Clinical manifestations are mainly memory dysfunction and cognitive decline. As a transitional stage between normal aging and AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases the risk of developing dementia. Understanding the physiological deterioration caused by AD and MCI provides an opportunity to develop future drugs and predict AD onset [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The human brain is interconnected by a large number of neurons through synapses, forming a highly complex network system that realizes various intelligent behaviors of human beings. Within these neural networks, even minor mutations can cause serious diseases [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the past several years, some literatures [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have begun to explore the treatment of AD and develop drugs from the perspective of structural brain network reconstruction and neuronal circuit repair [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many postmortem histological and in-vivo imaging studies indicate widespread white matter (WM) changes in patients with MCI and AD [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. WM brain network research provides a chance to understand how abnormal structural connections can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits in these patients.</p><p>Graph theory [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has become an important tool for studying the progression of AD which is characterized by network disruptions that seem to reflect the spread of pathological changes in the brain [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some neurobiologically meaningful topological features of graph theory have been used to measure and evaluate the integration and segregation of the brain network, including small-world attributes, hubs, modularity, etc. [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By comparing the abnormal changes in these topological properties, the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD have been revealed to a certain extent, such as a loss of small-worldness and a redistribution of hubs [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although graph theory can find quantitative biomarkers of brain disease, it is necessary to threshold the brain network in advance [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which will alter inferred network topologies and thus produces inconsistent results based on different thresholds [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, there are no widely accepted criteria for choosing thresholds.</p><p>As a mathematical tool in algebraic topology, persistent homology [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] has been developed for the analysis of topological data, including brain networks. It establishes a multiscale brain network over all possible thresholds by graph filtration [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the brain networks at each scale are nested with each other, which not only provides an important framework for the analysis of the evolution of the characteristics of the brain network, but also identifies the persistent and robust structures from noise during network dynamics. Unlike the brain network studies on spatiotemporal dynamics [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it only considers the intrinsic dynamics of network nodes without time delays. Using a typical persistent feature, Betti number plot (BNP) [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], some have found abnormal functional brain networks in the study of epilepsy [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and others have reported disrupted structural brain networks in maltreated children [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our prior study [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we proposed an integrated persistent feature (IPF) based on BNP and found that it has robust statistical capability in the study of functional brain network of AD and MCI in multiple brain atlases of different sizes. Although some persistent homology-based measures have been proposed to characterize the global organization of brain network, they have never been applied to measure the AD-related structural brain networks so far.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the integration and segregation of the WM brain connectome. We hypothesize that the alterations of AD progression could be understood through measuring the global structural network, and the persistent homology-based methods may provide additional insights into AD symptomology beyond studies of graph theory. We hope this study could provide a novel approach to potentially track efficacy of drug treatment for Alzheimer’s disease in terms of medical practice. With the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 40 AD, 77 MCI and 33 normal controls (NC), we set out to test this hypothesis by computing some standard graph-theoretic measures and our suggested persistent features for each subject’s WM network and then comparing their statistical differences across the three groups to reveal AD symptomology at the network level to some extent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-02472"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-25-02472"><title>2.1. Demographic Information</title><p>There were 150 individuals aged from 56 to 90 participated in this study from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the number of NC was less than the number of patients in DTI dataset, we used all 33 NC subjects and matched them to 77 MCI and 40 AD patients by gender, age, and education (<xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, there were no significant differences in gender, age, and education across three groups using nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test [<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while there were significant difference in clinical dementia rating (CDR) global scores [<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Diagnostic classification was made by ADNI investigators using established criteria [<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, the displacement at any direction of the head movement in all the studied images was less than 1 mm, and the rotation at any angle was less than 1°.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-25-02472"><title>2.2. WM Brain Network</title><p>Each subject’s original weighted network was constructed based on Desikan–Killiany brain atlas [<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with 68 (DK68) region-of-interests (ROIs), using 1 minus Pearson correlation as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-molecules-25-02472">Section 4.2</xref>. The adjacent matrices of three groups of mean weighted networks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f001">Figure 1</xref>. All edge weights were included and were ranged from 0 to 1.3 in our experiment, although theoretically they can be between 0 and 2. The lower weight represents the stronger association between ROIs. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f001">Figure 1</xref>, there were no significant visual differences between the three groups of original networks. In order to seek their differences, we further constructed multiscale WM networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f002">Figure 2</xref>) from original networks using graph filtration [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] at all possible scales for studying persistent features. We found AD had more segregated connected components (sparser connections) at most filtration points before aggregating to the giant component, comparing to NC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-25-02472"><title>2.3. Network Properties</title><p>After constructing multiscale WM networks, we plotted two persistent features: Betti number <italic toggle="yes">β</italic><sub>0</sub> and IPF over all filtration values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the dynamic plots for the mean networks of AD, MCI, and NC groups. Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f002">Figure 2</xref>, there were more separately connected components in AD than MCI and NC at most filtration values, since the AD curve was above the MCI and NC curves most of the time, indicating a more segregated organization structure in AD.</p><p>The absolute slope of each curve was refined into a network index. We computed all subjects’ IPF and BNP indices and show their box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b where 1, 2, and 3 represent AD, MCI, and NC, respectively. In general, the IPF and BNP indices in AD group were higher than MCI, and much higher than NC. In addition, we computed the traditional network properties based on graph theory to investigate the integration, segregation, centrality, and other characteristics in the brain connectome. Specifically, the characteristic path length (CPL), global efficiency (GE), nodal strength (NS), modularity (Mod), clustering coefficient (CC), and eigenvector centrality (EC) of each subject’s WM network were quantified, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f004">Figure 4</xref>c–h. We saw CPL, Mod, and CC were higher in the patient groups, while GE and NS were lower. However, the difference of EC among three groups was hard to observe.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-25-02472"><title>2.4. Statistical Group Difference Performance</title><p>Using different network indices, the statistical difference of all 150 individual networks across AD, MCI, and NC were obtained in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Our IPF got most significant differences in AD vs. MCI vs. NC (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002), AD vs. NC (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0003), and MCI vs. NC (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.007). It almost got a significant difference between AD and MCI (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.084). Another persistent index BNP also obtained great performance in statistical inference, only slightly weaker than IPF. Furthermore, all network indices detected significant differences between AD/MCI and NC (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), except for EC which didn’t obtain significant difference between MCI and NC. The difference between AD and MCI couldn’t be detected by any graph theoretic measures. In general, our IPF shows better statistical power than another persistent feature BNP, and is much better than traditional graph-based features, CPL, GE, NS, Mod, CC, and EC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-25-02472"><title>2.5. Main Findings</title><p>Our study is the first to assess how persistent homology-based features characterize the abnormal global organization in structural network of AD. We have three main findings in investigating the integration and segregation of AD-related brain networks at the global network level.</p><p>First, we found abnormal integration of global network organization was presented in MCI, especially in AD, comparing to controls. The patient groups showed significantly increased CPL and reduced GE and NS using graph theory. In the brain dynamics by graph filtration based on persistent homology, the BNP and IPF indices of AD were significant different from MCI and NC (AD &gt; MCI &gt; NC), suggesting the altered aggregation pattern in patient groups. This finding is consistent with most of existing studies [<xref rid="B32-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as AD and MCI have less integration typically in whole brain organization.</p><p>Second, we found more highly segregated organization in MCI and AD comparing with NC, providing an evidence of AD as a disconnection syndrome [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The patients demonstrated more separated components (larger Betti number <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) in global network. This study introduces a novel perspective of persistent homology that confirms the increased segregation in AD structural networks.</p><p>At last, it is first time to study structural brain network of AD using persistent homology-based methods which achieved stronger power in statistical inference among three groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than standard graph-theoretic measures. In our previous AD-related brain network studies on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we also exhibited the superiority of persistent homology comparing to graph theory. Taken together, persistent homology may be a more sensitive mean to detect altered brain structure and understand AD symptomology at the network level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-25-02472"><title>3. Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-molecules-25-02472"><title>3.1. Validation on Various Parcellations</title><p>In general, the network measures are sensitive to the brain parcellation strategies [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In order to evaluate the robustness of our findings, we performed identity experiments on other three parcellation schemes. Specifically, a subcortical parcellation was performed from a manually labeled training dataset [<xref rid="B36-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], including eight subcortical structures (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and ventral) [<xref rid="B37-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] across both hemispheres. We introduced these 16 ROIs into DK68 atlas, yielding an atlas with 84 ROIs (DK84). In addition, the widely-used automated anatomical labeling atlas with 90 regions (AAL90) [<xref rid="B38-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] was severed as the second parcellation, and the last parcellation subdivided each of the regions of DK68 atlas into four sub-regions according to a parcellation division algorithm [<xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], producing an atlas with 272 regions (DK272).</p><p>We then computed all network indices under these three atlases and made statistical inferences on their differences across three groups. The resulting <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values are shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All measures except Mod, CC, and EC detected significant differences (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the two patient groups and the control group in three validated parcellations with increasing number of regions. In addition, GE and NS decreased with AD progression in all parcellation schemes while IPF, BNP, CPL, Mod, and EC increased, as shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Inconsistently, the CC of patient groups decreased in AAL90 atlas, while it presented increasing trends in remaining parcellations. This conflicting result suggests that CC lacks robustness to the characterization of topological deterioration. In contrast, CPL, GE, and NS showed better robustness and sensitivity to the whole-brain parcellation schemes among graph theoretical measures. These results are consistent with existing graph-theoretic findings in [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Among them, FA has usually been applied to define the connection between regions. We validated this physiological parameter and reconstructed WM brain networks. Then, the statistical results of different network indices between groups were obtained. As shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the two persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability than traditional graph-theoretic measures again.</p><p>Moreover, there are various correlation methods to define interregional connectivity. Among them, Pearson correlation is a simple way to study the connection between two related variables, and is often used in the construction of brain networks, especially in the studies based on persistent homology [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, we used 1 minus Pearson correlation to define the edge weight, so that both positive and negative correlations can be taken into account and the lower weight (i.e., the higher association) represents the shorter path length between regions directly. Although some studies [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] including our prior two works [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have applied this approach to connectivity definition, rare research has compared it with other different definition ways, which may yield different results in brain network analysis. For example, in order to consider the non-linearity of the brain data, Spearman correlation may represent a better approach. Then partial correlation computes the complicated relationship between two ROIs while ignores the influence of other ROIs. We validated the two common correlations and used one minus their correlation coefficients to define brain network connectivity. The statistical results are shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, where only our previously proposed IPF obtained significant difference between the two patient groups and the control group in both connectivity definitions. In addition, some studies [<xref rid="B43-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] take the absolute value of Pearson correlation instead of 1 minus Pearson correlation as edge weight. Therefore, we validated our dataset by this method and the resulting group differences are shown in <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. We found that the experimental results produced by these two approaches of Pearson correlation are basically indistinguishable, by comparing <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="molecules-25-02472-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.

Limitations and Future Work</title><p>Despite the promising results obtained by applying our suggested persistent features to detect the abnormal structure in whole brain network organization with DTI, there are three important caveats.</p><p>First, none of network measures has detected significant difference between AD and MCI under all tested parcellations and connectivity definitions in our dataset, although two persistent features IPF and BNP almost got it (both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.1). The clinical symptoms of patients with AD and MCI are so close that sometimes even the clinician can hardly distinguish them. In the future, we may boost the performance of persistent features to discriminate such subtle difference by applying higher dimensional persistent homologies rather than only choosing zeroth persistent homology in this study, because the higher dimensional homology can characterize the more complexed topological structures such as circular holes.</p><p>Then, the absence of a functional MRI evaluation represents a limitation of this study because structural and functional changes in WM are not always simultaneously evident. Therefore, the change in metabolism could not be fully explained by structural WM alteration. It might be caused by functional changes, which are not evaluated in this study. Previously, we have applied persistent features to evaluate the functional changes using functional MRI [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and FDG-PET [<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in our two independent studies. In future, we will integrate structural and functional networks together to investigate the alteration in identical subjects, making the experimental results more interpretable.</p><p>Finally, the absence of a longitudinal DTI evaluation is another limitation of this study. We only investigated cross-sectional DTI in this study. However, the change of the longitudinal persistent feature is more meaningful, especially in tracking AD progression and assessing the effectiveness of drugs. In the future, we will investigate time-related dynamics [<xref rid="B44-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] based on tract lengths and longitudinal DTI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-25-02472"><title>4.

As an example, we have two different MSTs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f006">Figure 6</xref>b from the graph <italic toggle="yes">G</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, and both have the identical weight set [0.1 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.5], thus the maximal graph filtration at five increasing filtration values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 is <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm16"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊂</mml:mo><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊂</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊂</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊂</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f006">Figure 6</xref>c where <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm17"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ℬ</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> represents a subnetwork connected by edges with weights less than <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm18"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the numbers of connected components <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm19"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are 6, 5, 4, 2, and 1. Finally, the Betti number <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm20"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> plot (BNP) over all possible filtration values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02472-f006">Figure 6</xref>d) is regarded as a persistent feature of original network in some studies [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Although the BNP shows how the number of connected component varies over different filtration values, it only quantifies the persistent feature in a given state, and the future required persistence information is ignored. Thus, we introduced an aggregation cost to quantify the total required persistence for completing all subsequent evolutions in a nested filtration graph and proposed a novel Integrated Persistent Feature (IPF) in our prior study [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02472" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The IPF can be understood through the change of total required persistence in the integration process from loose connected components to a fully connected component. In a graph filtration, none of the nodes is connected at the beginning when filtration value λ is zero; the nodes are gradually connected and eventually integrate into one giant component when all nodes are connected. Suppose the total persistence when all components are connected is the target persistence, the total required persistence is getting less with the graph evolution until all components are connected. In this way, the IPF can be thought as the least total required persistence for evolving from current loose connected component to future fully connected component, because the graph filtration is produced by MST in this study. We have previously proven that the IPF plot corresponding to the maximal graph filtration is a monotonically decreasing convergence function.</p><p>In clinical settings, doctors prefer single indices as biomarkers because a single neuroimaging index provides a practical reference for evaluating disease progression and for effective treatments. In this study, we define the absolute slope of IPF plot as a network index (IPF index) by the linear regression analysis. The IPF is getting smaller until all connected components are connected and the IPF is equal to zero, thus the proposed IPF index may be thought as the information diffusion rate or the convergence speed of arriving to a fully connected component. Similarly, we define the absolute slope of BNP curve as BNP index. These two persistent features measure the network topology from the perspective of single persistence and total persistence during the weight dynamics. Since all possible thresholding weights are automatically and completely considered in graph filtration, they have better robustness and sensitivity than graph theoretical measures that usually quantify the network topology at a certain thresholding scale. The persistent features are automatically computed under original weighted network, without artificially specifying any threshold schemes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-molecules-25-02472"><title>4.4.

Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we focused on investigating the integration and segregation of the WM brain connectome in AD and its precursor MCI using traditional methods of graph theory and our suggesting persistent features. We found significant differences between the patients and controls in many network measures. The patients of AD and MCI presented altered global network properties that were characterized as less integrated and more highly segregated comparing to controls. Moreover, persistent homology-based measures demonstrated stronger statistical capability and robustness than traditionally graph-theoretic methods, suggesting it may be a more sensitive way to detect altered brain structures and to better understand AD symptomology at the network level. This study contributes to an improved mechanistic understanding of disease onset and provides a novel approach to potentially track the progression of AD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).

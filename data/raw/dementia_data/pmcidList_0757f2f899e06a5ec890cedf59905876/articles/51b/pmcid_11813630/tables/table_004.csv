"Maltais, 2019",PET data gathering begun 50 min after [18F]‐florbetapir was injected at a mean rate of 4 MBq/kg weight. The mean duration from the PET examination to the clinical assessment in close proximity to the PET was 76.3 days (standard deviation: 40.6),"Age, gender, educational level, cognitive status, MAPT group allocation, ApoE e4 genotype","The mean cortical Aβ load was not found to be associated with a FI derived from noncognitive measures. Nevertheless, in community‐dwelling older adults, Aβ in both the anterior and posterior putamen was found to be associated with FI severity in both cross‐sectional and prospective studies. Furthermore, the progressive accumulation of Aβ in the precuneus region was found to be correlated with a heightened severity of frailty. Frailty following an incident was not associated with cortical or regional Aβ. This research demonstrated that cerebral Aβ accumulation may influence the progression of frailty in elderly individuals over time"

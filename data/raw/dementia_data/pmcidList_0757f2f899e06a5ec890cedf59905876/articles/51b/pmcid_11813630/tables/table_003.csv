Frail patients had the lowest functional connectivity compared to functionally robust patients. There was a notable distinction in functional connectivity within the SMA between robust (nonfrail) patients and frail and prefrail patients, whereas no significant difference was observed between frail and prefrail patients. Frail patients had the lowest functional connectivity compared to functionally robust patients. There was no significant difference in functional connectivity between correlated and anticorrelated brain regions among frail patients. No correlations were observed between frailty and functional connectivity in the network prior to SMA. Functional connectivity in the pre‐SMA network was found to be significantly cortical region dependent and notably diminished in subjects with higher MMSE scores among the confounding variables. Functional connectivity was found to be associated with GPT performance alone, when correlated brain regions were examined individually; functional robustness and frailty were not influenced. Functional connectivity in anticorrelated regions of the SMA network was similarly associated with TMT‐A and partial performance but not with functional robustness or frailty"
"Lammers, 2022",3 T,"SMA, pre‐SMA",Rs‐FC,"Sex, age, BMI, cognitive status, nutritional status, CCI, ASA score, stroke, malignant disease, albumin, NT‐proBNP, creatinine, haemoglobin, anaesthesia type, type of surgery, length of hospital stay, ICU admission rate, length of ICU stay, presence of postoperative complications, severity of surgical complication, presence of postoperative delirium","The authors of the study examined 120 cognitively normal patients which were undergoing various elective surgeries. Fourteen days prior to and 3 months subsequent to the procedure, functional neuroimaging changes were evaluated by introducing dynamic frailty states. After surgery, physical improvement was noted in 19 patients, progression to (pre)frailty was documented in 24 patients and no noticeable shift was found in 77 individuals. Postoperative transition types that were more unfavourable were related with decreased functional connectivity in the pre‐SMA network. An exploratory analysis suggested that the association was restricted to patients who were prefrail at baseline. In the initial analysis, no correlation was found between the kind of transition and the functional connectivity of SMAs. Transition from prefrailty to robustness was linked with greater functional connectivity in an exploratory analysis, and advancement in robust patients was associated with greater SMA network segmentation. Dysfunctions of cortical networks implicated in higher cognitive control of mobility are related with postoperative transitions between frailty stages, according to the findings. As part of strategies to avoid frailty, neurofeedback or brain stimulation may be utilised to target the pre‐SMA"
"Suárez‐Méndez, 2020",0.23 T,"Key areas for motor function and the central processing of proprioception (i.e., SMG, SPL, AG and sensorimotor cortex (precentral and postcentral gyri))",Rs‐FC,"Age, gender, functional status, neuropsychological status","After correction for multiple comparisons, three significant clusters of FC differences emerged: two associated with seeds situated in the right hemisphere (AG and SPL) and one pertaining to the bilateral SMG. The direction of FC disruptions was consistent: the frail group consistently displayed diminished synchronization between the clusters and the seeds in the upper beta frequency band. To begin with, a diminished FC was observed in the vicinity of the right AG and various regions, such as the right motor cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and sensorimotor cortex (precentral and postcentral gyri)Additionally, a diminished frontal cortex (FC) is observed in the vicinity of the right SPL and the anterior regions of the left hemisphere, including the frontal pole, the anterior cingulate, the lateral and medial frontal areas (e.g., premotor cortex) and the left temporal poleIn conclusion, FC was diminished in the bilateral cingulate cortex, areas of the sensorimotor cortex, the right precuneus, and the left premotor cortex (IFG and FMG), SMA and the bilateral SMG.In the alpha, mu, and low beta frequency bands, as well as when the sensorimotor cortex was employed as a seed, no statistically significant variations were observedIn comparison to their robust counterparts, the intranetwork mean FC was overall lower among frail older adults. To be more specific, participants who were frail demonstrated a diminished FC in the upper beta band across the FPN, pDMN and VAN. Moreover, within the upper beta band, the DAN exhibited a strong trend in the same direction (i.e., toward a lower FC in the frail group)"

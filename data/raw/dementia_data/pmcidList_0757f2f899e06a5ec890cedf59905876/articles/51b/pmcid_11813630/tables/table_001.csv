The incidence and number of CMBs in the deep or infratentorial regions were associated with the severity of physical frailty. CMBs located in the lobar regions, either mixed with deep/infratentorial or strictly lobar CMB, were not associated with the severity of the physically frail status. The number of lacunes was significantly associated with the severity of the physical frail status. CMB located in the brainstem was significantly associated with physical frailty. The presence of CMBs in the brainstem was significantly associated with the severity of physical frailty; the presence of CMB in the brainstem was revealed as an independent factor associated with the presence of weakness"
"Ducca, 2022","3 T T2, FLAIR",WHV,—,"Age, sex, race, educational levels, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, current smoking, stroke, cognitive status, BMI, APOEe4 status","Individuals with physical frailty have greater WHV and white matter microstructural abnormalities than nonfrails. This relationship was observed in participants without a history of stroke or dementia but did not persist when analyses were restricted to cognitively normal individuals, that is, the group of participants without MCI or dementia. WHV was significantly associated with new‐onset frailty over a 7‐year follow‐up period, even among cognitively normal adults. These results were consistent in Black and White participants and in men and women. Unlike WHV, general measures of white matter microstructural integrity were not associated with the risk of future frailty. However, secondary analyses did find that the microstructural integrity of specific white matter tracts was associated with future frailty",—,—,—,—

We found no significant group differences in theta nor beta frequencies after multiple comparison correction found in the RH affecting posterior parietal areas (e.g., AG and SPL), the primary somatosensory cortex and the superior occipital cortex. Significant bilateral differences involved areas of the primary motor cortex. These regions comprise those classically associated with traditional generators of mu activity; thus henceforth, we will refer to our results within this range as mu oscillationsSignificant group differences were found in SMR relative power after multiple comparison correction. Frail participants exhibited increased SMR relative power in comparison to their robust peers. The strongest differences were found in frontal areas of the RH, including the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area and the paracingulate gyrus",—

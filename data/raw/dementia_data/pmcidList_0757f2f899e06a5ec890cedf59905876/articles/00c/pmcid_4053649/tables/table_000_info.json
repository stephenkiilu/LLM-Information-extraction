The Speed and Flexibility factor score was unavailable for nine participants. The ANCOVA for cognitive function controlled for age, years of education, and sex. APOE4: apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele; FH: family history of Alzheimer's disease; M: mean; SD: standard deviation; BP: blood pressure; BMI: body mass index; HDL: high density lipoprotein. Missing data: A sub-set of participants did not have vascular risk factors available; blood pressure, BMI, and cholesterol were missing for one participant, insulin was missing for 12 participants, and HDL and glucose were missing for 11 participants.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_000.csv"}

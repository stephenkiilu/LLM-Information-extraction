Scores in between two ordinals were graded with \u20180.5\u2019; PrPSc deposition was also described as fine or course. Subjects 5 was the single case considered to have PrPSc in the white matter.* Subject 12, as parietal tissue was not available for all immunohistochemistry, superior temporal was used instead.# Second time point MRI.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}

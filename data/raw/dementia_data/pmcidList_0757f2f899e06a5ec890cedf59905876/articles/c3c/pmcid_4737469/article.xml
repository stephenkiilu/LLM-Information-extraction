Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly people and is characterized by chronic cortical atrophy and neurodegeneration, resulting in behavioral changes, loss of memory and language function, and general cognitive decline [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is an irreversible and progressive brain disease and usually diagnosed in people older than 65. Nearly 36 million people worldwide are affected by AD, with 5.2 million alone just in the United States [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Tau and amyloid beta (A<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>) in cerebrospinal fluid are considered to be reliable biomarkers of AD [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the invasiveness, cost, and availability associated with the measurement of these quantities are significant drawbacks. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely recognized as a noninvasive means for neurodiagnosis and disease staging. Previous studies using T1-weighted structural MRI revealed AD-induced gray matter (GM) atrophy in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the temporal and cingulate gyri, the precunei, the insular cortices, the caudate nuclei, the frontal cortices [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the sensorimotor cortices, the occipital poles, the cerebellum, and the medial thalami [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] can recover the local profile of water diffusion in tissue, yielding information on white matter (WM) integrity and connectivity that is not available from standard structural MRI. Specifically, tractography methods [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] can be used to fit continuous streamlines through directional diffusion data at each voxel for reconstructing WM fiber tracts. With the obtained tractography, WM integrity can be analyzed with both region-of-interest- (ROI-) based analysis, for example, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and fiber clustering [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and parcellation-based connectome analysis [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>WM abnormalities in AD were reported in previous studies. Liu et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] performed voxelwise TBSS to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) between the AD patients and the healthy controls. Multiple WM tracts, such as parahippocampal WM, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corpus callosum, showed decreased FA in the AD group. Jin et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used the tract-based clustering method to relate fornix degeneration to cognitive decline in AD with various diffusion-derived measures. Mean diffusivity (MD) was shown to be more sensitive to the group difference among AD and normal controls than FA did. Li et al. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] proposed a spectral diffusional connectivity framework to explore the connectivity deficit in AD. The framework was based on studying eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the diffusion tensor field at the voxel level. The peaks of the diffusional connectivity spectra were shifted in the AD group compared to the normal controls that did not shift. Daianu et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found widespread breakdown in AD in the 68-ROI based connectivity networks with multiple connectivity metrics on the “<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-core” structure.</p><p>Importantly, WM tracts can be used to form the connectivity networks that give comprehensive pictures of interactions between different brain regions. A WM connectivity network can be described mathematically as a graph consisting of (1) a collection of nodes, representing the ROIs and (2) a set of edges between nodes, describing the connections (e.g., fiber counts) between ROI pairs. The characteristics of a connectivity network can be described using metrics at three hierarchical levels: global, regional, and local.</p><p>The stability of connectivity networks is influenced by multiple factors, including field strength [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], scanners [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], imaging acquisition parameters [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and tractography parameters [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Zhan et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] compared several tractography and feature extraction methods in relation to AD diagnostic accuracy. Among these factors, the choice of diffusion models is found to be the most influential. The most commonly used approach, namely, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is based on the Gaussian assumption of water diffusion. This approach works well in regions with unidirectional fiber bundles, but this model may fail in regions with fiber crossings, which may introduce tractography errors in these regions. To address this issue, advanced models for high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) were proposed to estimate orientation distribution functions (ODF) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] at each voxel. By detecting the peaks (i.e., local maxima) of the ODF, one can then infer the number of directions contained in each voxel.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the global, regional, and local changes of whole-brain connectivity networks in AD patients in comparison to healthy elderly subjects. DTI and HARDI models are used to construct two different sets of connectivity networks for comparison. Such a systematic network analysis at multiple levels on AD, to our knowledge, has not been attempted previously.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participant Recruitment</title><p>This study involved 26 patients who were diagnosed with probable AD at the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center (ADRDC) in the tertiary hospital of Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. 16 cognitively healthy elderly subjects from the community of Shanghai Chang Ning district were included as the normal control (NC) group. Subjects were enrolled via self-referral or referral from families or physicians. The study was conducted from May 2011 to May 2012 at ADRDC. The SMHC Institution's Ethical Committee approved the consent form and the study protocol. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or their legal guardians.</p><p>The ages of the AD subjects enrolled ranged from 50s to 90s. Prior to enrollment, patients provided their medical history and were given physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and both T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans. Enrollment criteria included (1) the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; (2) the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for the Alzheimer's dementia; (3) a Hachinski Ischemia Score less than 4; (4) the systolic blood pressure between 95 and 160 and the diastolic blood pressure between 60 and 95; (5) identification of a responsible and consistent caregiver; (6) absence of diabetes, renal impairment, significant systemic conditions, psychiatric disorders, seizures, or traumatic brain injuries that could compromise their cognitive or brain functions; (7) significant brain abnormalities on the patient's T1-weighted MRI; (8) clinical score requirements. In the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], there are three cut-off thresholds for AD diagnosis according to education levels: (1) AD subjects who had not been educated exhibited MMSE scores &lt;18; (2) those with elementary school education exhibited MMSE scores &lt;21; (3) those with higher than middle school education exhibited MMSE scores &lt;25. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was equal or more than 1.</p><p>The NC group was cognitively functioning healthy individuals. The NC group did not have any history of cognitive decline, neurological disorders, or uncontrolled systemic medical disorders. Their CDR scales were equal to 0. All subjects in the study were required to have fewer than two lacunar ischemia strokes (of diameter &lt;1 cm) in the brain, as revealed by FLAIR.</p><p>The demography and clinical scores for the AD group and the NC group are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in age or education. The difference was observed in gender. However, the effects of gender, age, education level, and brain size would be regressed out in our analysis. As expected, the group difference was observed in the MMSE (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and CDR scores (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. MR Image Acquisition</title><p>MRI images were scanned with a Siemens MAGNETOM VERIO 3 T scanner at SMHC. T1-weighted images were obtained with 128 sagittal slices using the 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 2,530 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, flip angle = 7°, and spatial resolution = 1 × 1 × 1.3 mm<sup>3</sup>, and the acquisition time was 8 minutes 7 seconds. The DWI images were acquired with 75 axial slices by using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence that covered the whole brain. The acquisition parameters were as follows: TR = 10,000 ms, TE = 91 ms, and spatial resolution = 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. A total volume of 62 directions was acquired, where two volumes were without diffusion gradient (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 0) and the rest 60 volumes were with diffusion gradient of <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 1,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The acquisition time was 5 minutes and 42 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Image Preprocessing</title><p>T1-weighted images were first resampled to be 1 mm isotropic, intensity inhomogeneity corrected [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and skull stripped to remove nonbrain tissues [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The resulting images were then tissue segmented to separate GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with FSL FAST (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/</ext-link>). DWI images were skull stripped and then corrected for eddy-current induced distortion with FSL. FA and MD images were then extracted from DWI data after diffusion tensor fitting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Network Construction</title><p>Whole-brain tractography was performed with both DTI and HARDI models. For DTI, the diffusion tensors were fitted to the data using a weighted-least-squares estimation algorithm and the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue was taken as the principal diffusion direction [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Seed points were chosen as voxels with FA &gt; 0.3. The maximum turning angle was set to 45° and tracking was stopped when FA &lt; 0.2. The allowed fiber length was at minimum, 20 mm, and at maximum, 300 mm. For HARDI, ODFs were estimated with dictionary-based spherical deconvolution [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A maximum of three peaks were detected from the ODF at each voxel [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Four seeds were randomly sampled within each seed voxel. The criteria of fiber tracking were the same for both methods. The resulting tractography was manually visualized and checked in ParaView (Kitware, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.paraview.org/">http://www.paraview.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] is a widely used high-resolution T1-weighted brain parcellation based on a single adult subject, which includes 90 cortical and subcortical brain regions for the cerebrum. The names and abbreviations of these 90 ROIs are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. First, we nonlinearly registered the AAL template to each subject's segmented T1-weighted image using HAMMER [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Then, the T1-weighted image was rigidly aligned to the FA image. The original 90 ROIs of the AAL template were transferred to each individual's DWI space using the deformation fields and the affine transformation matrix generated during the registration step. These ROIs were used as nodes in the connectivity network for each subject.</p><p>Two ROIs were considered anatomically connected, if there were fibers traversing them. In the network, the edge, connecting the nodes representing these two ROIs, was defined as the number of fibers connecting them. Two ROIs were considered connected if there were no less than four fibers between them, which has been proven effective to reduce false-positive connections [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a result, the WM connectivity network, represented by a symmetric 90 × 90 matrix, was constructed for each subject. The network was weighted and undirected.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Multilevel Network Measures</title><p>Three hierarchical levels (global, regional, and local) of complex network measures were used to compare the measures of connectivity networks constructed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.4">Section 2.4</xref> between the AD group and the NC group.

For the HARDI case, we identified 20 hub nodes in the NC group, including 6 association cortical regions, 13 paralimbic cortical regions, and 1 primary cortical region. Only 16 hub nodes were identified in the AD group, including 5 association regions and 11 paralimbic regions. In both groups, 12 ROIs were identified as hubs in common, including the bilateral superior frontal gyri, dorsolateral (SFGdor), the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), the bilateral median cingulate gyri (MCG), the bilateral precunei (PCUN), the bilateral putamina (PUT), and the bilateral thalami (THA). In addition, 4 ROIs, such as the left insula (INS.L), the right caudate nucleus (CAU.R), and the bilateral pallida (PAL), were identified as the hubs in the AD group but not in the NC group. 8 ROIs, such as the right medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.R), the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (PCG), the right calcarine cortex (CAL.R), the right cuneus (CUN.R), the bilateral superior occipital gyri (SOG), and the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG.L), were identified as the hubs in the NC group but not in the AD group. For the DTI case, most of the hubs identified in the HARDI case were also detected. The AD group had the exact 16 hubs as in the HARDI case, while the NC group only had 19 hubs.

It is obvious that the HARDI model was able to detect noticeably more pairs of different connections between the groups (30 pairs in HARDI versus 20 pairs in DTI). For example, the connections through the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L), the right lingual gyrus (LING.R), the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L), the bilateral thalami (THA), the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L), and the left hippocampus (HIP.L) were only shown in the HARDI case.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>This study investigates the impact of AD on the topological characteristics of the WM connectivity network at three hierarchical levels, global, regional, and local level, through tractography data reconstructed using DTI and HARDI methods, respectively. The main findings are as follows: (1) the global and average local network efficiency are reduced in AD, with increased shortest path length; (2) the number of regional hubs and nodal efficiency decreases in AD; (3) the local connections weaken in AD; (4) the HARDI method has an advantage over the DTI method in identifying more abnormal network characteristics at all the three levels.</p><p>At the global level, consistent with the previous studies [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], our results indicate that the WM connectivity networks of both AD and NC have the small-world topology. Although the AD networks show a slightly elevated small-world attribute, most global measures are lower in AD, compared to those in NC. AD patients show significant decreases in global efficiency and average local efficiency, but increases in normalized shortest path length. Global efficiency and average local efficiency are known to reflect the overall ability of information transfer between different nodes in a network. They are comprehensive indices for the capability of parallel information processing. The reductions in those measures can be attributed to the degeneration of WM, which indicates that connections between cortical regions are abnormal. The less strength of connections between cortical regions is due to the damaged WM integrity, resulting in longer pathways that connect different regions in the brain. The breakdown in the optimal brain balance between the local specialization and the global integration causes information processing to malfunction in AD. Similarly to previous studies [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we have also found that the normalized weighted shortest path length increases in the AD group. Shortest path length ensures interregional effective communication, or prompt transfer of information between regions, which constitutes the basis of cognitive processes [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The WM damage can lead to an increase in shortest path length. Therefore, it is likely that, in people with AD, information may flash in a certain brain region but fail to transmit to other regions effectively to form stable memories. The normalized clustering coefficient is a ratio of local information transfer capability in a network to that of a random network. In AD, its increase reflects the reinforcement of information transfer capability. Likewise, previous studies have also found a greater clustering coefficient and a longer absolute path length in AD, which may indicate that the organization of the cortical network is least optimal in AD [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>At the regional level, several hubs identified in NC are not shown in AD, such as precuneus (PCUN) and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). These two regions also demonstrate reduced connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a stage with high risk in developing AD [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which may suggest that these two regions maintain pivotal roles in both structural and functional default mode networks in AD [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The AD networks also show decreased nodal efficiency in many cortical regions, mainly located in the bilateral cunei (CUN), the right precuneus (PCUN.R), the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (PCG), the right temporal pole, middle (TPOmid.R), and the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG.R). The cuneus (CUN), the precuneus (PCUN), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) are thought to be involved in the episodic memory information transmission and malfunction in AD [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although the degeneration of the posterior cingulate gyrus was originally interpreted as not being a direct consequence of degeneration in the medial temporal lobe, recent studies have revealed that this area has atrophy and metabolic abnormalities in incipient AD [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a study that examined the cingulum tract in AD, both the anterior and posterior regions were affected [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The posterior cingulate region is a key “hub” affected in AD. The temporal pole, middle (TPOmid), and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) are involved in semantic memory processing and recognition [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and show atrophy and neuronal loss in AD [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Notably, the decreased efficiency in the temporal lobes was observed to be mainly located in the right hemisphere. Together, the reduced nodal efficiency suggests that possible WM degeneration in these brain regions may negatively affect information transmission and functional integration in AD patients.</p><p>At the local level, weaker connection (lower fiber counts) happens predominantly in the area of the bilateral precunei (PCUN), the right cuneus (CUN.R), the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L), and left hippocampal gyrus (HIP.L). These areas, which are mostly associated with linguistic integration, emotion, and semantic memory [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], are affected in AD patients [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is worth noting that precuneus, cuneus, and temporal lobe also show reduced nodal efficiency at the regional level. In addition to the typically well-known affected regions in AD, the right amygdala (AMYG.R) and the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG.R) show weaker connections as well. These regions are the structures mostly involved in emotional processing, perceptions, psychological states, and behavioral responses [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Weaker connections can also be identified at the right thalamus (THA.R), which is known to have a significantly reduced volume in AD [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, a few regions show increased local connection in the AD group than in the NC group, for example, the connection between the left insula (INS.L) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL.L). It is possible that this may result from the compensation to weak connections in the neighboring regions.</p><p>Overall, the HARDI method outperforms the DTI method in terms of differentiating AD and NC at all three levels. At the global level, the HARDI method has more statistical power in distinguishing the groups for all the measures, according to the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. The group differences of all the measures are statistically significant in the HARDI case, while most of them are not statistically significant in the DTI case. At the regional level, the HARDI method detects more regions with reduced nodal efficiency. These include the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (PCG) and the bilateral precunei (PCUN), while the results of the DTI method only show the unilateral deficiency of these regions. The results from the HARDI method are more consistent with the pathology of AD, as the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and precunei are both associated with memory processing and affected in AD [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. At the local level, the two methods show the greatest difference. The HARDI method is able to identify 50% more of the weaker connections in AD than the DTI method (30 pairs versus 20 pairs). This may be because the HARDI method is able to find the correct tract directions at the fiber crossing regions and can find more connections in the NC group. Specifically, the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L), the right thalamus (THA.R), and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L), especially the left hippocampus (HIP.L) and the left cuneus (CUN.L), are only found using the HARDI method. During the early onset of AD, the superior parietal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus undergo neuronal loss [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Besides the neocortical atrophy, subcortical structures, such as the thalamus, also suffer atrophy and may contribute to cognitive decline and emotion disorder in AD [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Fiber count is one of the most commonly used measures in evaluating connectivity characteristics. For example, Dennis et al. [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] computed graph theory metrics based on the fiber count to track changes in both structural connectivity and network efficiency in young healthy individuals, while Zhan et al. [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] developed a machine learning framework to classify different stages of AD with fiber counts as features. However, sometimes, fiber count may not be a suitable feature in connectivity studies. For instance, in [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], the networks constructed with the mean FA, MD, and fiber length provided better performance in identifying high-risk autistic infants than fiber count. Therefore, we will consider incorporating other network measures in our future work since they may provide additional insights into connectivity breakdown, especially for the case that the fiber count based networks cannot reveal the progression of AD.</p><p>The conventional statistical analysis on network properties is often performed in a univariate manner, that is, pairwise comparison between groups. This might overlook the interaction among sets of connections in group difference. On the other hand, instead of doing simple pairwise comparison, a classification framework is able to consider all individual connection features, as well as their relationships, for selecting the most discriminative features for classification [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>–<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Ensemble learning algorithm, such as random forest, is one of this type of classification algorithms that can be applied to identify discriminative connectivity patterns in a multivariate manner for AD or MCI classification. This will be our future work.</p><p>We do acknowledge that there are some limitations in this study. Firstly, the sample size of our study is quite small. In the future, more participants need to be recruited to increase the statistic power of the results. Secondly, the lack of gold standard for regional parcellation makes the definition of ROI not very precise, especially on the boundary. Registration error may also play a role in this issue. Therefore, it may affect the accuracy in the analysis of connectivity networks [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thirdly, the underlying biological relationship between the network properties and the AD progression is currently unclear. Studying the intermediate stage, for example, MCI, may be beneficial for further understanding of the relationship [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In the future work, we will include participants from this stage to perform a more comprehensive study on this topic.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we performed a systematic study on the WM connectivity comparison at three hierarchical levels (global, regional, and local) between the two groups: the AD group and the NC group. The analysis was conducted using tractography data generated using two diffusion models (DTI and HARDI) to evaluate the influence of tractography on the network analysis. Globally, both the AD group and the NC group demonstrate the small-world topology. However, many global measures, such as global efficiency, average local efficiency, and normalized shortest path length, were suboptimal in the AD group. Regionally, the AD group had the reduced number of hubs and significantly decreased nodal efficiency in the precuneus and the temporal lobe (the well-known atrophic regions in AD). Locally, weaker connections exist in these regions, as well as regions in the limbic system and the subcortex, such as hippocampus and thalamus. The HARDI method outperforms the DTI method at all three levels since the advanced model in the HARDI method can more accurately reflect the underlying complex fiber configurations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81201030, 61210001, 81571298, and 61473190), the China Ministry of Science and Technology (2009BAI77B03), the National Key Clinical Disciplines at Shanghai Mental Health Center (OMA-MH, 2011-873), the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Grants (134119a2600, 14411965000), the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Technological Innovation Special Fund (YG2014MS39), the SHSMU-ION Research Center for Brain Disorders, and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University K.

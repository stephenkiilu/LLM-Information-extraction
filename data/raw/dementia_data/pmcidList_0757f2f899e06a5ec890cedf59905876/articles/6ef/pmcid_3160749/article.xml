The importance of medical intervention in pre-dementia (Albert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2011</xref>) or in the pre-symptomatic (Sperling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2011</xref>) phase of AD has been a target of active research. For disease-preventive clinical trials, in which pre-diagnostic intervention is required, biomarkers that are linked to pathology are needed, both for early diagnosis and for monitoring, since pathological changes in AD are believed to have already developed prior to the onset of symptoms (Jack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>).</p><p>Efforts have been made to establish biomarkers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is a widely prevalent, non-invasive modality. A wide array of studies have characterized the structural MRI features (for review, McEvoy and Brewer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>) and the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) features (for review, Chua et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2008</xref>; Stebbins and Murphy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>), related to AD. Although robust patterns of MR-detectable pathology, such as volume loss in the medial temporal lobe or a decrease in the diffusion anisotropy of the limbic white matter (WM) fibers, have been identified, improvements in the accuracy with which AD can be identified is required; namely, there is a considerable amount of overlap between cognitively normal elderly participants (NC) and AD patients, especially in the pre-dementia phase.</p><p>To increase the accuracy of MRI in differentiating AD from NC, a multi-modal MRI analysis (structural MRI + DTI-derived contrasts) is one of the common approaches (Di Paola et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2010</xref>; Gold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>). However, whether the combination can increase the accuracy to predict conversion from MCI to AD, compared to the single-modal approach, still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we introduce a method called “multi-modal MRI analysis with disease-specific spatial filtering” (MDSF), based on the following hypotheses. First, assuming that there are multiple pathologies with different spatial distributions in a single disease, the optimized combination of multiple MR modalities could increase the power to separate diseased brains from normal brains. Second, if the purpose of the analysis is to investigate the existence of known pathological features of a particular disease, such features can be sensitively detected by defining regions-of-interest (ROI) that follows the expected distribution of the pathology. In MDSF, such ROIs [disease-specific spatial filters (DSF)] were created independently for multiple MR modalities (e.g., structural MRI and DTI-derived contrasts), and the MR measures extracted from the corresponding DSF were optimally combined to separate diseased brains from control brains.</p><p>In this study, images from 19 AD patients and 22 NC participants were used as the training dataset to create DSF for each MR contrast, followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to optimally combine the MR measures to calculate a discriminant score. We applied the resultant DSF to the test dataset, which consists of images from patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and investigated whether the resultant discriminant score could predict the conversion to AD. The classification accuracy was compared with that achieved by single MR measures or with cognitive scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We used data from a study of a well-characterized group of individuals (Mielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>). Briefly, the study sample comprised 25 probable-AD patients (mean age, 75.6) who met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1984</xref>), with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 1; 25 aMCI patients (mean age, 75.8) who met the criteria for amnestic MCI (Petersen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2004</xref>) with a CDR = 0.5; and 25 NC participants (mean age, 74.3) with a CDR = 0. There were no differences among these groups with regard to age, race, education, and the occurrence of vascular conditions (Mielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>). Written, informed consent was obtained under the oversight of the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Three aMCI patients and three NC participants were excluded because the DTI did not cover the whole-brain. After 3 years of follow-up, six aMCI patients had converted to AD and were defined as aMCI-converters. The remaining 16 patients were defined as aMCI-stable. Therefore, the final images used in this analyses were from 19 AD, 6 aMCI-converters, 16 aMCI-stable patients, and 22 NC participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluations</title><p>The diagnosis and neuropsychiatric evaluations [CDR, the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive portion (ADAS-cog), the mini mental state examination (MMSE), and the geriatric depression scale (GDS)] were performed at the time of the MRI scan by the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) staff. Re-evaluation of the diagnosis was continued annually for 3 years.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI scans and image processing</title><p>For each participant, a DTI, co-registered, double-echo fast spin echo (DE-FSE), and a T<sub>1</sub>-weighted image were acquired using a 3T scanner (Gyroscan NT, Philips Medical Systems). The parameters were as follows. DTI: single-shot echo-planar imaging; 30 diffusion weighting orientations; <italic>b</italic>-value 700 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; 50–60 gapless whole-brain axial sections of 2.2 mm thickness; matrix 96 × 96; field of view (FOV) 212 mm × 212 mm; zero-filled to 256 mm × 256 mm. DE-FSE: first echo time (TE) 10.1 ms; second TE 96.0 ms; repetition time (TR) 3,000 ms; 48 gapless whole-brain axial slices of 3 mm thickness; matrix 256 × 247; FOV 240 mm × 210 mm; zero-filled to 256 mm × 256 mm. T<sub>1</sub>-weighted image: magnetization-prepared rapid gradient recalled echo; TE 3.2 ms; TR 6.9 ms; matrix 256 × 256 × 170; FOV 240 mm × 240 mm × 204 mm; zero-filled to 256 mm × 256 mm × 204 mm. After the raw diffusion-weighted images were corrected for motion, eddy current, and B0-susceptibility distortion (Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2008</xref>), a tensor field was calculated. A T<sub>2</sub> map was calculated from the DE-FSE, using the simple mono-exponential model. All images were co-registered and re-sliced to 1 mm isotropic resolution (181 × 217 × 181 matrix).</p></sec><sec><title>Normalization of the images to the JHU-MNI atlas</title><p>Diffusion tensor imaging and T<sub>2</sub> maps were normalized to a multi-modal JHU-MNI atlas, as previously described (Oishi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>). Briefly, DTI was transformed using first affine transformation and then large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). The resultant matrices were applied to the corresponding T<sub>2</sub> maps for the normalization. From the normalized tensor, FA, MD, axial diffusion (λ<sub>||</sub>), and radial diffusion (λ<sub>⊥</sub>) maps were calculated. The Jacobian map was calculated from the transformation matrix of LDDMM (called Jacobian-DTI hereafter) for the morphometric analysis.</p><p>For the analysis of the T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images, we followed a voxel-based morphometry method (Ashburner and Friston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2000</xref>), with several modifications. First, tissue segmentation was performed for individual T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images using VBM5.1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. A gray matter (GM) template was created from the JHU-MNI atlas the same way. There was no isotropic smoothing after segmentation. GM segmentation of each individual was normalized to the GM template, first using 12-parameter affine transformation and then using LDDMM. The Jacobian map (called Jacobian-T<sub>1</sub> hereafter) was calculated from the transformation matrix of LDDMM.</p><p>The final products for each participant after normalizations were: Jacobian-T<sub>1</sub>; Jacobian-DTI; FA; MD; λ<sub>||</sub>; λ<sub>⊥</sub>; and T<sub>2</sub> measures, mapped on the atlas space (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).

Since all images were already normalized to the atlas space (JHU-MNI atlas) by LDDMM, we used only a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test of SPM5 without smoothing. The reason we did not use isotropic smoothing is that it introduces partial volume effects, especially for the WM, in which tracts with very different connectivity are adjacent to each other. The areas with statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate) were binarized to create a mask called a DSF, which represented the spatial distribution of AD-related alterations in each MR parameter. The DSF of each MR parameter was called DSF-“parameter name”. For example, the DSF of the FA map was called the DSF-FA. Note that the DSF-Jacobian-ex-DTI indicated areas of expansion, and the DSF-Jacobian-DTI indicated areas of atrophy.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimization of the combination of MR measures to separate AD from NC using a training dataset</title><p>The eight DSFs were applied to the normalized images of each subject. MR measures inside the corresponding DSF were averaged and called the DSF-“parameter name” value. As a result, each subject had eight DSF values.</p><p>In order to combine the DSF values to increase the classification power, we used LDA. Separate LDFs were performed using the DTI-derived values (Jacobian-DTI, Jacobian-ex-DTI, FA, MD, λ<sub>||</sub>, and λ<sub>⊥</sub>), and all the MR values (Jacobian-T<sub>1</sub>, Jacobian-DTI, Jacobian-ex-DTI, FA, MD, λ<sub>||</sub>, λ<sub>⊥</sub>, and T<sub>2</sub>), as the input variables. The classification score for DTI-derived DSF values was called the DTI score, and the classification score for all DSF values was called the MRI score.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of the optimized combination of DSF to the aMCI group</title><p>Previous steps included the creation of the DSFs and discriminant function to calculate discriminant scores (DTI score and MRI score), which were required to perform MDSF. We applied the MDSF to the aMCI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) to see whether the DTI score and the MRI score could accurately classify aMCI-converters and aMCI-stable patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). The ROC analyses were performed to assess the classification performance. SPSS 19 (IBM Corporation, New York, USA) was used to create ROC curves. MedCalc 11.5.1 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) was used for the non-parametric pair-wise comparison between the areas under the ROC curves.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison between MRI score and cognitive scales</title><p>We performed permutation tests and ROC analysis for the two types of cognitive scales (ADAS-cog and MMSE), as well as for the number of correct answers in the immediate and delayed story recall of the WMS-III, in order to assess the accuracy of separating aMCI-converter from aMCI-stable patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Normalization of the images to the JHU-MNI atlas</title><p>All 63 images were normalized to the JHU-MNI template.

The WM alterations were mainly found in the <italic>limbic fibers</italic> (the fornix, the cingulum hippocampal area, and the posterior cingulate), the <italic>forceps major and minor</italic> (including the splenium and the genu of the corpus callosum), and the <italic>periventricular</italic> WM areas. In addition, small areas with significant alterations were scattered in the gyrus rectus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the temporal–parietal lobes. Generally, the limbic fibers and the forceps showed a decrease in the FA, with an increase in the MD, which was mainly caused by a greater increase in the λ<sub>⊥</sub> than in the λ<sub>||</sub>. Among these fibers, the fornix had the most striking change, with atrophy and increased T<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, a general increase in diffusivity, accompanied by a T<sub>2</sub> increase, was found in the area surrounding the lateral ventricles. To eliminate the possibility that the decreased FA and increased diffusivity were due to misregistration of the ventricle, the ventricles of each image were manually defined and normalized by applying the corresponding transformations. Misregistration of the ventricle was not found in any of the abnormal FA/diffusivity areas, except for the area medial to the left posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, indicated by the white arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The significant changes in FA and diffusivity in this area, therefore, were artifacts.</p><p>Gray matter atrophy was mainly found in the hippocampus, the entorhinal area, and the thalamus.

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Spatial specificity of the WM and GM alterations</title><p>We found two different patterns of WM alterations in AD. Namely, an FA reduction associated with a λ<sub>⊥</sub>-predominant increase in diffusivity in the limbic fibers and the forceps, and a general increase in diffusivity with a T<sub>2</sub> increase found in the periventricular area. Alterations in the fornix, cingulum, and the splenium of the corpus callosum were consistent with earlier ROI studies (Naggara et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2006</xref>; Ringman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2007</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>; Mielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>). A recent study using tract-based analysis (TBSS; Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2006</xref>), also detected alterations in these structures (Damoiseaux et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Acosta-Cabronero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2010</xref>), supporting the validity of our findings. A test for CSF contamination suggested a highly accurate registration by LDDMM, with a minimal CSF contribution. An exception was in the areas around the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles, which were eliminated from the subsequent analyses. The periventricular WM alterations in AD are in accordance with past findings, where they were designated periventricular hyperintense lesions (PVH; Targosz-Gajniak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>). We also identified alterations in the superficial WM (Oishi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2008</xref>) that had been found in past studies (Bozzali et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2002</xref>; Damoiseaux et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>).</p><p>Our main findings with regard to GM morphometry in AD mostly agree with past findings, showing atrophy in the hippocampal complex, the basal nucleus of Meynert, and the thalamus (Jack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1999</xref>; Morris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>; Karas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2004</xref>; Teipel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2005</xref>; de Jong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2008</xref>; McEvoy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). However, the distribution of the abnormalities was limited in our study, compared to the previous studies. One of the reasons for this was that our voxel-based analysis did not use spatial smoothing, which would have led to lower sensitivity to detect abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Predictive ability of the MDSF</title><p>The overall agreement of the above VBA findings with previous reports confirms that our DSF capture most locations with significant anatomical alterations. Once the locations with a potential abnormality are encoded in the DSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the MRI/DTI scores can be generated for each patient by applying the DSFs to the multi-modal MRI data. The ROC analyses indicated that the MRI and DTI scores better predicted conversion from aMCI to AD, compared to the analysis using a single MR contrast alone or cognitive scales. This indicates the potential of multi-modal measurement to increase the value of MRI in the early diagnosis of AD.</p><p>There were several reasons we think the MDSF approach could classify aMCI-converters from aMCI-stable patients better than the single-modal approach. First, multiple structures with different pathologies are involved in AD. Especially in the early phase, WM alteration detected by DTI-derived measurements has been found independently of the GM atrophy (Bai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>; Agosta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>). Therefore, diffusion measurements and morphometric measurements seems to be complementary, and the combination of these would capture the pathology of AD comprehensively. Second, AD is one of the neurodegenerative diseases in which particular brain structures systematically and gradually degenerate. This systematic feature (not random) is ideal for creating the DSF.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitations of the current study were the small number of the training dataset (AD and NC) and the testing dataset (aMCI). Beyond the technical demonstration, the use of larger training and testing datasets would be necessary to create DSFs and to evaluate their usefulness in actual clinical settings. The application of this method to the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases would also be necessary to further evaluate the efficacy of this method.</p><p>In summary, the MDSF approach increased the predictive power of MRI to identify aMCI patients who might convert to AD. This method has the potential to quantitatively analyze MRI data to identify patients at risk for developing AD.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>Peter C.

Disorder (MDD) and patterns of axonal injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve moderate-severe TBI patients and 26 controls were imaged using [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO positron emission tomography (PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TBI patients and a second group of 32 controls also underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment. Patients included six with post-injury MDD (TBI-MDD) and six without (TBI-NON). Non-displaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO values were used to index D2/D3 receptor availability, and were calculated using a reference region procedure. Differences in BP<sub>ND</sub> were examined using voxelwise and region-of-interest analyses. White matter microstructure integrity, quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA), was assessed and correlated with BP<sub>ND</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Lower [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> was found in the caudate across all TBI patients when compared to controls. Lower [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> was observed in the caudate of TBI-MDD patients and increased [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> in the Amygdala of TBI-NON patients compared to controls. There were no significant differences in [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patients. Furthermore, DTI provided evidence of axonal injury following TBI. The uncinate fasciculus and cingulum had abnormally low FA, with the uncinate particularly affected in TBI-MDD patients.

These are associated with dopaminergic abnormalities, including direct damage to dopaminergic nuclei, axonal injury to dopaminergic neurons and subsequent changes in dopamine production, metabolism and clearance (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bales et al., 2009</xref>). Neuroimaging studies of the human dopaminergic system after TBI have been limited. Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels can be reduced (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Donnemiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>), with associated damage within the substantia nigra (SN) and nigrostriatal projections (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2018</xref>).

Around a third of TBI patients develop major depressive disorder (MDD), with the risk increasing with greater injury severity (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Kreutzer et al., 2001</xref>). Depression often hinders recovery and leads to long-term morbidity (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Dikmen et al., 2003</xref>), but biological causes of MDD after TBI have seldom been investigated. In studies of non-traumatic MDD, alterations in dopamine receptors have been shown to be related to depressive symptoms (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">D'Haenen and Bossuyt, 1994</xref>) and abnormalities within the limbic system have often been observed (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Drevets et al., 2008</xref>). High levels of D3 receptors are seen in limbic structures (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 1994</xref>) and potentially play an important role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Sokoloff et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO has the potential to clarify the aetiology of post-traumatic depression and inform a more targeted approach to treating this disabling condition.</p><p id="p0040">Here we used [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO PET to measure D2/D3 receptor availability following TBI. We tested the hypothesis that TBI patients would show abnormalities of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding and that patients with and without MDD will show distinct binding patterns. We used structural MRI to examine grey matter volume changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine the relationship to D2/D3 receptor availability and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate axonal injury and its relationship to D2/D3 receptor availability.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="p0045">Twelve TBI patients with a single moderate-severe TBI, as classified by the Mayo criteria (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Malec et al., 2007</xref>), were assessed using [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO PET, structural T1 MRI, DTI and neuropsychological tests in this cross-sectional study. A comparative group of 26 age-matched healthy controls were also assessed using [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO PET and structural T1 MRI. For comparison of DTI, grey matter (GM) volume and cognitive performance, a second age-matched control group were recruited (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 32). Demographics of healthy controls can be found in appendix Table B.1. Patients and controls were carefully selected to avoid the potential confound of medications.

No other psychiatric illnesses were identified in any of the patients. In addition, patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Beck and Beamesderfer, 1974</xref>) to assess current severity of major depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Imaging protocol</title><p id="p0065">Patients and controls underwent a single PET scan acquired using a Siemens Biograph 16 HI-REZ PET-CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare). The radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO was administered as an intravenous bolus over 30 s and dynamic PET data was acquired for 90 min. Injected [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO did not exceed 3 μg total mass to avoid symptoms of nausea that have previously been reported. Administration of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO below 3 μg have previously been used to effectively quantify D2/D3 receptors <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Erritzoe et al., 2014</xref>). A low-dose computed tomography (CT) image was acquired prior to administration of the radiotracer for attenuation correction during PET reconstruction. Further information about reconstruction of the dynamic PET images can be found in previously published literature (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Searle et al., 2010</xref>). In summary, the PET data were binned into 26 frames (8 × 15 s, 3 × 60 s, 5 × 2 min, 5 × 5 min, 5 × 10 min) and reconstructed using Fourier re-binning and two-dimensional filtered back projection with a ramp filter at Nyquist cutoff frequency. Image data were smoothed with a Gaussian filter (5 mm full-width at half-maximum). Patients and controls who had PET scanning had a standard high-resolution T1 MPRAGE scan (160 1-mm-thick transverse slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, FA = 9°, in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256, field of view = 25.6 × 25.6 cm), acquired for use in the co-registration of parametric [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> images. Standard high-resolution T1 was acquired using two Siemens 3T Verio MRI's (Siemens Healthcare).</p><p id="p0070">For GM volume and DTI analyses, patients and a separate control group were scanned using the same Siemens 3T Verio MRI (Appendix fig. A.1). Acquisition of diffusion weighted imaging for diffusion tensor imaging analysis was performed on a 3T Veiro MRI using a 64-direction protocol with b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and four interleaved b = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, with TE/TR 103/9500 ms, 64 contiguous slices, FoV 256 mm and voxel size 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to facilitate assessment of focal lesions in patients was also acquired. No MRI analysis was performed across the two scanners.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>Imaging analysis</title><p id="p0075">Non-displaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) images of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO were generated using a molecular imaging and kinetic analysis toolbox (MIAKAT) (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gunn et al., 2016</xref>). The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Lammertsma and Hume, 1996</xref>) with cerebellar grey matter (GM) as the reference region was used for generation of parametric D2/D3 BP<sub>ND</sub> images, as per previous research (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Searle et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">T1 images were segmented into GM and white matter (WM) using SPM8. Tissue segmentations were then warped to a group template using a diffeomorphic non-linear image registration procedure (DARTEL) (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 2007</xref>). The group template was then registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) space using an affine registration. Parametric [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> images were co-registered to their relative T1 images using a rigid-body registration and then warped into MNI152 space using the template registration flow-fields obtained from the DARTEL registration. Normalized BP<sub>ND</sub> images were then masked using a thresholded GM template and smoothed (8 mm full-width at half-maximum). To investigate the presence of GM atrophy, GM tissue segmentations of patients and controls acquired on the same scanner were warped to a group template using DARTEL and standardized to MNI152 space for use in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 2000</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">Two types of analysis were performed to investigate [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub>: voxelwise analysis in images registered into standard MNI152 space and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis performed in subject T1 space. [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> values were extracted using an anatomical atlas previously developed for use in regional analysis of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO data (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Tziortzi et al., 2011</xref>). The atlas was first affine-registered from MNI152 space to the group template. Next, the atlas was inversely warped to each subject's native T1 using DARTEL and subject-specific flow-fields. Native-space anatomical maps were visually assessed to ensure accuracy of registration. To further improve accuracy, ROIs were intersected with the subject's 30% thresholded GM tissue probability map (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; .3) to extract mean regional BP<sub>ND</sub> values. Eight ROIs were selected <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> based on their involvement in the dopaminergic system, prominence of dopamine D2/D3 receptors and involvement in cognitive and emotional processing. The ROIs selected were; accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hypothalamus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and substantia nigra. Although the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays an important role in dopaminergic functioning within the brain, the size of this region and difficulty to accurately delineate the VTA could lead to unreliable results. We therefore did not explore this region in this analysis given the relatively low spatial resolution of PET and potential partial volume effects. Lesions present on T1 and FLAIR sequences in patients were manually segmented and excluded from ROI and voxelwise analysis.</p><p id="p0090">Diffusion tensor imaging was used to derive FA as a measure of white matter microstructure. Fractional anisotropy maps were constructed using the DTI-TK toolbox (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>) and subsequently skeletonized for ROI analysis using TBSS (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). The mean FA for each ROI was extracted across patients and controls to investigate group differences and any relationship to [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub>. To examine the effect of TBI on dopaminergic neurons, the nigrostriatal projections (nigro-caudate, nigro-putamen, nigro-accumbens) were included in our analyses. A map of the area through which the nigrostriatal tract passes, as well as nigro-caudate, nigro-putamen and nigro-nucleus accumbens components of this map, was created using 100 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>). Fiber-tracking was performed in both directions between the left and right substantia nigra and the corresponding nucleus accumbens, putamen and caudate using the MRtrix package (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Tournier et al., 2012</xref>). Three thousand tracks were performed with maximum angle between successive steps limited to 45°. A probability mask based on the percentage of tracks passing through each voxel was created for each individual and thresholded at 5%. All masks were binarised and masks from the two directions of tracking were combined. A group probabilistic mask that was then thresholded at 25% to create a group mask.</p><p id="p0095">The FA values for controls and patients were then extracted using these tract masks to assess any relationships between white matter integrity and binding potentials. We also investigated the impact of TBI upon limbic connections using two tracts (the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus) from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) WM atlas. These tracts were selected as they have previously been implicated in non-traumatic MDD (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, we measured FA from the anterior thalamic projection as a control region which is commonly affected after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.7</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0100">Statistical analysis was performed in two stages.

Complementary pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction or one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine the drivers of any significant group-by-ROI interactions, again using R version 3.2.3. Previous literature has demonstrated age-related differences in dopaminergic levels (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kaasinen and Rinne, 2002</xref>) as well as time-dependent changes to dopaminergic function after TBI (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>).

VBM was performed using the standardized GM tissue segmentations, using non-parametric permutation tests in FSL with 10,000 permutations. Age, gender and intracranial volume (ICV) were covariates in the analysis. Previous research has demonstrated reductions to SN volume after TBI and its relationship to dopaminergic changes (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore also examined SN volume and it's relationship to [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub>. GM volume was measured in the SN of patients and controls by intersecting a SN mask with standardized GM tissue segmentations. An independent samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used to examine group differences, corrected for age and ICV.

Blockade studies using D3-specific antagonists have illustrated that D2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the caudate (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Searle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Tziortzi et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, reductions in caudate binding seen in TBI patients may primarily reflect reduced availability of D2 receptors after TBI. In contrast, the amygdala consists of a mixture of D2 and D3 receptors, as shown by human post-mortem studies (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gurevich and Joyce, 1999</xref>). Given the high affinity of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO for D3 receptors, increased binding within the amygdala is likely to indicate increased expression of D3 receptors in this region. Baseline and blockade scans using a D3-specific antagonist to quantify the relative D2 and D3 contributions to [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO signal in the amygdala would help to further disentangle the effects of TBI on D2 and D3 receptors in our patients.</p><p id="p0180">Our findings extend previous work demonstrating dopaminergic abnormalities after TBI (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Donnemiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). Animal models of TBI show that dopaminergic abnormalities are common and the behavioural consequences can be treated with dopamine re-uptake inhibitors (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, TBI frequently disrupts dopaminergic pathways through a variety of mechanisms. Focal brainstem damage can directly damage brainstem dopaminergic nuclei, and traumatic axonal injury can damage their white matter projections (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2018</xref>). The effect of these changes has consistently been observed as a reduction in DAT in the striatum after TBI (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Donnemiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). DAT is the main regulator of synaptic dopamine levels and this change is likely to be due to a compensatory down-regulation in response to reduced synaptic dopamine levels. Although we did not find evidence of axonal injury in dopaminergic projections, nigro-caudate FA was related to dopaminergic abnormalities in the caudate of TBI patients, suggesting an important role for dopaminergic projections and the compensatory changes to the dopaminergic pathways observed after TBI.</p><p id="p0185">A small number of studies on the effects of TBI on dopamine receptor distributions have been conducted but D3 receptors have not previously been investigated. Animal studies have not provided evidence for chronic changes in D2 receptors after TBI (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>). However in humans, chronic changes have been reported. Donnemiller and colleagues reported reductions of striatal D2 receptor binding using the SPECT tracer <sup>123</sup>I-IBZM in patients who also had reductions of DAT in this region (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Donnemiller et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, higher D2 receptor binding has been seen in the ventral striatum using the PET ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). Our results replicate the finding of reduced D2 receptor binding in the caudate, but also provide some evidence of variability in the effect of TBI on dopamine receptors as [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding was increased in patients without MDD in the amygdala. These results suggest multiple factors may influence levels of D2 and D3 receptors following TBI which require further exploration.</p><p id="p0190">Compensatory reductions in DAT could lead to a direct reduction in post-synaptic D2 receptors, whereas increased binding in the amygdala might be due to a compensatory upregulation of receptors in response to reduced synaptic dopamine levels. However, changes to endogenous dopamine levels might also contribute to the alterations in [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> seen in our patients without a direct relationship to receptor density changes. Reductions in DAT can increase synaptic dopamine levels following TBI. Increased synaptic dopamine levels may provide greater competition with [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO to bind to D2/D3 receptors thus leading to decreased [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> within these regions. Extending the current work to include quantification of DAT in addition to [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> would provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub>.</p><p id="p0195">Dopaminergic abnormalities caused by TBI may be related to post-traumatic depression. In keeping with this possibility, we observed patterns of [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding in patients with and without post-traumatic depression, which suggest the potential involvement of dopaminergic abnormalities in post-traumatic depression. Abnormally low [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding was only observed in TBI-MDD patients compared to controls when patients were grouped by psychiatric status, suggesting a potential role for altered dopamine function in the caudate in post-traumatic depression. In individuals with non-traumatic MDD, lower striatal DAT has been observed (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2001</xref>) whilst increases in D2 receptor binding have been associated with recovery from clinical depression over time (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Larisch et al., 1997</xref>). A relationship between dopaminergic abnormalities and depressive symptoms has also been observed in other neurological conditions. Depression is commonly seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT and D2 receptor levels are often reduced (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Vriend et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Antonini et al., 1997</xref>). Depressed patients with PD have also been shown to have significantly reduced DAT binding in the caudate compared to non-depressed PD patients (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Remy et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, in Huntington's disease (HD) (a disease associated with neuronal cell loss in the caudate (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 2005</xref>) and dopaminergic abnormalities), many patients develop depressive illness (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Paulsen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0200">TBI patients without MDD showed higher [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding in the amygdala compared to controls, which might indicate a compensatory change in D3 receptor expression that protects against the development of depression after TBI. However, this must be considered carefully given the small group sizes and no significant differences being detected between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patient groups. Nevertheless, the amygdala is widely implicated in the regulation of mood and affect. In non-TBI depressed patients, pathophysiological changes to this region have included alterations in resting glucose metabolism, volume and dopamine transmission (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Drevets, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Klimek et al., 2002</xref>). Dopamine plays an important role in the modulation of the amygdala and its response to stimuli (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Kienast et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, animal models have demonstrated that antidepressant treatments (such as tricyclic antidepressants) selectively increase D3 receptor expression (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lammers et al., 2000</xref>) and D3-receptor agonists such as pramipexole have antidepressant properties in both humans and animal models (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Willner, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 1999</xref>). It is conceivable that D3 receptor upregulation after TBI might provide similar benefits to antidepressant treatment and that measuring D2/D3 receptor levels might inform the choice of effective anti-depressant medication after TBI.</p><p id="p0205">We also found evidence for abnormalities in white matter connections within the limbic system, with more widespread damage seen in depressed patients. Diffusion abnormalities were seen in the cingulum and uncinate fasciculi bilaterally. These white matter tracts connect nodes in the limbic system and similar diffusion abnormalities in these tracts have previously been observed in patients with non-traumatic depression (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Keedwell et al., 2012</xref>). Damage to the uncinate fasciculus connections were only seen in depressed TBI patients, suggesting that damage to the connections between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala/hippocampal gyrus may be an important factor in the development of post-traumatic depression.</p><p id="p0210">There are a number of potential limitations to our work. Firstly, as expected, there was evidence of post-traumatic atrophy in some brain regions. It is possible that this might have influenced our PET results. However, this is unlikely to be a major influence on our results as there was no relationship between regional volume and binding in either the caudate or any other ROI. In addition, cerebellar SUVs were similar in the control and patient groups indicating that there was not a systematic bias between the groups in our reference regions. Secondly, we focused on studying D2/D3 dopaminergic receptors. It is possible to provide a more complete description of post-traumatic dopaminergic abnormalities and future research would benefit from measuring additional factors such as DAT levels in conjunction with [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO binding. In addition, we used an automated atlas method to derive ROIs. This process may be susceptible to noise due to misalignment in smaller subcortical regions compared to manual delineation. However, we used an advanced DARTEL registration method that has previously been used for PET data and has superior registration to earlier non-linear techniques.</p><p id="p0215">Our study had small sample sizes within our TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patient groups, which might have impacted on the power to detect differences. Hence, our findings should be viewed as preliminary evidence for the role of dopaminergic changes in TBI-MDD. We did not observe any significant differences between the two TBI groups but did identify different patterns of altered [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO BP<sub>ND</sub> when comparing each group to healthy controls. Future studies would benefit from larger group sizes to determine whether there are distinct differences between TBI-MDD and TBI-NON patients that we were underpowered to detect. This would help to further clarify whether the observed patterns of altered binding across the TBI groups are specific to psychiatric outcomes. Although the sample sizes are small between these groups, our findings suggest some potentially interesting D2/D3 regions to explore further in much larger patient groups.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0220">In conclusion, we provide evidence of altered D2/D3 receptor binding after TBI, using [<sup>11</sup>C]PHNO PET for the first time in this patient population. Patterns of D2/D3 receptor abnormalities in clinically depressed and non-depressed TBI patients varied when compared to controls. Lower caudate binding supports previous findings of D2 abnormalities after TBI (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2018</xref>) and provide a potential mechanistic link between altered dopaminergic function in the caudate and the development of post-traumatic depression. These findings are preliminary, and future research extending this work using larger sample sizes is recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Antonini</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Oertel</surname><given-names>W.H.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Pogarell</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Leenders</surname><given-names>K.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term changes of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease: a study with positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride</article-title><source>Mov.

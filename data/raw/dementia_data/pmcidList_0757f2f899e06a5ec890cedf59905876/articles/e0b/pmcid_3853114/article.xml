Specifically, post-mortem studies have shown that brain regions that are “last in,” or that myelinate later in development, are typically “first out,” or the most vulnerable to aging and the first areas to manifest neurodegenerative pathology (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak, 1996</xref>). In vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have supported this observation. DTI uses the micron-scale displacement of water to probe the microstructural integrity of brain white matter (WM) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996</xref>). Briefly, the directional variability of water diffusion in WM is indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA), where higher FA values imply greater directional coherence of WM fiber bundles. Consistent with post-mortem findings, prior studies show that compared to controls, AD patients have lower FA values in late-myelinating regions relative to early-myelinating areas (<xref rid="bb0080 bb0125 bb0215 bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Choi, 2005; Gao et al., 2011; O'Dwyer et al., 2011a; Stricker et al., 2009</xref>). While this effect could be largely attributable to myelin breakdown, conflicting observations in the larger DTI literature on AD suggest that the mechanisms and the course of these changes are likely complex and synergistic (i.e. involving both Wallerian degeneration and myelin breakdown; <xref rid="bb0215 bb0275" ref-type="bibr">O'Dwyer et al., 2011a; Sexton et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ambiguous pathogenic interpretation of these DTI results is partly due to the limited specificity of FA, which is affected by several factors such as myelination, axon density or diameter, and intravoxel incoherence of fiber orientation (<xref rid="bb0040 bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Beaulieu, 2002; Schmierer et al., 2007</xref>). In AD, gliosis as well as myelin and axonal loss may influence FA values (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Gouw et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, FA by itself is insufficient to disentangle the individual contributions of each degenerative process. Alternatively, simultaneously assessing changes in multiple diffusion indices could provide more insight into underlying AD pathology (<xref rid="bb0005 bb0045 bb0130 bb0190 bb0220 bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010; Bosch et al., 2012; Gold et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; O'Dwyer et al., 2011b; Shu et al., 2011</xref>). It has been proposed, for example, that radial diffusivity reflects myelin loss (<xref rid="bb0070 bb0170 bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Budde et al., 2008; Klawiter et al., 2011; Song et al., 2002</xref>), while axial diffusivity suggests axonal damage (<xref rid="bb0070 bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Budde et al., 2008; Song et al., 2003</xref>). Should a change in radial diffusivity, but not in axial diffusivity, be observed, one might infer that myelin loss rather than axonal damage has occurred. However, radial diffusivity has also been found to indicate axonal loss (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Klawiter et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, like FA, radial and axial diffusivities are informative, but have limited specificity to distinct neurodegenerative processes.</p><p>Furthermore, because of its assumption of Gaussian water diffusion, DTI is restricted in its ability to fully exploit all of the information available from diffusion MRI. Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a clinically feasible extension of DTI that examines the additional contribution of non-Gaussian diffusion effects known to occur in the brain as a result of its microstructural complexity (<xref rid="bb0155 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Helpern, 2010; Jensen et al., 2005</xref>). DKI provides both the diffusion and kurtosis tensors, from which all of the DTI-compatible metrics, such as the mean, radial and axial diffusivities are obtained, as well as the mean, radial and axial kurtoses, which quantify the diffusional non-Gaussianity. This added information can potentially improve the characterization of subtle tissue microstructural changes in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.</p><p>Nonetheless, such empirical diffusion measures only provide an indirect characterization of microstructure, making their physical meaning in terms of specific tissue properties uncertain. To overcome this limitation of pathological non-specificity, recent developments in the field of diffusion MRI have focused on biophysical modeling of the diffusion MRI signal to allow for more precise in vivo detection of subtle changes in biological tissue. In line with this effort, several advanced models have been proposed to interpret the diffusion MRI signal in brain WM (cf. <xref rid="bb0110 bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2011; Panagiotaki et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, our group has proposed a method that relates DKI-compatible metrics directly to WM microstructure using a specific WM model (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2011</xref>). This WM model applies to WM regions with highly aligned fiber bundles, and partitions water into two compartments, an intra-axonal space and an extra-axonal space. The fraction of diffusion MRI–visible water in the intra-axonal space represents the axonal water fraction (AWF). In addition, the diffusion metrics for the two compartments can be separately calculated. We refer to these WM model-derived parameters as WM tract integrity (WMTI) metrics, since they are most applicable to well-defined WM tracts. In addition to the AWF, the WMTI metrics include the intrinsic axonal diffusivity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>axon</sub>), the radial extra-axonal diffusivity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,⊥</sub>), and the axial extra-axonal diffusivity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,∥</sub>).</p><p>The WMTI metrics are by design more directly related to the microstructure than empirical DTI and DKI parameters. The AWF and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,⊥</sub> are sensitive to demyelination and axonal loss, whereas the axial compartment diffusivities, <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>axon</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,∥</sub>, are specifically sensitive to structural changes along the axon bundle in the intra-axonal space (e.g., due to axonal beading (<xref rid="bb0120 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2012c; Hui et al., 2012</xref>)) and in the extra-axonal space (e.g., due to gliosis, loss of oligodendrocytes, extracellular inflammation), respectively. As a result, <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>axon</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,∥</sub> are both far less sensitive to changes in myelin and axonal geometry transverse to the axon bundle, a finding that is consistent with our recent analysis of healthy human development data (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2012a</xref>). In addition, recent biophysical modeling (<xref rid="bb0100 bb0115 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2012c</xref>) suggests that the AWF may be most affected by axonal loss, while <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,⊥</sub> is most indicative of myelin integrity, with an elevated value being indicative of myelin breakdown. Currently, these are provisional interpretations that require further investigation. One such effort underway is a histological validation of these metrics in a mouse model of demyelination that is currently under review (cf. <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Falangola et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Of particular relevance to AD, we reported in a clinical study that the WMTI metrics demonstrated high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy in detecting WM changes through the course of AD (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2013</xref>). The transition from normal aging to the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) stage was characterized by increased radial extra-axonal diffusivity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,⊥</sub>), consistent with widespread myelin breakdown, whereas a decrease in AWF occurred later in the disease from aMCI to AD, as would result from a reduction in axonal density. Moreover, our initial voxelwise analysis suggested that these extra-axonal changes appeared to preferentially occur in late-myelinating tracts earlier in the disease, whereas the AWF declined in both late- and early-myelinating tracts in the later stages. Although these initial findings provide qualitative support of the vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts in AD, a quantitative analysis that explicitly compares regions previously defined as early- or late-myelinating in prior studies of cognitive aging and AD (<xref rid="bb0055 bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2012a; Stricker et al., 2009</xref>) would provide a more rigorous test of this hypothesis.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to apply WMTI metrics to clarify the tract-specific changes in WM tissue properties, using cross-sectional data from demographically similar groups of subjects that simulate the course of AD. We hypothesized that late-myelinating tracts would degenerate through the course of AD in contrast to relatively stable early-myelinating tracts, using the WMTI metrics to investigate whether these changes resulted from degeneration in axonal or myelin integrity. We further expected that these WMTI metrics in late-myelinating tracts would be associated with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function known to decline through the course of AD (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2004</xref>) and facilitated by late-myelinating regions (<xref rid="bb0065 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects and procedures</title><p>Subjects were recruited from the New York University (NYU) Alzheimer's Disease Center to undergo a full clinical research evaluation per Uniform Data Set procedures for Alzheimer's Disease Centers (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2006</xref>), and an MRI brain scan. Diagnoses were rendered by consensus and followed research criteria: NC subjects (n = 15) had no evidence of dementia or MCI and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0; aMCI subjects (n = 12) were deemed to be in the precursor stage to AD dementia as defined by having a self- and/or informant-reported memory complaint, memory impairment based on performance that was at least − 1.5 standard deviations below the Wechsler Memory Scale — Revised normative mean for age on Logical Memory-II or other memory subtests, CDR = 0.5, and no dementia (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Petersen, 2004</xref>); AD subjects (n = 14) were given a diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">McKhann et al., 1984</xref>), CDR ≥ 0.5 (range 0.5–2.0), and were not deemed to have any medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions that could otherwise account for the dementia. The three groups did not statistically differ in demographic characteristics (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nonetheless, due to the sensitivity of the WMTI metrics and diffusion MRI metrics in general (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2006</xref>) to age, age was included as a covariate in all analyses.

These findings have the following implications regarding the regional progression of WM changes in AD, and identify potential biomarkers of a neurobiological substrate of cognitive dysfunction.</p><sec id="s0055"><label>4.1</label><title>Changes in WMTI metrics reflect preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts in AD</title><p>The preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating areas to aging and AD is a proposed mechanism by which cognition declines. This trend has been referred to as “retrogenesis,” or a “return to childhood” insofar as the disease is characterized by a decline in cognitive and functional abilities that inversely mirrors the acquisition of these skills in development (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Reisberg et al., 1999</xref>). Post-mortem studies indicate that pathological markers of neurodegenerative diseases first develop in areas that are last to myelinate prior to affecting early-myelinating areas (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak, 1996</xref>), and that a loss of myelin integrity accounts for cognitive decline (<xref rid="bb0235 bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 1996; Wallin et al., 1989</xref>). Mechanistically, this occurs because when myelin breaks down with aging, the homeostatic remyelination process is characterized by the formation of thinner and shorter intermodal lengths of myelin, resulting in a reduced rate of conduction along affected myelinated nerve fibers (<xref rid="bb0095 bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Fancy et al., 2011; Peters, 2009</xref>). In vivo detection methods of this known biological process are key to the development of potential targets that could ameliorate the burden of cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases of aging. In accord with other studies (<xref rid="bb0030 bb0055 bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Bartzokis et al., 2012; Brickman et al., 2012a; Stricker et al., 2009</xref>), our study contributes to this literature by providing in vivo corroboration of known myelopathology.</p><p>Specifically, these findings support the potential use of novel WMTI metrics to clarify the particular tissue properties of WM that undergo changes through the course of AD. The results of our mixed models suggest that axonal density, what AWF is modeled to estimate, preferentially decreases in late-myelinating tracts, particularly at the later stages of AD (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). Similarly, myelin breakdown (as estimated by increased <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,⊥</sub>) in late-myelinating tracts also occurs through the course of AD, especially in the later stages when such decline likewise occurs in early-myelinating tracts (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d). Neither changes in the intra-axonal environment (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>axon</sub>; indicating axonal injury), nor in axial extra-axonal diffusivity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,∥</sub>; suggesting alterations in extra-axonal diffusivity due to gliosis, loss of oligodendrocytes, inflammation and the like), demonstrated the hypothesized pattern.</p><p>These dissociations corroborate and extend known processes in AD. First, AWF as a metric of axonal density loss may be a marker of the widespread neuronal degeneration resulting from intra-cellular neurofibrillary changes in late-myelinating areas (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak, 1996</xref>), whereas the integrity of axonal projections is relatively unaffected unlike in acute ischemia (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hui et al., 2012</xref>). While cerebrovascular disease is known to exacerbate or even precipitate AD (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Kalaria et al., 2012</xref>), further work could disentangle the extent to which WMTI metrics can reflect its acute or chronic effects on AD. Second, the specificity of our findings implicating myelin breakdown relates to previous findings from other groups. It is possible that along with neurofibrillary changes, dysregulation in the homeostatic functions of myelin is a crucial mechanism by which cognitive and functional declines arise in AD (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bartzokis, 2004</xref>). Indeed, while the mixed model for <italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>e,∥</sub> was not significant (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b), the data trends are consistent with glial activation in both late- and early-myelinating tracts through the disease course. Myelin breakdown may especially be observed in late-myelinating tracts that, given WM ontogeny, are particularly vulnerable to AD, but may also be observed later in the disease in early-myelinating tracts. For both processes of axonal density loss and myelin breakdown, the results of this study suggest that these declines are most apparent in the dementia stage, indicating that these particular WM regions may be involved in later stages of disease. However, our previously published voxelwise analyses did implicate other widespread regions, mostly late-myelinating than early-myelinating, as significantly differentiating normal controls from aMCI (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>4.2</label><title>Extra-axonal diffusivity in late-myelinating tracts and semantic verbal fluency</title><p>These previously described findings relating to degeneration in axonal density and myelin integrity in late-myelinating tracts presuppose that these changes may influence the declines in higher-order cognition that characterize the course of AD. To add to this, we identified that myelin integrity in particular (as indicated by WMTI metrics of extra-axonal diffusivity) was more specifically correlated with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function that is also known to decline in AD and is believed to be facilitated by the late-myelinating longitudinal fasciculi of interest in this study (<xref rid="bb0065 bb0075 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, not only are these WMTI metrics potentially sensitive to specific regional differences in degeneration as the disease progresses, but these metrics also are functionally relevant and can serve as potential markers of the neuroanatomical substrate of cognitive decline, which are in much need (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Salthouse, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>4.3</label><title>WMTI metrics may specifically reflect the particular vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts in AD compared to conventional diffusion metrics</title><p>The DKI acquisition implemented in this study also provides the conventional diffusion metrics via DKE post-processing. Thus, while not the focus of the current study, follow-up mixed models were conducted using the conventional diffusion metrics instead to examine the extent to which these metrics also reflect the hypothesized effects. As can be seen in Supplementary Table 2, mixed models were significant for the mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial kurtosis. Of note, mean and radial diffusivities demonstrated group differences in <italic toggle="yes">both</italic> early- and late-myelinating tracts, whereas the current findings specifically supported the hypothesized interaction effect (i.e. preferential decline in late-myelinating tracts). Although these data appear supportive of the WMTI metrics, it must be emphasized that these are suggestive trends at best due to the multiple tests conducted with the modest sample size in this preliminary study. Future replications and extensions of this work can hopefully be adequately powered to conduct more robust statistical tests of these comparative effects.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>4.4</label><title>Clinical implications and future directions</title><p>Although most typified by medial temporal atrophy and memory decline, AD is increasingly regarded as a disease that affects widespread brain tissue, as evidenced by the growing number of neuroimaging studies that implicate various other regions, tracts, and networks (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Risacher and Saykin, 2013</xref>), and the neuropsychological literature that has long documented declines in non-memory domains (e.g. semantic verbal fluency) as also pathognomonic of the disease (<xref rid="bb0010 bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 2001; Salmon et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, this study provides a demonstration of how WMTI metrics, as obtained from DKI, can indicate the microstructural integrity of key tracts associated with cognition that also undergo degeneration in the course of AD. Similar to the ease with which neuropsychological testing is implemented and yields meaningful indices, it is the intention of many developers of neuroimaging biomarkers to provide functionally meaningful quantitative metrics that can be derived from clinically-feasible imaging sequences with relatively straightforward post-processing. Given the promising findings in this preliminary study, future work incorporating complementary imaging modalities may help clarify other contributors to WM changes and cognition in AD.</p><p>These results can inform potential interventions by enabling the consideration of alternative prevention or treatment strategies that target mediators of axonal density or myelin integrity in late-myelinating regions. Considering the preferential vulnerability of these areas as shown in this study, it is possible that therapies focused on WM constituents or on the processes that perturb its homeostatic functions may provide alternative or complementary strategies for addressing this widespread brain disease that affects more than one region and involves varied pathologies (e.g. <xref rid="bb0025 bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Bartzokis, 2012; Hider et al., 2011</xref>). The field is in need of effective therapeutics that can perhaps benefit other diseases in which cognitive decline, as influenced by loss of WM integrity, is a similar problem. Subsequent research must employ experimental designs or more robust statistical analyses that directly test the association between metrics of WM integrity and cognitive function to bolster this argument.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>4.5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite the large effect sizes found here that provide in vivo corroboration of known neuropathological processes, this study has limitations. First, since the patient groups studied here represent a cross-sectional simulation of the temporal course of AD, corroboration of these findings using a longitudinal design is necessary to fully elucidate the primacy or saliency of regional differences through the course of disease (<xref rid="bb0215 bb0275" ref-type="bibr">O'Dwyer et al., 2011a; Sexton et al., 2011</xref>), although our prior findings imply that myelin breakdown may precede axonal density loss (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2013</xref>). Future clinical research must also endeavor to more thoroughly characterize the presence and potential contribution of vascular risk factors in the event that these may be meaningful effect modifiers.</p><p>Second, other WM pathologies identified via non-diffusion imaging techniques were not incorporated here. For instance, T2-weighted imaging identifies WM hyperintensities that represent a variety of pathologies that may increase the likelihood of dementia onset (<xref rid="bb0060 bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2012b; van Straaten et al., 2008</xref>). However, in our data set, the prevalence of WM hyperintensities was not statistically significantly different between the groups (cf. <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Fieremans et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the effects introduced by these hyperintensities that are not already detected by DKI would not systematically alter our results. The relative contribution of these in vivo imaging techniques to quantifying WM integrity, be it through quantifying WM hyperintensities or diffusion properties, is unknown and beyond the scope of this paper, but is currently under active investigation (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). Multi-modal neuroimaging studies incorporating WMTI metrics would be ideal, provided that this future work is sufficiently powered to incorporate various other metrics.</p><p>Third, there are many other tracts identified in recent in vivo imaging studies as either late- or early-myelinating that could have been considered here (<xref rid="bb0180 bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Kochunov et al., 2012; Lebel et al., 2012</xref>). However, given the modest sample size and the preliminary nature of this study, focusing the analyses on regions that have been identified in previous studies was considered both conceptually and practically justified. Our decision to combine the left and right regions in the analyses for the sake of consistency with prior imaging studies that hypothesized similar effects (<xref rid="bb0055 bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2012a; Stricker et al., 2009</xref>) could also bear further scrutiny in future studies, although follow-up analyses of these data reveal no significant differences between each WMTI metric of the corresponding left and right regions (data not shown). Similarly, future work can explore whether certain tracts that contributed to the composites used here were primarily driving the results. For instance, in the aforementioned studies, FA in the ILF showed greater age-related (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Brickman et al., 2012a</xref>) and AD-related (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Stricker et al., 2009</xref>) effects. We found contrasting results in that FA in the SLF appeared to distinguish the groups more so than the ILF (Supplementary Table 2), and that the tract-specific group differences did not systematically favor ILF effects across the WMTI metrics (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Regardless, replication of these findings with larger samples is necessary before any definitive conclusions can be made. Lastly, subsequent work could also further investigate the functional relevance of these metrics by employing psychometrically robust measures of cognition beyond those employed here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0080"><label>4.6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>We applied recent innovations in modeling of WM microstructure using DKI-derived parameters to demonstrate the extent to which WMTI metrics can clarify the vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts in AD.

Albeit preliminary, the large effects found in this study suggest that these metrics can potentially serve as robust in vivo biomarkers of disease progression that warrant further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Acosta-Cabronero</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>G.B.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Pengas</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Nestor</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Absolute diffusivities define the landscape of white matter degeneration in Alzheimer's disease</article-title><source>Brain</source><volume>133</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>529</fpage><lpage>539</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19914928</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1093/brain/awp257</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>M.S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Moss</surname><given-names>M.B.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Tanzi</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preclinical prediction of AD using neuropsychological tests</article-title><source>J.

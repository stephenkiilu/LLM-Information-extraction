We hypothesized that athletes with PPCS would have neurocognitive impairments and white matter abnormalities that could be revealed by advanced neuroimaging using ultra-high field strength diffusion tensor (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis (DKI) imaging metrics and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. A cohort of athletes with PPCS severity limiting the ability to work/study and participate in sport school and/or social activities for ≥6 months completed 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (morphological T1-weighed volumetry, DTI and DKI), extensive neuropsychological testing, symptom rating, and CSF biomarker sampling. Twenty-two athletes with PPCS and 22 controls were included. Concussed athletes performed below norms and significantly lower than controls on all but one of the psychometric neuropsychology tests. Supratentorial white and gray matter, as well as hippocampal volumes did not differ between concussed athletes and controls. However, of the 72 examined white matter tracts, 16% of DTI and 35% of DKI metrics (in total 28%) were significantly different between concussed athletes and controls. DKI fractional anisotropy and axial kurtosis were increased, and DKI radial diffusivity and radial kurtosis decreased in concussed athletes when compared with controls. CSF neurofilament light (NfL; an axonal injury marker), although not glial fibrillary acidic protein, correlated with several diffusion metrics. In this first 7T DTI and DKI study investigating PPCS, widespread microstructural alterations were observed in the white matter, correlating with CSF markers of axonal injury. More white matter changes were observed using DKI than using DTI. These white matter alterations may indicate persistent pathophysiological processes following concussion in sport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>neuropsychology</kwd><kwd>persistent post-concussion symptoms</kwd><kwd>7T MRI</kwd><kwd>sports-related concussion</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="83"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute symptoms following sports-related concussion (SRC) include physical, cognitive, and emotional disturbances that commonly subside within 7–14 days after injury.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, 10–30% of athletes develop persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS),<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> which include neurocognitive deficits and impaired long-term mental health and quality of life.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although there is no consensus or gold standard for the definition of PPCS, which varies among studies, the diagnosis is often based on symptom rating (e.g. using self-report rating scales) with symptoms persisting beyond the normal recovery time.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>There are growing concerns that several mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) and SRCs may initiate a long-term neurodegenerative process in the brain, associated with white matter (WM) pathology.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, often there is an absence of gross structural pathology on conventional neuroimaging.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Presumably, subtle abnormalities may be detected by advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques at higher field strengths. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an imaging technique that sensitizes the images to the microstructure of brain tissue by probing the diffusional motion of water molecules.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension to DTI that may be more sensitive to microstructural changes.

However, none of the previous DTI or DKI studies examined the use of ultra-high field strength (≥ 7T). At 7T, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of DTI are supposed to be enhanced when compared to 3T-DTI.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref></sup></p><p>Apart from imaging, there is also a vast interest in biomarkers for SRC, aimed at diagnosis, assessment of injury severity, and outcome prediction.

CSF biomarker and neuroimaging studies are required. Therefore, in the present explorative study, we evaluated the neurocognitive and mental health outcomes in athletes with SRC and PPCS for &gt;6 months, and explored measures of atrophy using 7T MRI volumetry and measures of tissue microstructure using 7T DTI and DKI. For inclusion, symptom severity should prevent participation in sports, and limit work, school, or regular social activities. We choose to include DTI and DKI metrics in all WM areas of the brain to provide a study of WM microstructure in SRC athletes to assess the additive value of ultra-high field DTI and DKI on mild TBI research.

Finally, an inspection of potential erroneous classification of WM as GM or vice versa was performed, and edits were made to the parcellation image to redraw WM and GM boundaries. In the case of B1+ inhomogeneity severely affecting the image, causing a drop in SNR, the specific subject was excluded from the morphology analysis, as none of the abovementioned steps would mitigate the issue.

De-noising was performed using Marchenko–Pastur principal component analysis.<sup><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> For mitigating Gibbs-ringing artefacts we used the method proposed by Kellner and coworkers.<sup><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Brain extraction was performed with the use of a T1-weighted brain mask that was extracted via the advanced normalization tools (ANTs) brain extraction scheme.<sup><xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Once a brain mask was extracted from the T1-weighted volume, the b-zero volume (b = 0 sec/mm<sup>2</sup> ) was rigidly registered onto the T1-weighted volume using the ANTs rigid registration scheme,<sup><xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> and then the inverse transformation matrix was used to bring the brain mask onto the DTI or DKI space.

Using 10<sup>4</sup> permutations, this generated a distribution of the number of tracts with significant differences, under the null hypothesis. The exact <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value was computed as the relative fraction for which the number of significant tracts from the permutation analysis was higher than the number of significant tracts with the true labels. Using the results of the permutation analysis, we also computed the 95th percentile of the number of tracts that was significant under the null hypothesis. This number can be considered as a significance threshold: for parameters with fewer significant tracts, all significant tracts for that parameter may be considered as false positives. For parameters with a higher number of significant tracts, some but not all of the significant tracts can be considered as false positives. The permutation analysis was repeated for significance thresholds (ɑ) in the per-tract <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> tests of 0.05 and 0.01.</p><p>Effect sizes were calculated for differences between SRC athletes and controls in the DTI and DKI metrics.

Our main findings were that despite having no gross findings on routine clinical neuroimaging, SRC athletes had marked deficits on neuropsychological functioning and showed evidence of widespread structural changes in a large proportion of WM tracts when studied by 7T DKI. Further, the axonal injury marker NfL correlated with several of the diffusion metrics. These findings indicate that advanced neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers are needed to explore the extent of WM abnormalities following SRC.</p><p>The SRC athletes had sustained a median of five SRCs, reported a high symptom burden at the time of investigation, and would meet the ICD-10 criteria for post-concussion syndrome. The symptoms included elevated ratings of depression, anxiety, and mental fatigue; subjective experiences of executive dysfunction; and impaired life satisfaction. The enrollment of the PPCS cohort could, as a result of self-selection, have introduced a bias with symptoms unrelated to SRC-induced factors but instead caused by mental health concerns. We regard this as unlikely because no elite athlete had any pre-existing mental health issues and the PPCS were continuous, without symptom-free periods post-concussion. Moreover, the causes of PPCS may be multifactorial, and psychological processes and pre-injury factors could contribute.<sup><xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> We argue that biological processes are indeed present at prolonged times post-injury, supported by recent findings from our group.<sup><xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup></p><p>Our results revealed deficits in neuropsychological functioning, particularly in the domains of immediate memory, verbal abilities, and attentional functions. Compared with controls, SRC athletes performed significantly worse on all psychometric measures except the Digit span working memory test. Several factors other than SRCs can influence perceived mental health, such as SRC-induced post-traumatic stress and not being able to continue sport participation or attend work, studies, or social events to the same extent as previously. Although other factors may contribute to mental health issues, given the extent of structural abnormalities on 7T DKI, we argue that the observed WM abnormalities may give rise to neurobiologically based dysregulation of emotional homeostasis following SRC.<sup><xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup></p><p>The microstructural alterations detected with 7T DKI in this group of symptomatic SRC athletes at an average time of 2.6 years since their last SRC suggest persisting, or even evolving neuropathology in the WM, as supported by our CSF NfL data. At the time of SRC, rotational forces cause tension in WM tracts, and this axonal stretch may lead to axonal beading,<sup><xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> which may explain increased AK.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> Axonal beading is the accumulation of varicosities along the axis of an axon, which may be caused by a tension-driven destabilization of microtubules.<sup><xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> The theory of axonal beading is further strengthened and argued for in an animal model of mTBI, where an increase in AK and MK was seen.<sup><xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Neurodegenerative processes tend to yield reduced FA. However, increased FA in SRC as observed in our present study has been observed previously. In our study we observed increased DKI FA and AK, and decreased RD and RK, which may be evidence of axonal beading, gliosis, and astrogliosis supported by a post-mortem study of athletes with previous SRCs.<sup><xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> Other mechanisms such as Wallerian degeneration, a concomitant inflammatory response, and SRC-induced neurodegeneration may also contribute.<sup><xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77–79</xref></sup> However, this needs verification by histopathological evaluation. The correlation between NfL and several DTI and DKI metrics argues for an ongoing axonal injury process rather than astrogliosis as an explanation of the altered diffusion metrics. Recently, serum NfL and GFAP levels were evaluated over several years following injury,<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and whereas NfL and GFAP correlated with WM atrophy and DTI measures of axonal injury, the prognostic utility of GFAP was inferior to that of NfL.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The correlations between diffusion metrics and the axonal injury marker NfL indicate a progressive axonal injury process. The microstructural changes found in this study were widespread in the WM and present in long tracts, central structures, and in both hemispheres, and were mainly supratentorial. In previous studies, a general pattern of abnormalities was observed,<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which was expected in view of the rotational forces causing global WM tract shearing.</p><p>In the diffusion analysis, DKI yielded higher effect sizes than DTI (see the “average rows” in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Diffusion MRI (DTI or DKI) metrics characterize alternations in WM morphology, described by water diffusivity within the WM tracts. Our results indicate that DKI is more sensitive in the evaluation of PPCS athletes than DTI; however, the merit of DKI over DTI can only be appreciated when both protocols are implemented equally. DKI is a more demanding protocol than DTI (multi-shell acquisition, higher b-values, necessitates diffusion encoding with longer gradient pulses), and therefore, DKI is performed with longer echo times than DTI, which reduces the baseline SNR ratio. This is often compensated for by reducing the spatial resolution in DKI compared with DTI. In such a case, DKI might not demonstrate any additive values compared with DTI, and to date we cannot firmly argue that DKI should replace DTI in clinical routine. A different observation when comparing DTI with DKI was reported in a study on SRC athletes, in which MD differed from DTI more extensively across the WM skeleton than any DKI parameter.<sup><xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup> A possible explanation is that the DTI protocol featured fewer diffusion encodings than the DKI protocol (36 and 52, respectively), which therefore leads to a slight disadvantage in terms of protocol performance. However, previous studies investigating what effect the number of gradient directions has on the accuracy of direction-sensitive diffusion parameters such as FA, AD, and RD showed that above a certain number of directions (∼ 25) the accuracy does not improve substantially from an increased number of encoding directions.<sup><xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the high sensitivity of DTI and DKI to detect signs of microstructural alterations in SRC, there is considerable ambiguity between studies, showing both increases and decreases in the same metrics.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref>,<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> Some of the ambiguity can probably be explained by the diversity in which metrics were acquired and analyzed and at which post-injury time points and in which populations they were evaluated. DTI and DKI metrics change over time with the pathology, and studies indicate that metrics can evolve over time, or return to normal levels.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The modalities differ in sensitivity,<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> and can be sensitive to different changes at different time points.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Most SRC studies have a male dominance or only include men,<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref></sup> and there may be important sex differences. In a previous mTBI study, significantly different DTI metrics compared with controls were only observed in symptomatic patients and not in the asymptomatic group.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similarly, a study of DTI and DKI following mTBI revealed differences to controls at 72 h and 3 months, and when stratifying based on symptoms at 3 months, symptomatic patients had signs of pathology not present in the asymptomatic group.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In another study, the risk of developing PPCS could be predicted using DTI and DKI metrics at 72 h post-injury.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Further, microstructural alterations have been shown to extend beyond symptom resolution in SRC athletes.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This is evidence of a high sensitivity to microstructural change following SRC, with impairments observed even in symptom-free athletes, and more impairments observed in athletes with prolonged symptoms. DTI and DKI, with the addition of NfL, may therefore aid in determining the neurobiological correlates, and which athletes may be at risk of prolonged symptoms.</p><sec id="s031"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study evaluates a rather small, yet highly characterized cohort of SRC athletes with PPCS ≥6 months. However, this cohort may not be representative of all SRC athletes. The discrepancies in cognitive performances between SRC athletes and our control group may have been enhanced by factors other than SRCs. Although matched by age and sex, the controls had more years of education, which is related to better psychometric performance.<sup><xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup> Still, the majority of SRC athletes in the present study demonstrated cognitive difficulties by deviating from test-specific norms. The level of education in the SRC group is consistent with the mean years of education in the United States and Sweden – from where norms are obtained. The PPCS severity may have contributed to impaired ability for higher education and therefore have contributed to the lower level of education observed in our athlete cohort.</p><p>Although CSF sampling in PPCS athletes is rare, we acknowledge the limitations caused by the small sample size and the fact that CSF sampling was not conducted in our control cohort (it was not permitted by the ethical committee). Therefore, our study may lack statistical power in detecting correlations using the CSF biomarker findings. It should be noted that our included cohort displayed a very high symptom severity and number of symptoms, although as SCAT symptoms were not obtained from our control cohort, direct comparisons cannot be made. T1-weighed imaging, DTI, and DKI may have benefited from the increased SNR at 7T. However, T1-weighted imaging at 7T is known to occasionally suffer from increased B1+ inhomogeneity with artefacts in low signal intensity regions, mainly in the temporal lobes.<sup><xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup> Such specific artefacts were present in two athletes and three controls in our study, which led to their exclusion from the volumetric analysis.</p><p>Multiple comparisons, not corrected for, may lead to a risk of statistical type II error. We acknowledge that the absence of such corrections may increase the risk of type II errors, although we argue against the differences being merely caused by false positives. First, in this exploratory study, we performed a permutation analysis that showed that the number of tracts showing significant differences between SRC athletes and controls were larger than expected from chance alone for many of the DKI parameters. Second, we introduced the single WM ROI, which also displayed significant differences across the groups. Regardless, a larger PPCS cohort could have enabled stronger conclusions, although this would have been difficult in view of the narrow inclusion criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, persistent symptoms following SRC were associated with several neurocognitive impairments as well as signs of depression, anxiety, mental fatigue, executive dysfunction, and impaired life satisfaction. We found evidence of widespread WM microstructural alterations on DKI. The correlation of WM abnormalities on DKI and CSF NfL levels, but not GFAP, points toward an important role for an ongoing axonal injury process in PPCS athletes.</p></sec><sec id="s033"><title>Transparency, Rigor, and Reproducibility Summary</title><p>The study and the analysis plan were not formally pre-registered, although the analysis plan was pre-specified in the study planning. A sample size of 40–50 subjects, SRC athletes and controls equally distributed, was planned based on the limited availability of Swedish SRC athletes meeting the strict inclusion criteria. The included sample size was 22 subjects per group (please see <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref> for further details). The licensed neuropsychologist conducting the assessments was aware of the clinical status of the subjects (SRC athletes or healthy controls) but blinded to the neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers results. Participants were unable to guess the results of their assessments, as the results were analyzed after their last clinical evaluation, whereafter the participants were informed about their neuropsychology results and provided with recommendations when appropriate. Data collection and processing of MRI data were performed by investigators unaware of relevant participants' characteristics (medical history, neuropsychology, and lumbar puncture). Data were labeled using codes linked to participant identifying information.</p><p>Because of the limited sample size and particular patient features, making it impossible to blind the data, the data analysis (statistics) was performed by investigators who were aware of relevant characteristics of the participants. Data were acquired between June 2018 and June 2020, Monday to Fridays between 7:30 and 16:30. Data were collected with subjects well rested, starting with neuropsychology, followed by MRI, with the lumbar puncture being the last procedure during the day. All data sets were analyzed at the same time using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Version 25, IBM, New York) with methods specified in the <xref rid="s002" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section.

The key inclusion criteria for PPCS varies in the literature<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> although they are typically, as in our present study, based on symptom duration and severity. The primary clinical outcome measures (PPCS symptoms, neuropsychology, DTI/DKI metrics, and blood or, as used here, CSF biomarkers) are increasingly used in this research field but may not be widely established as standards. The statistical tests used were based on the testing for normality/non-normality and sample size. Statistical analysis and review were performed by the authors (A.G., M.N., N.M.) with qualifications including specific statistical training and expertise. Correction for multiple comparison was not performed, which is described in detail in the Statistical analysis and <xref rid="s030" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref> sections.

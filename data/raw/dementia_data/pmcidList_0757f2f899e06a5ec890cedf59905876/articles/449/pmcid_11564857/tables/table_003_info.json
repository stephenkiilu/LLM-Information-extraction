{"table_id": "tb4", "table_label": "Table 4.", "table_caption": "Permutation Analysis", "table_foot": "Columns show the name of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metric with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). The permutation analysis includes 20 sports-related concussion (SRC) athletes and 21 controls for DTI, and 19 SRC athletes and 20 controls for DKI. DTI metrics are fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), and DKI metrics are FA, MD, AD, RD, mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), and radial kurtosis (RK). Three properties, the number of significant tracts (#T), p value from the permutation testing of the number of significant tracts expected under the null hypothesis, and the 95th percentile of the number of tracts that shows significant differences under the null hypothesis (i.e., the highest number of false positives expected), are shown for two different significance thresholds in the per-tract U tests, an alpha (\u0251) set to 0.05 and an \u0251 set to 0.01. Significantly differing tracts are bolded: tracts with p values under the set \u0251 and with number of differing tracts over the expected for the 95th percentile.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_003.csv"}

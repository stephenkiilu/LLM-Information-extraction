{"table_id": "tb5", "table_label": "Table 5.", "table_caption": "Correlation Analysis", "table_foot": "Spearman's correlation (rs) coefficient and p values for the correlations of neuropsychology tests (raw scores) and biomarkers with single white matter region of interest (WM ROI) values for the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics. Included metrics for correlations are fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) for DTI, and FA, MD, AD, RD, mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), and radial kurtosis (RK) for DKI. Included neuropsychology tests are the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the d2 test of attention (d2), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A) whole scale and working memory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety and depression. Biomarkers include neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). There were no significant correlations between neuropsychology tests and DTI or DKI metrics; however, NfL correlated significantly with several DTI and DKI metrics, shown in bold. Included SRC athletes in the correlation analyses are for DTI; RBANS 20, SDMT 20, d2 20, Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS) 20, BRIEF whole scale 20, BRIEF working memory 20, HADS anxiety 20, HADS depression 20, NfL 15, and GFAP 15, and for DKI; RBANS 19, SDMT 19, d2 19, MFS 19, BRIEF whole scale 19, BRIEF working memory 19, HADS anxiety 19, HADS depression 19, NfL 14, and GFAP 14.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_004.csv"}

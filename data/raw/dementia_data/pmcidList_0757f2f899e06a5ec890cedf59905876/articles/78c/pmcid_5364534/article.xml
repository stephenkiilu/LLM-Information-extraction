The full potential of whole-brain DTI, however, has not been fully exploited as studies have focused on individual microstructural indices independently. In patients with AD (n = 79), mild (MCI, n = 55) and subjective (SCI, n = 30) cognitive impairment, we applied linked independent component analysis (LICA) to model inter-subject variability across five complementary DTI measures (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial/radial/mean diffusivity, diffusion tensor mode), two crossing fiber measures estimated using a multi-compartment crossing-fiber model reflecting the volume fraction of the dominant (f1) and non-dominant (f2) diffusion orientation, and finally, connectivity density obtained from full-brain probabilistic tractography. The LICA component explaining the largest data variance was highly sensitive to disease severity (AD &lt; MCI &lt; SCI) and revealed widespread coordinated decreases in FA and f1 with increases in all diffusivity measures in AD. Additionally, it reflected regional coordinated decreases and increases in f2, mode and connectivity density, implicating bidirectional alterations of crossing fibers in the fornix, uncinate fasciculi, corpus callosum and major sensorimotor pathways. LICA yielded improved diagnostic classification performance compared to univariate region-of-interest features. Our results document coordinated WM microstructural and connectivity alterations in line with disease severity across the AD continuum.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, a devastating group of brain disorders affecting 47 million individuals globally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The insidious AD neuropathological process begins years before dementia onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and is preceded by mild cognitive impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Since disease-modifying treatments for established AD dementia have failed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the field has shifted focus towards earlier intervention with some promise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. It is currently a key priority in AD research to develop neuroimaging methods that can accurately identify individuals in the earliest clinical stages of the disease, such as the stages of subjective (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), for targeting early intervention and stratifying groups in clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Although historically primarily associated with regional gray matter (GM) loss, including medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), converging lines of evidence point to a direct role of white matter (WM) degeneration in AD pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Supporting a critical role of WM microstructure in AD, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, of which the ε4 allele polymorphism is the strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, codes for a cholesterol transporter directly involved in WM myelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion MRI) is sensitive to a range of WM characteristics, including myelin-related processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and WM diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) alterations have been included among the phenotypic signatures of APOE in non-pathological and preclinical stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Based on a multiparametric imaging study of a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, which is a hallmark of AD development, it was concluded that DTI is highly sensitive to processes preceding detectable structural and neurodegenerative processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Supporting DTI as a sensitive index of microstructural WM degeneration in AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, meta-analyses revealed converging evidence of increased mean diffusivity (MD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) with increased disease severity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, with comparable effect sizes for DTI and MTA for distinguishing AD and MCI patients from healthy controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These findings suggest that DTI may be complementary to, and as sensitive as the canonical MTA pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Still, only a few studies have tested the accuracy of diffusion MRI metrics in classifying between AD, MCI and healthy controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, whereas FA and MD are the most studied DTI indices, a range of alternative measures can be calculated, including other voxel-wise characteristics of the diffusion tensor, microstructural indices based on multi-compartment models (e.g., neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and restriction spectrum imaging (RSI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and tractography based connectivity measures. Integrated considerations of such measures provide a comprehensive description of the WM microstructural anatomy, and may yield complementary information about WM involvement in AD. For example, in an elegant and powerful study using decomposition of intra-voxel fiber orientations and probabilistic tractography, areas of crossing WM fibers were particularly vulnerable to AD, where regionally increased mode of anisotropy (MO) in AD was interpreted to reflect degree of crossing fibers and differential sparing of sensorimotor tracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>While diffusion MRI data can be used to generate a rich set of WM indices, studies combining complementary DTI measures in multivariate data fusion analysis of AD classification are lacking. Instead, most studies to date have used one or several regions of interest (ROI) or voxel-based approaches assessing one or more DTI indices in separate analyses (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> for an exception). Whereas considering different diffusion MRI metrics in independent tests may increase sensitivity compared to only considering one modality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, univariate analysis of multiple imaging indices may both be cumbersome and involve sacrificing discriminatory power due to poor modeling of shared variance between measures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we perform a comprehensive analysis fusing eight DTI based measures obtained from 164 subjects across a clinical AD continuum by means of linked independent component analysis (LICA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. LICA provides an effective way to downsample data with a vast number of voxels to a manageable number of biologically interpretable features.</p><p>The main goals were to assess the LICA features to gain new knowledge about WM patterns involved in AD and its tentative clinical precursors and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of these patterns compared to traditional approaches. Specifically, we hypothesized increased diagnostic sensitivity by efficiently modeling shared variance between complementary diffusion MRI measures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Given the hypothesized modulating role of APOE genotype status on WM microstructure and connectivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, we tested for differences between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE ε4 risk allele within and across groups, and also tested if carriers would show more AD-like WM characteristics by comparing the AD classifier’s decision probability between carriers and non-carriers in the SCI and MCI groups.</p><p>To this end, we compared our LICA results with univariate voxel-based analyses on the same dataset. We used machine learning to perform pairwise group classification to estimate the diagnostic accuracy at the individual level. We performed the same classification procedure using single metrics alone, and with the LICA features added, and compared performance across approaches. We report sensitivity and specificity for the feature showing the best performance overall to compare with current, established biomarkers of AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Main effects of diagnosis, age, sex and head coil type on subject loadings from each LICA component are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, and results for pairwise group comparison in terms of Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>.

Briefly, we obtained high classification performance of AD vs. SCI using either all LICA features together or IC0 alone (AUC = 0.80 ± 0.02, accuracy = 0.73, sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.77; AUC = 0.8 ± 0.01, accuracy = 0.70, sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.72, respectively).

While comparable results were obtained for AD vs. SCI regardless of the feature sets used, for the classification of AD vs. MCI, the LICA features provided the highest performance (AUC = 0.71 ± 0.04, accuracy = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.65, specificity = 0.67), which was considerably higher (difference in AUC values ranging from 12% to 19%) than the performance obtained using each of the ROI feature set or a combination of all of them (0.52 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.60). Using IC21 alone yielded higher performance for AD vs. MCI (AUC = 0.7) and MCI vs. SCI (AUC = 0.62), but lower performance for AD vs. SCI (AUC = 0.55) compared to using the ROI features. Furthermore, adding LICA features to the ROI feature set boosted the performance with an improvement ranging from 10% to 17% in AUC values. For the classification of MCI vs. SCI, except IC0 that showed a modest performance (AUC = 0.63, accuracy = 0.57, sensitivity = 0.55, specificity = 0.62), all other feature sets or their combinations resulted in lower performance (0.54 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.58).</p><p>When comparing the classification probability obtained using all LICA features, for the classification of AD vs. MCI, the results show a trend that MCI non-carriers of APOE ε4 (n = 23) were given a higher probability of being correctly classified as MCI than the carriers (n = 18, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.55, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 1.62, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.12, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).

Here, by fusing eight complementary diffusion MRI metrics of WM anisotropy, diffusivity and connectivity, we identified distinct multimodal WM patterns showing high sensitivity to AD. The primary component, which explained almost 50% of variance in the data captured covariance patterns of all metrics included. The anatomical distribution of this mode of variation is overlapping with previous DTI studies employing univariate approaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and with our results obtained from univariate analysis of the same sample. Importantly, the primary LICA component (IC0) captured a more spatially widespread and bidirectional pattern and yielded greater effect sizes and higher group classification accuracy than conventional ROI based analyses from the same data set, suggesting that LICA is a sensitive approach to the study of WM differences in patient cohorts including AD. IC0 captured the common variance across all eight diffusion MRI measures, reflecting a combination of global and regional WM microstructural and connectivity characteristics. Diffusivity measures (L1, RD, MD), which contributed in total 33% of the overall component weight, reflected a global pattern of increasing diffusivity with advancing cognitive impairment (AD &gt; MCI &gt; SCI), which corresponds with previous meta-analyses of DTI studies in AD and MCI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the unidirectional diffusivity pattern discussed above, the measures of anisotropy (FA, MO) showed bidirectional patterns. First, we observed a familiar pattern of large-scale decreased anisotropy, in line with results from conventional voxel-wise analyses of DTI maps from the same dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>), and previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Second, IC0 also included regions of increased anisotropy (FA, MO) in AD. The pattern of increased FA and MO was largely seen in areas encompassing projection fibers, which is remarkably consistent with previous findings of increased anisotropy in regions of crossing association and projecting fibers in AD and MCI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Visual inspection of the distribution of the different diffusion MRI measures in the present component corroborated this finding by showing relative sparing of the dominant fiber direction (f1) in a region indicating increased FA in AD and MCI, encompassing both probabilistic atlas renderings of the corticospinal tract and the superior longitudinal fasciculus.</p><p>IC0 also involved CDM (5% weight contribution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which provided a unique feature of WM connectivity based on full brain voxel-wise probabilistic tractography based on a crossing-fiber model. The CDM pattern was also bidirectional showing both increased and decreased connectivity probability in AD. Specifically, we observed reduced connection density in AD in association pathways with known involvement in the disease, including the fornices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and the uncinate fasciculi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The same pattern was also seen in the genu of the corpus callosum. Conversely, a pattern of increased connection density in AD (AD &gt; MCI &gt; SCI) was restricted to projection pathways, following motor-related pathways including corticospinal tracts bilaterally. We interpret the focal pattern of increased CDM in AD seen here as further support of relative sparing of projecting fibers in early AD and MCI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and may lend support to the retrogenesis model of AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although there is much debate on the pathophysiology underlying AD-related WM changes, the retrogenesis hypothesis states that oligodendrocytes and myelin homeostasis are viewed as upstream players in aging and AD-related cognitive decline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. According to the model, later-myelinating neurons such as those of limbic association pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, are more susceptible to environmental and metabolic insults compared with tracts that myelinate early in ontogeny, such as the corticospinal pathways. In line with this model, Stricker <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. found reduced FA in late-myelinating regions within the corpus callosum and in the body of the corpus callosum in MCI compared to healthy elderly controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our finding of greater FA reductions and RD increases in AD in the genu of the corpus callosum as compared to the splenium (may be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, axial views), also fits with retrogenesis theory, although our study was not designed to evaluate neurobiological properties underlying the diffusion MRI metrics.</p><p>The many shared features of AD and normal aging remains a challenge in brain imaging studies of AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Identification of patterns unrelated to chronological age would be beneficial for better classifying patients with the disease. Interestingly, LICA identified a disease-related independent component (IC21) encompassing anterior callosal and internal capsule connection density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>), which was essentially age-independent. IC21 classified well between AD and MCI patients, and interestingly showed no relationship with SCI. We speculate that the pattern of IC21 could be interpreted as AD patients depending more heavily on preserved white matter tracts, such as bihemispheric frontal connections and projecting fibers as opposed to more affected, e.g., limbic systems. Increased internal capsule connectivity in AD fits well with the consistent sparing of this tract in AD found in DTI meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Considering all LICA features combined, we observed fairly good performance for the classification between AD and SCI (AUC = 0.80). This performance is comparable if not higher than that obtained using ROI features obtained from the individual measures. Furthermore, LICA features outperformed all ROI feature sets in terms of classification between AD and MCI, and adding LICA features to the ROI feature sets boosted the classification performance (from 10% to 17% increase in AUC value). This indicates that data-driven fusion of multiple diffusion MRI metrics using LICA produces features that are not only biologically interpretable, but also shows increased sensitivity to the differences between AD and MCI. It is also worth noting that such an increased performance in discriminating AD vs. MCI was obtained while maintaining a comparable and high sensitivity for AD vs. SCI with regard to the univariate ROI features. Classification between MCI and SCI was at chance level using either all LICA features or each of the ROI feature sets, although still with the highest yet modest performance obtained by using IC0 as the only feature (AUC = 0.63). The low classification accuracy for MCI vs. SCI is in line with the considerable overlap of demographic and cognitive variables for these two groups.</p><p>MCI APOE ε4 carriers were more likely to be classified as AD than MCI non-carriers, and vice versa, AD non-carriers were more likely to be classified as MCI than AD carriers, although only at a trend level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). This finding indicates that MCI carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, who are likely at increased risk of progressing to AD compared to their ε4 non-carrier counterparts, also show increased AD-related WM alterations compared to the non-carriers. Further, permutation testing showed that adding APOE ε4 status significantly improved classification performance of AD vs. MCI and SCI. These results may support earlier reports of altered WM microstructure, e.g., reduced FA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and increased MD as well as RD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, in ε4 carriers relative to non-carriers, and supports that APOE ε4 is associated with characteristic AD-like biomarker profiles also in healthy and sub-clinical populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, since the carriers on average were older than the non-carriers within MCI, we emphasize that these results should be interpreted with caution since we cannot fully rule out the confounding effect of age on the results, and further verification in larger, age-matched samples is needed.</p><p>Although no previous diffusion MRI study has assessed classification performance on a clinical sample including SCI patients, comparable performance for FA and MD (AUC = 0.79 and 0.83, respectively) has been reported when classifying AD patients and healthy controls using a unimodal approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In another study which classified 14 amyloid-positive AD patients and 14 closely matched healthy controls, the authors obtained an AUC of 0.87 for five DTI measures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, which is higher than the present performance.</p><p>When comparing the present results to previous literature, it should be noted that instead of a healthy control group we recruited SCI patients from a memory clinic as a reference group for comparison with AD and MCI. SCI might be a harbinger of early AD pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and our SCI sample likely differ from normal controls without subjective memory problems, potentially contributing to lower classification accuracy than one would obtain from studying a healthy convenience sample.</p><p>Among the strengths of our study is the inclusion of naturalistic sample of memory clinic patients with SCI, MCI, and AD, which enabled us to assess common and unique features across a clinically defined dementia/AD spectrum in a relevant setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest diffusion MRI study comparing SCI, MCI and AD dementia patients. Further, the use of LICA allowed us to simultaneously model global and local independent effects across different complementary WM microstructural and connectivity measures, including sensitive indices of crossing fibers and tractography based structural connectivity, which provided a novel view of WM structure in dementia. Since a main advantage of LICA is the ability to model shared variance across different measures, the derived components may show increased sensitivity to an effect of interest, especially in the case when the effect is subtle and present across different measures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. This is strongly demonstrated by the increased sensitivity in differentiating AD and MCI offered by the LICA features in the present study.</p><p>There are limitations that should be taken into account. According to cortical disconnection theory of aging, WM deterioration including myelin-breakdown, has a mediating role in cognitive decline associated with advancing age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. When evaluating disease-related differences associated with cognitive decline in the elderly—for instance between MCI and AD—comparable age groups may reduce confounding. Here, the AD group was not perfectly age-matched with the other groups, making it difficult to completely rule out effects of age in the group comparisons, although age was covaried in the univariate analyses and accounted for by using the residualized features in classification. Since age is the single most important risk factor for AD, the slightly higher age in the AD group is not surprising. Follow-up studies are needed to assess the value for predicting clinical conversion in MCI and SCI patients, and to better disentangle the spurious relationship between healthy and pathological aging. Also, due to the naturalistic setting of recruitment, age-matched controls without memory complaints were not available for the present study. Future research should address the usefulness of LICA on diffusion MRI measures in discriminating the earliest stages of cognitive impairment (e.g., SCI and MCI) from normal controls in the same age range, preferably in a longitudinal setting.</p><p>Two different head coils were used during acquisition, which may lead to unwanted source of MRI signal variation. However, the effects of head coil on the WM measures were largely accounted for by one component (IC3), leaving the remaining components largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). This result provided empirical evidence on the ability of LICA to model and isolate the effect of MR hardware discrepancy into a limited set of independent components.</p><p>Another limitation is that we included diffusion MRI data only with a focus on multivariate characterization of WM microstructure and connectivity. LICA however is able to fuse data across MR imaging modalities, and more research is needed in order to assess whether including other indices of AD-related pathology such as amyloid positron emission tomography, cortical and subcortical morphometry could reveal novel multimodal AD patterns and improve classification. Furthermore, we used diffusion measures derived using standard single-shell diffusion weighted imaging. Whereas these measures have been suggested as sensitive features of WM microstructure, changes in their values may not be attributed to changes in specific tissue microstructure substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. NODDI and RSI are complementary approaches based on multi-compartment models of diffusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and may provide microstructural indices with higher specificity compared to conventional diffusion MRI metrics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, the application of such multi-compartment models on the single-shell data included in this study, although technically feasible<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, is suboptimal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and future work should strongly consider additionally including complementary diffusion measures derived using multiple-shell diffusion MRI data.</p><p>Lastly, whereas the diagnostics workup was performed by experienced physicians according to research criteria and a comprehensive standardized protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, the clinical and biological phenotyping (e.g., amyloid and tau status) was limited. Further studies are needed to test for associations with a more complete range of biological, clinical and cognitive phenotypes.</p><p>By means of advanced diffusion MRI analysis, we report a multivariate pattern encompassing a wide range of WM microstructural and connectivity information. The data-driven approach revealed a spatial pattern which was highly sensitive to diagnostic status—outperforming a conventional approach to imaging analysis in terms of effect sizes and group classification performance. The results obtained from our novel combination of complementary diffusion MRI metrics strengthen the view that the pathophysiological processes in the AD spectrum are associated with WM structural aberrations with a magnitude closely reflecting clinical severity. Further, we have demonstrated that LICA identifies biological and clinical relevant brain features in a neurodegenerative context, and we argue that future studies should aim to employ multivariate analysis such as LICA as a way to improve AD biomarker development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participant recruitment and screening</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> summarizes demographic and clinical information.

In particular, for the classification between AD and MCI, within each group, we compared the ε4 carriers and non-carriers in terms of the probability of being assigned the correct group label, as well as the proportion of the misclassified subjects using GLM, accounting for age, sex and head coil. The same analysis was performed for the classification AD vs. SCI.</p><p>Lastly, on the subset for which both imaging data and APOE ε4 information were available, we performed pairwise group classification with APOE ε4 status included as an additional feature and used permutation testing with 10000 iterations to evaluate if the performance was improved when additionally using the genetic feature in combination with the imaging-based LICA features (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">SI</xref> for details).</p><p>LICA decomposition was performed in Matlab (version R2014a). All statistical and machine learning analyses were performed in R (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</ext-link>, version 3.2.1).

For the pairwise group comparisons of the LICA features, we corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure (multiplying the p-value by a factor of 72).

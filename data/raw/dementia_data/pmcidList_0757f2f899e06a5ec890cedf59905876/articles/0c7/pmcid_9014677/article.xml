pressure pulsatility (PP). We used data from the UK Biobank cohort study to
determine the relative importance of MAP versus PP driving white matter injury
within individual white matter tracts, particularly in the anterior and
posterior vascular territory. The associations between blood pressure and
diffusion indices in 27 major tracts were analysed using unadjusted and
fully-adjusted general linear models and mixed-effect linear models. Blood
pressure and neuroimaging data were available for 37,041 participants (mean age
64+/−7.5 years, 53% female). In unadjusted analyses, MAP and PP were similarly
associated with diffusion indices in the anterior circulation. In the posterior
circulation, the associations were weaker, particularly for MAP. In
fully-adjusted analyses, MAP remained associated with all diffusion indices in
the anterior circulation, independently of age. In the posterior circulation,
the effect of MAP became protective. PP remained associated with greater mean
diffusivity and extracellular free water diffusion in the anterior circulation
and all diffusion indices in the posterior circulation. There was a significant
interaction between PP and age. This implies discordant mechanisms for chronic
white matter injury in different brain regions and potentially in the associated
stroke risks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Small vessel disease</kwd><kwd>mean arterial blood pressure</kwd><kwd>pulse pressure</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>white matter hyperintensities</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)</kwd><kwd>neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-0271678X211058803"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with an increased risk of stroke,<sup>

changes are strongly associated with an increase in both systolic and diastolic
blood pressure represented by mean arterial blood pressure and reflecting the
steady-state component of the blood flow; however, later in life the effect depends
on the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure corresponding to
the pulsatility of the blood flow.<sup>

</sup> However, the effect of blood pressure on white matter integrity may vary
across the brain regions due to differences in the location of white matter tracts
relative to vascular supply and watershed regions. In particular, the importance of
differences in blood pressure and its pulsatility between the anterior and posterior
cerebrovascular circulation due to the damping effect of the blood pressure at the
level of the carotid siphon<sup>

anterior and posterior circulation may require adaptation of treatment to prevent
future stroke and progression of white matter injury depending on the location of
small vessel disease in individual patients.</p><p>Macrostructural white matter injury manifests as lacunar strokes, white matter

pressure (PP) calculated from the automated systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)
blood pressure measures. In the UK Biobank, blood pressure was measured twice by
trained nurses after the participant had been at rest for at least 5 minutes in
the seated position with a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron 705 IT; OMRON
Healthcare Europe B.V., Hoofddorp, Netherlands) with a suitably sized cuff. When
automated blood pressure values were not available, manual blood pressure was
used, and when it also was missing, values from Pulsewave Analysis (PWA) were
used. Measures of SBP and DBP were averaged within a visit.</p><p>As diffusion measures are affected by white matter lesions, the volume of white

continuous variables were centred and scaled before being entered into
regression analyses. The effect of MAP and PP on DTI and NODDI dMRI measures
within individual white matter tracts was analysed with sequential addition of
covariates to assess the impact of adjustment, first, using unadjusted models
(dMRI ∼ PP or dMRI ∼ MAP), then, after adjusting for age and sex
(dMRI ∼ PP + age + sex OR dMRI ∼ MAP + age + sex), and, finally, after adjusting
for the other blood pressure measures and cardiovascular risk factors
(dMRI ∼ MAP + PP + age + sex + smoking + diabetes + antihypertensives + BPmeasure + centre).
The same covariates were included in all the multivariable models. The effects
were also investigated using mixed-effects models, where we had to allow for
random effects due to multiple regions being included from the same individual
(dMRI ∼ circulation + age + sex + MAP + PP + antihypertensives + smoking + diabetes + BPmeasure + centre + antihypertensives:
MAP + antihypertensives:PP + age:MAP + age:PP + circulation:PP + circulation:MAP + (1|eid) + (1|roi)).</p><p>The effect of MAP and PP on DTI and NODDI dMRI measures within individual WM
tracts was analysed, first, using unadjusted models, then, after adjusting for
age and sex, and, finally, after adjusting for the other blood pressure measure,
age, sex, WMH load, smoking status, diagnosis of diabetes, the source of blood
pressure measurement, and an assessment centre. All modelling was performed
using the concurrent explanatory variables, i.e. acquired at the same time as
the MRI. Standardised coefficients between the dMRI measures and blood pressure
were presented in tables, forest plots, and brain maps. The tables and plots
summarised both, left and right hemisphere tracts together whereas the maps
presented standardised coefficients for MAP and PP within each white matter
tract separately. On the brain maps and forest plots, the strength of
associations was represented on a saturation scale with red corresponding to
positive associations, and blue to negative associations; for the interactions
that did not reach significance the coefficients were set to zero and rendered
as white. In the forest plots, the WM tracts were presented in the
superior/anterior to inferior/posterior order.</p><p>The analyses were also stratified by age decade (&lt;60, 60–70, ≥70) and tertiles
of WMH load. In order to investigate the interactions between age and blood
pressure and the effect of vascular territory on dMRI, a mixed-effect analysis
was performed using participants and tracts as fixed factors, and adding a
binary variable encoding whether a tract was within the anterior or posterior
circulation; the analysis was stratified by tertiles of WMH load. The tracts
supplied predominantly by the posterior circulation included: splenium of the
corpus callosum, the hippocampal part of the cingulum, cerebral peduncle,
corticospinal tract, pontine crossing tract, medial lemniscus, inferior, middle,
and superior cerebellar peduncle. Analysed tracts and used abbreviations are
presented in Supplementary Figure 1 and the list of abbreviations.</p><p>Modelling assumptions were checked using diagnostic plots of residuals.

represented by PP were both associated with microstructural white matter damage,
independent of age and the extent of macrostructural white matter damage represented
by WMH load. While MAP was associated with all analysed DTI and NODDI markers, both
reflecting neurite density and organisation (FA, ICVF, OD) and overall diffusion and
free water fraction (MD, ISOVF), PP was predominantly associated with the latter (MD
and ISOVF). However, PP was most markedly associated with white matter injury in the
posterior circulation for all indices after adjustment for MAP, except for higher
neurite density in the brainstem’s long tracts, whereas MAP was generally protective
against white matter injury in the posterior circulation regions, after adjustment
for pulsatility and other confounders.</p><p>High blood pressure pulsatility is related to lacunar infarcts<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

posterior cerebrovascular circulation and white matter injury is well less established.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr23-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

<xref rid="bibr24-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

inferior/posterior regions are less common<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> and diffusion imaging changes within the posterior circulation have not been
extensively investigated. However, infratentorial cerebral microbleeds, but not
lobar cerebral microbleeds, were associated with higher arterial stiffness<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> whilst infratentorial aneurysms tend to have a higher rupture risk than
anterior circulation aneurysms due to higher flow rates due to the lack of
protective effect of the carotid siphon.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr27-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> This reflects anatomical and physiological differences between the anterior
and posterior circulation, with likely less damping and more pulsatile blood flow
due to longer and straighter cerebral vessels, which may be more vulnerable to
stiffening with age;<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> therefore, high PP may be more relevant to post circulation injury due to a
greater risk of hypoperfusion and greater shear stress.</p><p>The association between MAP and white matter injury within the anterior circulation
was stronger in older people and with an increase in WMH load, and WMH load
confounded the interactions between dMRI with age. For example, the associations
between MAP and reduced microstructural damage in the posterior circulation were
present regardless of WMH load, and diminished with age, but the strong effect of
MAP on MD and ICVF within the anterior circulation was attenuated in people in the
lowest tertile of WMH load within their age decade. Age was strongly associated with
all indices of white matter injury, to a greater extent than blood pressure, but
whereas associations with MAP were independent of age and did not interact, PP
interacted with age to enhance the association between age and MD or ICVF.
Therefore, the observed changes may reflect processes observed in healthy ageing<sup>

<xref rid="bibr9-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

WMH load, which suggests that most of the dMRI changes represent pathological
processes that are independent of age-related and macrostructural changes.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although
antihypertensive use was associated with greater white matter injury for most
indices, regardless of WMH load, there were no interactions with blood pressure,
except for the interaction between PP and ICVF in the absence of WMH. This suggests
that microstructural damage appears early in the course of hypertension and persists
even if blood pressure is successfully controlled.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr31-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup> dMRI measures are potentially useful as an early biomarker of SVD as MD in
normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients with SVD correlated with a decline
in cognitive performance<sup>
<xref rid="bibr32-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</sup> as well as physical function.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup> The current analysis of the effect of blood pressure on the individual white
matter tracts demonstrated that the negative effect of MAP on white matter integrity
was most marked within the anterior circulation. MAP was associated with reduced
tract anisotropy (FA) and neurite density (ICVF), indicating damage to the integrity
of white matter tracts and with an increase in overall diffusivity (MD) and free
water fraction (ISOVF) suggesting demyelination.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr34-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</sup> In the posterior circulation, MAP was associated with reduced microstructural
injury, represented by higher neurite density (ICVF) and lower MD, but the increase
in FA and reduction in ISOVF were less consistent across the posterior white matter
tracts. However, MAP seemed to be linked to higher neurite orientation dispersion
(OD) within the posterior circulation. In contrast, PP was not associated with white
matter injury markers of intracellular neurite density and orientation (FA, ICVF,
OD), but only with markers dominated by extracellular free water (MD, ISOVF). The
effect of PP was independent of WMH severity, but it enhanced the negative effect of
age on MD and the extracellular compartment diffusion fraction (ISOVF). The regional
differences in the effects of the steady and pulsatile component of blood pressure
may explain why earlier studies suggested that dMRI changes reflect axonal loss and gliosis,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> axonal loss or dysfunction,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> reduction of white matter fibre organisation<sup>
<xref rid="bibr35-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
</sup> or an increase in free water due to oedema and demyelination without changes
in the tissue compartment<sup>
<xref rid="bibr34-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</sup> or due to plasma extravasation.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr36-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</sup></p><p>The study has several strengths. Firstly, it is based on a large cohort of
middle-aged community-based participants. Secondly, the study included not only
normotensive and hypertensive people, but also those with mildly elevated blood
pressure and with controlled hypertension, which are less often studied. Another
advantage of this analysis is, that unlike earlier studies,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr30-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</sup> it included both DTI and NODDI measures within individual white matter
tracts, which made it possible to assess the interactions between MAP and PP and
microstructural white matter integrity within specific anatomical regions and to
compare the effect between the regions within the anterior and posterior cerebral
circulation. Mixed effect modelling allowed us to investigate the association with
blood pressure accounting for the differences between different types of tracts and
for the different effect of WMH load.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. Firstly, dMRI
values included measures both from WMH lesions and NAWM. This might have potentially
confounded the analysis and limited interpretation of the results, because, although
high blood pressure is associated with dMRI changes in all white matter, they may be
different in WMH and NAWM.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup>,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr37-0271678X211058803" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</sup> However, analyses in patients in the bottom tertile of WMH load confirmed the
main findings. Secondly, the automated method for WMH segmentation only results in
estimates for cerebral white matter; therefore, an effect of infratentorial WMH on
dMRI within the posterior circulation could not be investigated. As this study was
based on reported mean dMRI values rather than diffusion images, there was no
additional correction for susceptibility and pulsatile motion artefacts, which might
have particularly affected inferior/posterior regions overlapping with the posterior
circulation. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of this study did not allow us to
investigate the causal relationship between blood pressure and dMRI changes. In
addition, the information regarding blood pressure lowering medication in the UK
Biobank is based on self-reported data, with limited information available to
investigate interactions between specific clasess of antihypertensives and
cerebrovascular dynamics. Finally, the brachial pulse pressure used in this present
study may not reflect intracranial arterial pulsatility.<sup>

were associated with microstructural white matter damage even in regions that are

results showed that dMRI provides a way to study detailed microstructural changes
and to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the development of white

chronic white matter injury and may therefore reflect differences in the associated

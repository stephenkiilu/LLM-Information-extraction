Serum total homocysteine level is associated with vascular risk factors such as hypertension, current smoking, previous cardiovascular disease, which are the composition items of the Framingham stroke risk profile [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Previous research suggests that there is a relationship between elevated homocysteine levels and brain morphological factors derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as brain atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], reduced white matter (WM) volume [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and WM hyperintensity (WMH) abnormalities [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Since such microstructural relationships may provide early and sensitive indicators of tissue abnormalities before the manifestation of gross morphological changes, we performed a baseline, cross-sectional study to explore the association between homocysteine level and WM microstructural organization in a large cohort of 338 healthy adults. To this end, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] data were acquired from an ethnically homogenous Asian population, in which subjects were carefully screened for medical and neurological conditions minimizing sources of variation that could affect the sensitivity of our imaging findings.

In total, 357 participants, aged 25–81 years, received detailed examinations, including physical and bed-side neurological examinations performed by neurologists, a biochemistry study, a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and MRI scans. The blood tests included the assessment of hemoglobulin (Hb), mean cell volume, fasting glucose, creatinine, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), and total level of homocysteine. All participants were asked to fast overnight (≥ 8 hours) before blood samples were taken. The blood samples were analyzed using colorimetry by an automatic chemistry analyzer in an approved laboratory (UniCel DxC 800; Beckman Coulter). The level of homocysteine was determined with a standardized chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) using the ARCHITECT <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).

The median ARWMC-total score is 0 (range: 0–8) and only twenty participants (5.8%) have an ARWMC-total score larger than 2, which reflects the beginning confluence of WM lesions at that particular brain region.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0116330.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116330.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Characteristic of the study participants (N = 338).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0116330.t001g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0116330.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age in years, mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.6 (10.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age ≥ 65 years, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (10.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">140 (41.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current smoker, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69 (20.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypertension, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80 (23.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes mellitus, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 (10.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">History of cardiovascular disease, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (4.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EKG-atrial fibrillation, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EKG-LVH, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (7.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FSRP score (%), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.9 (5.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systolic BP (mm Hg), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121.5 (20.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diastolic BP (mm Hg), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.3 (11.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.2 (3.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hb (gm/dl), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.5 (1.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fasting blood glucose (mg/dl), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">93.9 (18.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">hs-CRP (mg/dl), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3 (0.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total homocysteine (μmol /L), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.6 (2.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Creatinine (mg/dl), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8 (0.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARWMC-total score, median</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MRI volumetric measures</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FA, mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.26 (0.01)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MD (x10<sup>–5</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.8 (3.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AD (x10<sup>–5</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">97.7 (4.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TD (x10<sup>–5</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s), mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5 (2.9)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>EKG: electrocardiogram; LVH: left ventricular hypertrophy; FSRP: Framingham Stroke Risk Profile; BP: blood pressure; BMI: body mass index; Hb: hemoglobin; hs-CRP: high-sensitive C-reactive protein; ARWMC: Age-related WM changes; FA: fractional anisotropy; MD: mean diffusivity; AD: axial diffusivity; TD: transverse diffusivity.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Pairwise correlations between age, gender, BMI, FSRP score, total level of homocysteine, hs-CRP, Hb, creatinine and ARWMC-total score are shown in <xref rid="pone.0116330.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

Compared to the more widely used morphological and volumetric analyses for studying <italic toggle="yes">macrostructural</italic> brain changes (based on T1-weighted MRI), we used DTI based analyses to probe the <italic toggle="yes">microstructural</italic> tissue properties. In our study design, we carefully controlled for numerous potentially confounding factors such as age, various vascular risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, cardiovascular events history, and EKG features), and cerebral WMH scores.</p><p>This is the first study in humans that investigated the association between brain tissue properties derived from DTI and the level of homocysteine. To the best of our knowledge, only one animal study has been performed that has explored this relationship before. In that recent animal study, Willette et al. demonstrated that higher homocysteine levels are associated with lower WM volumes in the pons and the middle cerebellar peduncle, and that higher homocysteine levels have a positive association with the MD in the bilateral anterior cerebellum and the prefrontal regions [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. They also showed that homocysteine has a significant negative correlation with the FA in the cerebellar WM immediately dorsal to the forth ventricle, which is related to the pontocerebellar fibers. Our findings are in line with their results inasmuch as the MD in the bilateral frontal WM, midbrain, middle cerebellar pedundles, and pons showing a significant positive correlation with the level of homocysteine. More specifically, from VBA analyses, our results demonstrate that the increased MD in the bilateral temporal WM and brain stem regions was mainly caused by an increase in the AD rather than the TD, even when adjusting for multiple vascular risk factors.</p><p>While elevated homocysteine levels have been reported in obsessive-compulsive disorder [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], first-episode psychosis [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and Alzheimer’s dementia [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], no direct link with microstructural properties of the fiber tracts involved has been made previously. In this work, however even within a healthy cohort population, there were significant associations between diffusion metrics and homocysteine levels for the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the ponto-cerebellar tracts, the forceps minor, and the pyramidal tracts. As these findings represent a baseline reference, it can bring unique insight into the neural substrate of brain disorders.</p><p>The biological interpretation of why diffusivity changes are related to homocysteine is far from trivial. In general, diffusion rates are larger if the coherence of tissue organization is compromised. With previous literature indicating that (i) homocysteine can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter leading to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and neuronal injury [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and (ii) homocysteine is associated with axonal demyelination in periventricular and subcortical WM through the injury of oligodendrocytes [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it is plausible that the observed diffusivity increases were caused by such mechanism of axonal degeneration/injury rather than demyelination [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although hs-CRP and homocysteine are both chronic low-grade inflammation markers [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], only homocysteine showed a significant association in this work, suggesting that homocysteine would have a more specific association with regional cerebral WM microstructural properties than hs-CRP. As such, future studies may benefit from including other inflammation markers such as cytokines to further increase the specificity of regional findings.</p><p>Previous work relating macrostructural brain properties with level of homocysteine showed that homocysteine levels are higher with increased WM atrophy or with higher levels of WMH scores [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this work, we do not find a significant association between homocysteine and WMH scores after adjusting for multiple covariates. This observation can be attributed to the fact that the subjects included in this work are relatively young compared to other investigations, and that their average level of homocysteine is relatively low.</p><p>There are several methodological considerations in this study. The first one is the cross-sectional nature of our study design. Given that we measured the level of homocysteine only at one time point, we cannot demonstrate any causal effects of homocysteine on brain structure. Secondly, we did not measure the folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels of our subjects. Previous work suggests that these measures may modulate the association between homocysteine and structural brain properties and, therefore, should be used as covariates during statistical analysis [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, our participants did not have any history of medical illness, and with a mean hemoglobin equal to 14 mg/dl and the mean volume of red blood cells volume equal to 90 fl, a deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folate is likely to be absent for the majority of our participants. Furthermore, given that several other studies did not adjust for folate and vitamen B<sub>12</sub> levels and still found an association between homocysteine level and structural brain properties [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it is likely that homocysteine can still genuinely affect the WM microstructure [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Finally, it should be clear that DTI does not provide direct measures of “WM integrity” (e.g., see recent reviews by [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Although DTI is sensitive to microstructural changes, its measures are heavily affected by partial voluming [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116330.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and “crossing fibers” [<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116330.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which makes it difficult to interpret the results in an unambiguous way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that DTI is sufficiently sensitive to detect associations between homocysteine levels and diffusivity metrics in healthy subjects.

Notwithstanding the methodological benefit, the clinical relevance of CSD based FT for the assessment of white matter abnormalities remains unclear. In this work, we evaluated the applicability of a hybrid framework, in which CSD based FT is combined with conventional DTI metrics to assess white matter abnormalities in 25 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. Both CSD and DTI based FT were used to reconstruct two white matter tracts: one with regions of “crossing fibers,” i.e., the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and one which contains only one fiber orientation, i.e. the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum (CC). The DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), obtained from these tracts were related to memory function. Our results show that in the tract with “crossing fibers” the relation between FA/MD and memory was stronger with CSD than with DTI based FT. By contrast, in the fiber bundle where one fiber population predominates, the relation between FA/MD and memory was comparable between both tractography methods. Importantly, these associations were most pronounced after adjustment for the planar diffusion coefficient, a measure reflecting the degree of fiber organization complexity. These findings indicate that compared to conventionally applied DTI based FT, CSD based FT combined with DTI metrics can increase the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in tracts with complex white matter architecture.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research of GJB is supported by a high potential grant from Utrecht University and VIDI grant 91711384 from ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.

The common second-rank diffusion tensor model, however, is based on the assumption of Gaussian diffusion, which may not be valid in white matter voxels that contain so-called “crossing fibers” <xref rid="pone.0044074-Jeurissen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, i.e. complex fiber bundle architecture within a single voxel including two or more crossing, interdigitating or “kissing” fiber populations, or one fiber population with a bending or splaying architecture.</p><p>In the past decade, several advanced approaches for characterizing the intra-voxel diffusion profile have been developed to overcome the limitations of the second-rank diffusion tensor model <xref rid="pone.0044074-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0044074-Tuch2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. One of these techniques, constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) <xref rid="pone.0044074-Tournier3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, is especially promising as it can offer a reliable reconstruction of multiple fiber orientation distributions within clinically feasible MR acquisition settings <xref rid="pone.0044074-Tournier2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Notwithstanding the promising outlook, the CSD model has not yet been applied quantitatively to clinical populations due to the lack of robust diffusion metrics that can describe the underlying microstructure unambiguously.</p><p>We hypothesize that if CSD based FT is more accurate in reconstructing fiber bundle trajectories in regions with “crossing fibers”, it should be more sensitive to microstructural abnormalities underlying cognitive dysfunction than DTI based FT in these tracts. In tracts without “crossing fiber” regions, both methods should perform equally. To test this hypothesis we used a hybrid framework, in which CSD based FT is combined with conventional DTI metrics to assess white matter abnormalities in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This allowed us to examine the microstructural properties of specific white matter pathways in relation to memory performance, while overcoming the well-known limitations of DTI based FT in regions with “crossing fibers”. We evaluated this CSD-DTI framework for two white matter tracts: one specifically selected because it contains many regions of “crossing fibers”, i.e. the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and one with only one fiber orientation, i.e. the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum (CC). Diffusion measures in these tracts have been previously shown to be altered in patients with AD compared to controls using tract based analyses <xref rid="pone.0044074-Pievani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and to the AD-associated impairments in memory function <xref rid="pone.0044074-Kavcic1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we examined whether CSD based FT combined with DTI metrics can increase the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in tracts with complex white matter architecture compared to conventionally applied DTI based FT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.

Our results indicate that 1) CSD based FT in combination with DTI metrics significantly increased the sensitivity to detect a relation between white matter abnormalities and memory performance in a tract with “crossing fibers” (SLF); and 2) the relation between DTI metrics and memory was comparable between both FT methods in a tract without “crossing fibers” (midsagittal section of the CC).</p><p>In line with our expectations, fibers of the SLF were more likely to terminate in regions with “crossing fibers” with DTI-based FT. By contrast, with CSD based FT the SLF continued beyond these crossings to more temporal and dorsal frontal regions, which is in line with descriptions from autopsy studies <xref rid="pone.0044074-Makris1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Burgel1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and with previous papers using spherical deconvolution based FT <xref rid="pone.0044074-ThiebautdeSchotten1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our results extend these findings by showing that improvement of fiber tract segmentation increases the sensitivity to white matter abnormalities within the tract.</p><p>The adverse effects of “crossing fibers” on the interpretation of diffusion measures such as MD and FA have been previously demonstrated (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0044074-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-WheelerKingshott1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Vos1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>), but their impact on the detection of white matter abnormalities is not known. A number of studies have found contra-intuitive results in regions with “crossing fibers”, such as the centrum semiovale, demonstrating increased FA values in patients compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0044074-Douaud1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Pierpaoli1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and a negative correlation between FA and cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0044074-Serra1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Tuch3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These unexpected findings may result from degeneration of one pathway, with relatively sparing of the crossing pathway. For example in AD, late-myelinating white matter tracts such as the SLF have been shown to degenerate at an earlier stage than tracts that myelinate early in life <xref rid="pone.0044074-Reisberg1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Stricker1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This is supported by results from a recent study showing an <italic toggle="yes">increased</italic> mode of anisotropy in patients with MCI compared to controls only in areas where the SLF intersects the projection pathways <xref rid="pone.0044074-Douaud1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Voxels with “crossing fibers” are more likely to be included with CSD based FT. We therefore used the planar diffusion coefficient as a covariate to overcome the confounding effects of these “crossing fibers” on the diffusion metrics in relation to cognition. If two fiber populations within a voxel “cross” or “kiss”, the shape of the diffusion tensor becomes more planar (disc-like). As a result, a voxel with intact crossing fibers can have a similar FA value compared to a voxel with a degenerating non-crossing fiber population. However, the planar diffusion coefficient between these voxels will be different <xref rid="pone.0044074-Leemans2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Our results showed that co-varying for the planar diffusion coefficient effectively increased the strength of the relation between DTI metrics in the SLF and memory performance. As expected, this modulation was most pronounced in combination with CSD based FT. Adjusting for the planar diffusion coefficient also increased the association between DTI metrics and memory in the CC, despite the lack of any interdigitating fiber pathways. Possibly, this finding can be explained by the presence of residual partial volume effects between the dorsal part of the CC and the adjacent cingulum bundles. Partial volume effects also affect the tensor estimation and the measures derived from it <xref rid="pone.0044074-Ennis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and may therefore confound the relation between DTI metrics and cognition in the same way.</p><p>The effects of DTI metrics on cognitive performance were more prominent for DR than for DA, suggesting that the observed association is more likely driven by myelodegeneration than by a loss of axonal integrity <xref rid="pone.0044074-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, it should be noted that many more cellular characteristics, such as hydration, cell packing density and fiber diameter could cause the observed changes in diffusion measures <xref rid="pone.0044074-Barkovich1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0044074-Virta1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and that the interpretation of these diffusivity measures can be far from trivial <xref rid="pone.0044074-WheelerKingshott1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. One is the modest sample size, which may have decreased our sensitivity to detect a relation between structure and function. Still, we were able to replicate previously observed associations between diffusion measures and AD severity <xref rid="pone.0044074-Bosch1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044074-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Second, FT based segmentation is laborious and time consuming. However, the advantage over automated voxel based or atlas based analyses is that it is less sensitive to individual anatomical differences, imperfect registration, and smoothing errors <xref rid="pone.0044074-VanHecke1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0044074-VanHecke3" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Moreover, averaging of the diffusion metrics along a fiber bundle reduces the variance in diffusion measures and thereby increases the power to detect more subtle WM changes. On the other hand, very localized changes along a fiber bundle, for instance, only in the structure’s anterior part, may not be picked up when the anterior and posterior parts are combined. To limit the number of comparisons we focused in the present study on two major tracts, but future studies should demonstrate whether these findings extend to other fiber pathways containing complex and simple white matter architecture known to be affected in AD <xref rid="pone.0044074-Mielke1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> or other neurological diseases.</p><p>Finally, the use of the planar diffusion coefficient as a quantitative measure to characterize “crossing fibers” may be valid in cases were two fiber bundles intersect or overlap, but may not be directly applicable in regions where three or more fiber bundles intersect. Although previous work reported that no more than two fiber populations could be observed in the SLF <xref rid="pone.0044074-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, there is still no consensus on the prevalence of multiple fiber populations <xref rid="pone.0044074-Jeurissen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this context, future studies are needed to investigate this issue in detail and more specific measures for “crossing fibers” need to be developed to improve the sensitivity for detecting white matter abnormalities in clinical populations and to make the interpretation of structure-function relationships less ambiguous.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since DTI based FT fails in regions with “crossing fibers”, more accurate methods to characterize the microstructural properties of fiber pathways are in need. Here we showed that CSD based FT combined with standard DTI metrics increases the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in a tract with “crossing fibers” in patients with early AD compared to DTI based FT. The use of a hybrid CSD-DTI framework is therefore a promising tool to detect functionally significant white matter changes in regions with complex white matter architecture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0044074.s001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>

Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common nonmotor symptoms of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD with dementia (PDD). PD-MCI is an intermediate state between PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PDD, with a prevalence of approximately 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], that can progress over time to either PD-NC or PDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, cognitive decline tends to be slow and insidious, and PD-MCI is often overlooked by patients and clinicians. Once the disease progresses to PDD, it seriously affects the quality of life of the patient. Accurate diagnosis of PD-MCI is essential for effective intervention and prevention of PDD.</p><p id="Par22">The current diagnosis of PD-MCI mainly depends on clinical symptoms and neuropsychological tests, but some challenges remain in terms of the homogeneity of the neuropsychological test results, and the testing process is time consuming and labour intensive. Therefore, there is a need for an easier and more accurate method to establish the diagnosis of PD-MCI.</p><p id="Par23">The classical mechanism underlying PD-MCI is the abnormal accumulation of Lewy bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and β-amyloid (Aβ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in neuronal cell bodies and axons accompanied by damage to glial cells, demyelination of axons, and increased microglial concentrations in the extracellular space. Structural MR studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have confirmed that the progression of cognitive impairment in PD is closely related to white matter (WM) damage and that the range of WM hyperintensity is a moderate risk factor for cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, WM microstructural changes occur prior to grey matter volume atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques are currently recognized as the most reliable noninvasive methods for quantifying WM fibre integrity, demonstrating greater sensitivity than conventional MRI in revealing WM microstructural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous DTI studies calculated a series of intravoxel DTI indices, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), based on a diffusion tensor model and confirmed that the WM microstructure deteriorates across stages of cognitive decline in PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Specifically, decreased FA and increased MD, mainly in the bilateral frontal white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], corpus callosum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and temporal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], are related to cognitive dysfunction. Recently, Gong et al. proposed a novel intervoxel metric named local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. LDH is independent of the diffusion model and can reveal intervoxel diffusion properties by capturing the overall coherence of water molecule diffusion within a neighbourhood; it reflects the microstructural coherence of the underlying WM fibres and provides additional insights beyond traditional intravoxel metrics. Some recent studies have applied LDH parameters to the detection of WM microstructure abnormalities in vascular cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and blepharospasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], demonstrating regions of variation that differed from those of intravoxel diffusion metrics. Moreover, LDH can help predict the prognosis of stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, LDH alterations in PD or PD-MCI patients have not been fully explored.</p><p id="Par25">In summary, traditional statistical methods for comparing groups have demonstrated significant differences in WM microstructure between PD-MCI patients and PD-NC patients, providing new evidence for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD. However, these studies have not been translated into suitable biomarkers for identifying PD-MCI at the individual level. Additionally, it is unknown which metric is the most accurate and useful for predicting PD-MCI. In particular, the role of LDH is unclear. Machine learning classification provides a powerful method for predicting an individual’s disease status based on MRI data and has been applied to generate imaging biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Tree model algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are relatively basic and widely used classes of models in machine learning. These tree models are built with a small amount of data, have a moderately complex algorithm time, and are more interpretable than neural network algorithms. Studies have confirmed the potential of tree model algorithms in studies on automatic PD identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">This study aimed to develop a machine learning model based on DTI data to automatically classify PD patients without dementia as PD-MCI and PD-NC, thus providing a more convenient method for the early clinical detection of MCI. We hypothesized that tree models employing the means of DTI indices extracted from atlas-based WM segmentation as input features would be helpful for PD-MCI diagnosis, and combining intra- and intervoxel DTI metrics could improve prediction precision. Finally, we assessed the correlations between the regional DTI parameter values of selected features and neuropsychological scores and calculated the importance of the features of the best model using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to validate and explain the model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and ethics</title><p id="Par27">A total of 133 PD patients were recruited from the Department of Neurology of the First Hospital of China Medical University from June 2013 to June 2019.

In addition, we calculated an intervoxel diffusivity metric called local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (LDH) and Kendall’s coefficient concordance (LDHk); the specific calculations were performed according to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The training dataset was used for feature selection and model construction, and the test dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the model. A feature selection procedure was performed to remove redundant features to prevent model overfitting. First, all features were normalized by L2 normalization. Next, the random forest (RF) feature selection algorithm was applied to rank the importance of each feature, 10-fold cross-validation was performed, and the top 3% most important features were retained. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlations among the remaining connectome features. When the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.7 and the p value was &lt; 0.05, the feature with the lower importance was excluded.

For the combined metrics model, the RF feature selection retained the top 12 features in terms of feature importance. After Spearman’s rank correlation analysis, 5 features were excluded. Finally, the 7 most discriminative DTI features were retained (including three LDHs, two LDHk and two MD values). The WM structural connectivity areas with classification significance were mainly located in the brainstem—pontine crossing tract (PCT), medial lemniscus (ML), right cingulum (hippocampus) and left fornix (cres)/stria terminalis.

The main contributions were as follows: First, to our knowledge, this was the first time that LDHs and LDHk (novel intervoxel DTI indices) were used as classification metrics. We confirmed that these metrics can be used as a complement to intravoxel metrics to improve the classification accuracy for PD-NC and PD-MCI patients. Second, the XGBoost model based on the combined intra- and intervoxel metrics achieved a classification accuracy of 91.67% and an AUC of 0.94 in the test dataset and was the best performing model. Finally, by applying the SHAP method to interpret the best model, the LDHk values of the pontine crossing tract (PCT) were found to be important features, as were the MD values of the right cingulum (hippocampus).</p><p id="Par50">Although neuropsychological testing remains the primary method for assessing the presence or absence of cognitive decline in PD patients, neuroimaging studies have observed brain structural and functional changes in patients with PD-MCI by measuring grey matter volume, white matter damage, and resting-state functional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For years, machine learning studies used neuroimaging or electrophysiology data to build classifiers for PD-MCI. One study found that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals achieved 84% classification accuracy in identifying PD-MCI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Zhang et al.‘s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] combined EEG and grey matter structural MRI as input features to identify patients with PD-MCI, achieving the highest accuracy of 77%. Moreover, Lenfeldt et al. found that white matter DTI values are more sensitive neuroimaging indicators than grey matter atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, previous DTI studies have mainly focused on the differences in intravoxel diffusion parameters, finding that cognitive impairment is associated with decreased FA and increased MD, AD, and RD values in multiple WM regions, particularly in the predominantly anterior WM tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Haller et al. attempted to use machine learning algorithms based on intravoxel DTI indicators to diagnose Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with accuracies of up to 97%. However, we have not found any research utilizing machine learning models with DTI features to automatically identify PD-MCI patients. Our study confirms that intervoxel metrics that reflect the microstructural consistency of white matter fibre tracts can complement traditional intravoxel metrics to reveal a comprehensive picture of WM alterations. The reason this phenomenon has not been described appears to be that previous works did not consider intervoxel DTI metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to automatically identify PD-MCI using machine learning methods based on both intra- and intervoxel DTI features. Regarding the machine learning-based algorithms, we found that XGBoost-based algorithms achieved better performance, which is consistent with previous research. Lee et al. confirmed that an XGBoost model based on electroencephalography signals had a good effect in the diagnosis of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with the highest accuracy rate of 71.4%. Shibata et al. applied the XGBoost model based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (a type of MR method reflecting iron deposition) features to classify PD-MCI and PD-NC patients, achieving an accuracy of 79.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">This study used SHAP analysis to interpret the best model, which revealed that the MD values of the right cingulum and the LDHk values of the PCT were the most important features, as well as the LDH values of the ML, another region of the brainstem. Statistical analysis revealed that the LDHk value of the PCT in the PD-MCI group was lower than that in the PD-NC group and that in general, the LDHk value of the PCT was positively correlated with the MoCA score. One of the pathological hallmarks of PD is dopaminergic neuron loss, and postmortem studies have confirmed that human brainstem regions, such as the substantia nigra, red nucleus, medial lemniscus, and pontine nucleus, highly express D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the PCT and ML are the main structural connections of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits. Various lines of evidence suggest that the CTC circuits play a critical role in the cognitive symptoms of PD. Pathological studies have confirmed the presence of landmark Lewy body pathology aggregates in the cerebellar nuclei and adjacent white matter displayed in PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that the CTC loop mediates the involvement of the cerebellum in higher-order cognitive processes, such as planning, verbal fluency, mental flexibility, abstract reasoning, and working memory; its dysfunction contributes to cognitive dysfunction in PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, our results further support the notion that the CTC circuitry is affected by disease-specific impairments in PD and contributes to cognitive dysfunction in PD. Moreover, the PCT and ML contain topologically arranged projection fibres, and adjacent voxels may project to very different neocortices. Thus, it is possible that when one of the voxels suggests damage, its neighbours remain normal. LDH estimates the overall consistency of diffusion of water molecules between a voxel and its neighbours, and so abnormalities in the PCT and ML may be more sensitive to LDH.</p><p id="Par52">In addition, the MD value of the right cingulum (hippocampus) was the second most important feature and was significantly negatively correlated with MoCA scores. Several studies have shown susceptibility alterations in the hippocampus in patients with PD-MCI. The hippocampus plays an important role in the interaction between dopamine transmission and hippocampal synaptic remodelling, and an imbalance in this interaction leads to dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Neuropathological studies have observed Lewy body pathology (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in the hippocampus of PD patients, and the degree of cognitive impairment is correlated with the degree of Lewy body deposition in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Increased MD indicates extensive cellular damage, including oedema and necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Multimodal MRI studies have confirmed that injury to the structural integrity and connectivity of the fornix-hippocampal projections is associated with decreased memory test scores in PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. DTI studies have confirmed that PD-NC patients showed increased fornix MD values compared with those of HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and PDD patients showed lower hippocampal FA values than PD patients without dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, the LDHk value of the left fornix (cres)/stria terminalis was also decreased in the PD-MCI group. This finding indicates that microstructural damage to the fornix-hippocampal projection plays an important role in the cognitive impairment in PD. The pathological changes in the hippocampus may be relatively dispersed, and the transition from the normal area to the abnormal area is not as sudden as that in the PCT and ML. Therefore, the MD index of the hippocampus has classification importance.</p><p id="Par53">Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, this work is a retrospective study, and prospective studies are needed in the future to validate whether the proposed method can predict the conversion of PD-NC to PD-MCI. Additionally, although this study adopted the simpler level I diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI, one study confirmed that level II criteria did not add value to the level I criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Second, this study did not further subdivide patients according to cognitive impairment, specifically including (1) frontal-dominant impairment and (2) posterior-cortical-dominant impairment, which is a future research direction we plan to pursue. Finally, the present study only explored the predictive ability of DTI parameters in white matter brain regions for PD-MCI patients, which may be a rather one-sided analysis, and multimodal data (including spatial and temporal features) are needed in the future to fully explore the mechanisms of PD-MCI and increase accuracy of machine learning models, as studied by Bianchetti et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par54">In conclusion, a machine learning model trained with DTI metrics extracted from atlas-based WM segmentation shows potential in differentiating individuals with PD-MCI from PD patients without dementia. Specifically, the combined application of intra- and intervoxel diffusion measures can provide more comprehensive information about white matter alterations and improve classification accuracy. XGBoost models based on combined DTI indices are particularly promising classifiers with high classification accuracy. After further validation, the model may become a valuable tool in supporting PD-MCI clinical diagnostic systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>

DTI has been widely applied in studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to obtain new insights into the tissue structure of brain white matter, including quantitative measurements of tissue properties such as diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion tensor <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mielke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Head1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A number of studies have reported reduced FA and increased diffusivity in patients with AD in the fornix <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mielke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and the cingulum bundle <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Fellgiebel3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mielke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Head1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Most of these studies have been limited to measurements of contrasts such as diffusivity and FA using manual region-of-interest (ROI) or voxel-based analysis. Evidence that shape analysis on gray matter structures (e.g. the hippocampus) distinguished patients with AD from healthy control subjects <xref rid="pone.0009811-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Apostolova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Csernansky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> suggests that geometric shapes of the white matter tracts may also give insights of the disease. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to study the geometry (such as shape) of the white matter tracts revealed by DTI and its relationship with AD because of difficulties in quantifying specific white matter structures visualized by the DTI acquisition. Therefore, this paper focused on surface models of shapes and FA of deep white matter tracts and identified their relationship with AD.</p><p>Adapting voxel-based morphometry used in structural MRI <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the voxel-based analysis of DTI serves as an exploratory analysis to make statistical inferences about differences in diffusion properties of brain tissues in an atlas coordinate system. It first spatially normalizes the images of individual subjects (such as FA, T<sub>1</sub> or T<sub>2</sub>) to an atlas' whole brain space where spatial smoothing and voxel-by-voxel statistical testing are then performed. Recent registration algorithms specialized for DTI have been developed and have shown to improve structural alignment when considering the tensor structure of DTI <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Irfanoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Voxel-based analysis in DTI has been widely used to identify FA and diffusivity abnormalities in a variety of clinical studies. Nevertheless, there is the need for spatial smoothing which makes localization of abnormalities challenging to interpret in terms of the white matter tracts. To address this issue, researchers <xref rid="pone.0009811-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Yushkevich1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Maddah1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> characterized FA or diffusivity as functions indexed over manifolds such as curves, medial surfaces representative of the overall geometry of a white matter tract, and skeleton of the white matter. These demonstrated the potential for increased sensitivity in statistical analysis using geometrical models of the white matter tracts and tract-based analysis.</p><p>In this study, we followed the idea of the tract-based analysis and introduced the surface representation of twenty three deep white matter tracts that were defined based on Mori's white matter atlas <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We chose these deep white matter structures because they are reliably delineated from DTI and some of them are adjacent to gray matter structures (e.g., hippocampus) with anatomical abnormalities in AD. Perhaps, gray matter abnormalities could influence adjacent white matter structures during AD process. Using advanced brain mapping techniques, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ceritoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Vaillant1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the surface model of the white matter tracts was automatically constructed by transforming the shape of the atlas white matter tracts to individual subjects through a flow of diffeomorphisms. This surface model facilitated the study on local shape and FA variations of the white matter tracts. Given the important role of the hippocampal shape in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy control subjects, we expect that the white matter tracts connecting the hippocampus to the rest of the brain, such as the cingulum tract, would show regionally-specific shape abnormalities in AD. Additionally, we also expect regionally-specific pattern of FA reduction in AD as measurement of white matter tissue disruption. Compared with traditional ROI-based volumetric and mean FA analysis on the white matter tracts, the regionally-specific pattern of FA reduction and shape abnormalities would potentially increase statistical power for differentiating AD from healthy aging, which would be beneficial to clinical diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We applied the surface-based analysis for assessing shape abnormalities of the deep white matter tracts in 19 normal comparison subjects and in 13 subjects with AD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009811-t001">Table 1</xref>). Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009811-g001">Figure 1</xref> are examples of the white matter tracts extracted from the DT images of a healthy elderly (top row) and a patient with AD (bottom row) according to anatomical definitions given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009811-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Volume and surface representations are respectively shown in the left and right columns. Visually, the extracted deep white matter tracts clearly include the region with high FA. The enlarged lateral ventricles in the patient with AD did not influence the extraction accuracy of the commissural tract and other surrounding white matter tracts. The accuracy of this atlas-based diffeomorphic segmentation for extracting the white matter tracts has been validated using 237 manually labeled landmarks in the DT images of 13 AD patients and 18 healthy elderly subjects <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ceritoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These DT images were a subset of the images used in this study. The landmarks were placed at the boundary of the white matter tracts <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the healthy control subjects, 80% of deformed landmarks had distance to the manually labeled landmarks less than 2.2 mm (DTI resolution), while in the AD patients, 70% of deformed landmarks had distance to the manually labeled landmarks less than 2.2 mm (Figure 7 in <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ceritoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). The test-retest reliability of the landmark placement was 1.58±0.60mm, suggesting that the segmentation quality approached the accuracy of this measurement.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0009811-t001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009811.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Demographic and clinical information.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone-0009811-t001-1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0009811.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CON</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.5 (5.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.5 (6.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CDR-SB (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.77 (2.19)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>Key: SD — standard deviation; CON — healthy controls; AD — Alzheimer's disease; MMSE — mini-mental state examination; CDR-SB — Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="pone-0009811-g001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009811.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Examples of the white matter tract segmentation.</title><p>Rows respectively illustrate the white matter tracts of a healthy elderly subject and a patient with AD.

Using DTI, our study further confirmed the local volume loss and FA reduction of the cingulum tract in AD. Based on the white matter atlas, this cingulum tract contains fibers connecting the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus proper to the posterior cingulate cortex <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, cortico-thalamic fibers, as well as cortico-cerebellar fibers <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This is in agreement with the finding that the hypometabolism in the limbic circuit results from the hippocampal formation atrophy via the cingulum tract disruption, which was suggested in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0009811-Villain1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It also interprets the striking discrepancy between the hypometabolic profile and the well described brain atrophy pattern in AD. Brain atrophy is characterized by the early involvement of the medial temporal lobe, subsequently spreading to the lateral temporal areas before extending to the cingulate and temporoparietal, frontal and occipital regions <xref rid="pone.0009811-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, consistent with the course of neurofibrillary degenerations <xref rid="pone.0009811-Braak1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Nevertheless, brain glucose metabolism alterations are characterized by the early involvement of the posterior cingulate cortex, subsequently spreading to the neighboring precuneus and temporoparietal regions <xref rid="pone.0009811-Chetelat1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mevel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Seeley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Using DTI, our study for the first time reported the shape abnormality and FA reduction in the sagittal stratum tract that contains the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus <xref rid="pone.0009811-Mangin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the posterior thalamic radiation. DTI tractography showed that the ILF directly connects occipital branches related to areas V2 and V4 and anterior temporal branches related to the lateral temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala <xref rid="pone.0009811-Catani1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The patient described by Ross <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> with a lesion apparently restricted to the ILF was unable to learn novel, non-verbalizable visual stimuli, despite the fact that visual information was able to reach the medial temporal lobe through other indirect pathways. One function of the direct pathway between the occipital and temporal lobes through the ILF is perhaps to prime medical temporal structures to facilitate the consolidation of visual memories. It therefore suggests that cognition impairment in visuospatial memory in AD could be due to disruption in the ILF. In addition to the ILF, the IFO, posterior thalamic radiation, EC, and SLF contain connections among the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes, and the cerebellum. Regional shape compression and FA reduction in these tracts may indicate the loss of neuronal axons or loss of connection with the cortex, suggesting a disruption in direct or indirect connectivity of the temporal lobe with the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes as well as the cerebellum. As AD progresses, the propagation of the gray matter atrophy in AD from the temporal lobe to the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes as well as the cerebellum may therefore be due to connectivity disruption in these tract regions.</p><p>Our findings support that AD is thought to reflect disrupted cortical connectivity. Integration of these shape abnormalities with white matter tissue properties (e.g. FA) provides new insights of abnormalities in white matter structures in AD. An open question is how these white matter changes in terms of geometry and tissue properties predict the disease when compared with the gray matter atrophy, cortical metabolism and functional connectivity, as well as underlying neuropathology that have been identified as image markers of AD <xref rid="pone.0009811-Buckner1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Buckner2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. One possibility is that disruption in the white matter tracts near the temporal lobe represents the secondary consequence of the medial temporal lobe pathology. Subsequently, metabolic effects and brain atrophy represent the consequence of regionally-specific white matter tract disruption. Future research will be required to determine the relationship of white matter disruption with gray matter atrophy and cortical hypometabolism in AD, which may explain why certain regions of the brain show preferential vulnerability to AD as the disease progresses.</p><p>The data analysis in this study offers several strengths. The main contribution of this work is its construction of the surface representation of deep white matter tracts. The surface model is a natural representation for white matter tracts because the surface effectively summarizes the overall shape of the white matter tract whose variations relative to the atlas can be characterized as a scalar field of the surface through the surface diffeomorphic metric mapping <xref rid="pone.0009811-Vaillant1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Vaillant2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This provides a natural way for reducing the dimensionality of the shape deformation and offers an alternative to smoothing and performing statistical analysis based on geometric models of white matter tracts (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0009811-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Qiu2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>). Furthermore, our surface-based analysis also offers a natural representation of diffusion properties as a function indexed over the surface manifold by projecting the diffusion measures (e.g. FA, diffusivity) onto it. Our clinical study with a small sample size demonstrates the feasibility and sensitivity of using the surface-based analysis to identify the regionally-specific shape and FA abnormalities in AD.</p><p>There are, however, several limitations to the proposed analysis framework. First, our atlas-based segmentation uses multiple image contrasts to drive the spatial normalization. It is possible to use the tensor information instead. Several methods have been postulated to use the full tensor for the spatial normalization of DTI <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Zhang4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. They may provide additional benefits to further improve mapping accuracy. Second, the shape analysis introduced in this paper considers individual white matter tracts as whole, which cannot provide shape information (e.g. twist, split, interrupt) of individual white matter fibers. As the validity and reliability of the white matter fiber extraction is proven increasingly, we will accordingly be able to adapt our current analysis to investigating individual white matter fiber shape using the LDDMM curve mapping <xref rid="pone.0009811-Qiu3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Glauns1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, the white matter bundles near the cortex are not included in this study. Our analysis framework could be applied to them when the atlas of these bundles is defined such as one introduced in <xref rid="pone.0009811-Oishi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, the white matter atlas was built on a single-subject's DTI image. There is a reason for choosing this single-subject atlas rather than a population-averaged atlas. High-dimensional non-linear registration methods may not work properly with the population-averaged atlas in which the anatomical structures are blurred due to averaging. This is not a substantial issue for linear normalization, which is mostly driven by a large contrast change at the outside boundary of the brain, but the blurred internal structures could easily confuse high-dimensional non-linear registration <xref rid="pone.0009811-Ceritoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Ideally, if the spatial normalization algorithm is perfect, the single-subject atlas simply serves as the origin of coordinates to measure anatomical variability and the location of the origin may not be important as long as we are interested in differences among groups. However, in reality, our atlas-based diffeomorphic segmentation assumes that the overall appearance of subjects' DTI images is sufficiently similar to that of this atlas so that the diffeomorphic mapping is feasible to deform the atlas to subjects. In studies where subjects with large tumor, or brain lesions are present, this atlas-based segmentation is likely not feasible. Recent advantages in DTI segmentation and higher resolution imaging may indeed make it possible to consistently label the tracts in individual subject images <xref rid="pone.0009811-Lenglet1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-ODonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-ODonnell2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>4.1 Subjects</title><p>Two groups of subjects were included in the present study: (1) Healthy Controls (CON) (n = 19): subjects who were cognitively normal and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 <xref rid="pone.0009811-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009811-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>; (2) Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 13): subjects who had mild AD, had a CDR = 1, and met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for AD <xref rid="pone.0009811-McKhann1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

We considered two steps that contribute to the mapping of a voxel in the volume of the white matter tract to a vertex on its corresponding surface. The first step was to find the proper association between the voxels in the white matter tract volume and its surface based on their Euclidean distance. Each vertex on the surface was thus associated with a set containing the voxels that have the shortest distance to this vertex. In the second step, FA value at this vertex was computed as averaged FA value over the set of its associated voxels.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>4.6 Statistical Analysis</title><p>At each point on the tract atlas surface, the surface deformation map was modeled using linear regression with diagnosis as the main factor and the total intracranial volume as a covariate. The surface-based FA map was also modeled using linear regression with diagnosis as the main factor. The statistical results were corrected for multiple comparisons using permutation tests to determine the overall significance of the statistical maps. In each permutation trial, diagnostic labeling was randomly assigned to each subject and the number of points with significant main effects (p&lt;0.05) was recorded. After 10,000 permutation trials, the overall significance was computed as the fraction of the time the suprathreshold area was greater in the randomized maps than the real effect <xref rid="pone.0009811-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) <xref rid="pone.0009811-Jolliffe1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) <xref rid="pone.0009811-Duda1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> were applied for examining how well the FA maps and the deformation maps can distinguish the patients with AD from the healthy control subjects. PCA was first employed to reduce the dimensionality of the FA maps or the deformation maps. To identify the principal components (PCs) that significantly contributed to group differences, we first examined the two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test on each PC. A set containing PCs with corresponding p-value less than 0.05 was then chosen as feature space in LDA. Leave-one-out cross validation was used to examine the LDA performance. Classification accuracy rate, sensitivity, specificity, as well F-score were computed as quantitative evaluation of the LDA classification.</p><p>To examine the correlation of the FA map with the clinical measure of MMSE, PCs selected from the classification using the FA map were used to generate canonical scores. The canonical analysis was designed to score the control and AD subjects along the dimension that showed the difference between these two groups. More specifically, using a general linear model with the PC scores as dependent variables, and group as predictor variable, the canonical analysis computed the first eigenvector of matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="image" xlink:href="pone.0009811.e082.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="image" xlink:href="pone.0009811.e083.jpg"/></inline-formula> was the sum of squares and cross-products (SSCP) matrix associated with the contrast between the control and AD subjects, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="image" xlink:href="pone.0009811.e084.jpg"/></inline-formula> was the SSCP matrix of the model residuals (derived from the full model using all subjects). A canonical score was obtained for each subject by applying the weighting coefficients in the eigenvector to the original dependent variables (i.e., the PC scores). Pearson's correlation analysis was performed on the canonical scores with MMSE scores. We repeated this analysis for investigating the correlation of the deformation map with MMSE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009811.s001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Anatomical definition of white matter tracts.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0009811.s001.doc" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This research was supported by grants from the National University of Singapore: start-up grant R-397-000-058-133 (AQ); the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*STAR) Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) 082-101-0025 (AQ); A*STAR's Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) SICS-09/1/1/001 (AQ); the National Institute on Aging (P50-AG005146 and P50-AG 021334); and the National Institute of Research Resources (NCRR, P41-RR15241).

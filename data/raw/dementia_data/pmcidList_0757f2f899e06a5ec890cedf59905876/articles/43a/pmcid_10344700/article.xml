VCI is associated with modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that VCI could be preventable <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Hence it is important to assess vascular imaging measures and their potential role as biomarkers.</p><p id="para0012">It is difficult to directly assess brain vascular pathology, particularly small vessel disease (SVD), in vivo <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, surrogate measures such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been utilised. DTI reveals disruption within brain networks by quantifying subtle changes in white matter (WM) microstructure <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and is particularly sensitive to WM damage in small vessel disease <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Normal appearing white matter (NAWM) microstructure could be investigated using DTI, with WMH displaying reduced NAWM integrity, depending on the proximity to WM lesions [<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There are several quantitative DTI markers. Median and peak height of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are DTI markers derived from histogram analysis of the NAWM, with FA and MD measuring the directionality and magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in tissue respectively <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) are also DTI markers correlated with axonal and myelin damage <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. MD and FA were found to be correlated to age-related cognitive decline, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and are more sensitive to WM damage than WMH lesions load <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A greater understanding regarding the association between NAWM and cognitive decline is required.</p><p id="para0013">Previous single and multi-center cross-sectional studies have reported associations between DTI measures and impaired cognitive function, not only in regions of WM abnormalities but also in NAWM regions, in populations such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and community-based cohorts <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. DTI measures have also shown to be strongly associated with vascular-related cognitive deficits such as executive function and processing speed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> supporting their use as pre-clinical markers in SVD. Additionally, even in shorter periods of 1–3 years, changes in DTI have been detected in SVD patients, [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] further reinforcing the potential utility of DTI measures even in smaller sample sizes as previously shown in the OPtimising mulTImodal MRI markers for use as surrogate markers in trials of Vascular Cognitive Impairment due to cerebrAl small vesseL disease (OPTIMAL) study <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref></p><p id="para0014">Despite these findings, there is limited longitudinal data analyzing the association of DTI measures in NAWM with individual cognitive trajectories <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The study aims to fill this gap by examining the association between baseline DTI measures assessing NAWM tissue integrity and cognition in memory clinic patients consisting of normal cognition and cognitive impairment in longitudinal analysis. The focus on longitudinal analysis over a two-year follow-up period distinguishes this study from previous research. We hypothesize that baseline DTI measures predicts for cognitive decline, over two years of follow-up in a memory clinic cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Study setting and sample</title><p id="para0015">This study involved patients from a memory clinic study conducted at the National University Hospital, Singapore.

MD and FA maps were created with ‘DTIFIT’. FLAIR to T1-weighted and T1-weighted to b0 registrations were performed and the affine transformation matrices were concatenated to produce a FLAIR-to-DTI transformation. Tissue Probability Maps were registered into DTI space using these transformations. Hard segmentations were applied to generate maps of tissue classes, achieved by voxel-wise comparison of the gray matter, WM and cerebrospinal fluid Tissue Probability Maps, with each voxel being assigned to the highest probability tissue class. To identify NAWM, T1-weighed structural images and T2-weighed FLAIR images were registered to the b0 image using 12 parameter affine registration with a normalised mutual information cost function. These transformations were applied to WMH lesion masks. NAWM in DTI was classified as non-lesion voxels where the probability of WM was greater than gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Histogram analysis was conducted on the MD and FA maps in NAWM regions.

Using Model III, cognitive trajectories over time were presented visually by plotting the estimated marginal means of the cognition score at baseline, year 1 and year 2 with the baseline DTI measure specified at ±1 SD and at the mean.</p><p id="para0030">To calculate the ratio of the absolute mean difference in the cognitive z-scores between Year 2 and Year 0 of baseline DTI measures with significant time interaction, delta method was used. The ratios and their corresponding 95% CIs were reported. Similarly, ratios with P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p id="para0031">All statistical analyses were performed using STATA (Stata Version17, StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec0011"><label>3.1</label><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p id="para0032">The baseline characteristics of the 252 patients analyzed is presented in <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref>.

In our study, NAWM microstructure was similarly associated with cognitive deficit in executive function and visuospatial function while cognitive deficit in memory was associated to a lesser extent (only MD measures). This suggests that DTI measures might be a sensitive marker for vascular damage, with ischemic changes causing NAWM tract abnormalities including increased diffusivity magnitude and possible loss of myelin. Network disruption in NAWM could be driven by ischemic processes in multiple cognitive domains prior to the development of visible vascular lesions. Even though there were a greater proportion of NCI and CIND than VCIND in our study population, similar associations of DTI with executive function and visuospatial function were also found in those with SVD in other studies [<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, similar domains are also affected by WM atrophy, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> which were not adjusted for in our current study.</p><p id="para0048">The underlying pathology of DTI measures is not fully understood, but pathology studies have supported MD and FA measures as well as AD and RD to reflect breakdown in WM microstructure <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The discrepancy in the associations between both measures (MD and FA) with memory and visuomotor speed found in our study suggests that the pathophysiology measured by MD and FA could be different, with similar findings in other studies as well <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Our finding on memory lends strength to the smaller studies which found only MD to be primarily related to memory [<xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. One study on interstitial cerebral edema had proposed that MD measures, which reflect diffuse changes, could be reversible after treatment, while FA measures were considered irreversible <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. More research is needed on understanding the pathophysiology of MD measures, as it could reveal important targets that could potentially be reversible. Overall, our data suggests utility of DTI histogram-derived measures as a pre-clinical marker to predict the worsening of cognition, where ischemic changes is likely responsible for NAWM damage in MCI.</p><p id="para0049">Our study has several strengths. Firstly, longitudinal analyses allowed us to associate cognitive scores over time with baseline measurement of NAWM microstructure suggesting changes in NAWM potentially contributes to the worsening of cognition. Secondly, the use of a locally validated neuropsychological test battery provided comprehensive information in multiple cognitive domains. Thirdly, as DTI measures are statistically calculated from diffusion MRI images, its non-invasive and automated nature are major advantages of this technique. DTI histogram-derived measures have shown to be reproducible, with low variability on repeated imaging <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Whole brain histogram analysis also lends strength in quantifying total disease burden. Lastly, the use of GEE in our analysis to account for repeated measurements of cognition scores, as well as adjustment for various confounders including demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease.</p><p id="para0050">A main limitation of histogram analysis is the loss of topographic information. Regional information can be recovered if the histogram calculation is led by segmentation using anatomic landmarks <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In regards to methodological limitations, the findings of this study are restricted to elderly individuals with (V)CIND or NCI in memory clinic settings and may not be generalizable to older people in the general population. Though our study population consisted of individuals with cerebrovascular disease, we were unable to perform analysis separately for small and large vessel disease. This would be of interest for future studies to further delineate the effects of DTI on cognitive decline. There may have been selection bias introduced, whereby there might have been an underestimation of effects on cognition due to restricting analysis to NCI and CIND and excluding those with dementia. DTI measures should be interpreted as an indirect approximation to WM microstructural status <xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Markers should not be used independently, where more than one modality might improve prediction of future dementia. Future studies should include the analysis of other DTI measures and tract specific analysis to further determine their relationship with cognitive decline.</p><p id="para0051">For potential clinical applications, individuals with cerebral SVD would benefit greatly from the information on DTI measures, to predict severe sporadic SVD progression, which would likely lead to an eventual conversion to dementia <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the potential utility of summary statistics from DTI histogram analysis to detect subtle ischemic changes of NAWM. Our findings provide evidence that baseline DTI measures are associated with cognitive decline, suggesting the potential use of DTI as a pre-clinical marker in predicting the worsening of cognition in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec0019"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="para0052">Data can be obtained upon request.

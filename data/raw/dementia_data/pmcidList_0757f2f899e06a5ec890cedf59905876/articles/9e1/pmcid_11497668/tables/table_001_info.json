Models are adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, current smoking, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and time interval between blood draw and neuropsychological assessment. Values represent beta coefficients (\u03b2), and their corresponding standard errors (SE) and raw p\u2010values (p). Statistically significant findings after false discovery rate control at 5% using the Benjamini\u2010Hochberg procedure are indicated in bold.Abbreviations: FLI, free leptin index; HVOT, Hooper Visual Organization Test.;sOB\u2010R, soluble leptin receptor; TMT, Trail Making Test.aThese variables have been natural log\u2010transformed to normalize their distributions.bScores were multiplied by \u22121 so that higher scores reflect better cognitive performance.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_001.csv"}

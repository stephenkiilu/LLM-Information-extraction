Values represent the p\u2010value of the respective product term (p for interaction). Only significant findings at p \u2264 0.1 are presented.bLinear regression models with the respective MRI measure or neuropsychological test score as the outcome and the respective leptin marker as the main predictor, conducted in different WHR subgroups.cModels are adjusted for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, current smoking, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and time interval between blood draw and MRI acquisition.dThese variables have been natural log\u2010transformed to normalize their distributions.eModels are further adjusted for total cranial volume.", "n_header_rows": 2, "table_data_file": "table_005.csv"}

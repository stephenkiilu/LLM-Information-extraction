(MD) have been proposed as clinical trial markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) due to their associations with outcomes such as cognition. However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n° lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized β =0.268), mental flexibility (β =0.306), verbal fluency (β =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (β =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>cerebral small vessel disease</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor imaging</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes a quarter of all ischaemic strokes, is the most common pathology underlying vascular cognitive impairment and dementia [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and contributes to the severity of Alzheimer’s disease [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SVD affects the small vessels of the brain and results in a number of characteristic radiological appearances best seen on MRI, including lacunar infarcts, T2-white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In terms of symptoms, cognitive impairment may be the most debilitating [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with SVD characteristically associated with early deficits in executive function and processing speed, while episodic memory is relatively spared [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Despite the public health importance of SVD, there are few specific treatments [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, evaluating treatments represent a major challenge due to the variable rate of cognitive decline, which can be slow in many patients, but occurs rapidly with progression to dementia in a subset. While cognitive testing plays a central role in identifying the presence of cognitive impairment, it has proved to be relatively insensitive to longitudinal change [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This has led to the suggestion that MRI might represent a useful surrogate marker to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in smaller number of patients prior to larger phase III trials [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to be particularly sensitive to white matter damage in SVD. Abnormalities have been shown not only within T2-WMH but also in apparently ‘normal appearing white matter’ [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and these changes correlate better with cognition than WMH lesion volume [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In single-centre studies, change in DTI could be detected in SVD patients over follow-up periods of 1–3 years [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This has led to the suggestion that DTI might provide a useful surrogate marker and power calculations for phase II trials based on the rate of DTI change seen in these papers, which show that its use may allow evaluation of therapeutic interventions with much smaller sample sizes than if cognitive function was used as an outcome measure [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, studies conducted to date have been single-centre [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most therapeutic trials are likely to be multicentre and involve acquisition of DTI across different sites. As image acquisition will be on different scanners, this may present challenges [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is important to assess whether DTI is feasible in a clinical trial setting, and whether similar associations between MRI parameters and clinical and cognitive variables can be detected in the multicentre setting. One way of assessing this is to determine whether the strength of association between DTI and cognition in multicentre studies is similar to that previously reported in single-centre studies.</p><p>To evaluate this, we determined the association between DTI parameters and cognition in the baseline data of a multicentre trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>PRESERVE study</title><p>The PRESERVE study (‘How intensively should we treat blood PRESsure in established cERebral small VEssel disease?’) is a multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing a strategy of intensive compared with standard treatment of blood pressure on cognitive function over a 2-year follow-up period.

This included for Processing speed the Digit Symbol Coding test (DSC) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and for executive functioning the Trail Making Test (TMT, [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) to measure mental flexibility and a phonemic verbal fluency task ("FAS") [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and a semantic verbal fluency task (animals) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to measure verbal generativity.Memory was measured using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT, [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Premorbid IQ was estimated using the restandardized National Adult Reading Test (NART-R, [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) and additional screening for cognitive impairment was conducted using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]).</p><p>In addition, following assessments of disability and quality of life (QoL) were performed; the stroke-specific QoL assessment (SSQoL) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the EuroQoL [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Performance across neuropsychological tests was made comparable by transforming raw scores into z-scores using the best available age-scaled normative data (DSC; [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], TMT; [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], letter fluency; [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], animal fluency; [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], RAVLT; [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]).

Within the six centres, eight 3-Tesla MR scanners were used (three Philips Achieva TX, one Philips Achieva, one Philips Ingenia, one Siemens Verio, one Siemens Prisma, one Siemens Magnetom Prisma fit). MRI acquisition included 3D T1-weighted (T1W), and DTI, T2*-weighted (T2*W) and Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) scans for each participant. A rigorous quality control was implemented to ensure sequence acquisition parameters were as standardized as possible. T1W scans were acquired at 1-mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic voxel resolution and TR and TE were optimized to ensure comparable T1 weighting and tissue contrast across sites. DTI scans (2-mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic voxel resolution) had similar TEs and long TRs to avoid T1 relaxation effects. In addition to the b =0 s mm<sup>−2</sup> acquisitions, all DTI acquisition included 32 equally spaced, non-collinear diffusion gradient directions (b =1000 s mm<sup>−2</sup>) to ensure identical angular resolution and noise characteristics. T2*W sequences were TE matched and kept a similar TR to ensure comparable weighting. FLAIR sequences had identical inversion times and were also TE matched with long enough TRs to ensure no T1 weighting occurred. Resolution for T2*W and FLAIR sequences varied between sites; Supplementary Table S1 gives an overview of the exact scanner and sequence details per site.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic variables</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (S.D.)/number (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, mean (S.D.) years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.2 (9.07)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">64 (58.7%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Premorbid IQ</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">115.8 (8.12)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MoCA &lt;26</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">54 (49.5%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">150 (13)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">85 (12)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Previous stroke, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (19.3%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypercholesterolaemia, n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84 (77.1%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (22.0%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current smokers, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (14.7%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Former smokers, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 (37.7%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Angina, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (6.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myocardial infarction, CABG or coronary angioplasty, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (5.5%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peripheral vascular disease, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1.9%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">History of depression,<italic toggle="yes"> n</italic> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (18.3%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Other missing data not previously reported; former smoker =3; peripheral vascular disease =1.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>MRI data analysis</title><p>In addition to DTI, measures describing WMH, lacunes and brain volume are frequently investigated as potential markers of SVD [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

The native space brain volumes were multiplied by this scaling factor to provide normalized brain volumes (NBVs).

Briefly, DTI scans were eddy current corrected with eddy_correct using the first acquired b =0 s mm<sup>−2</sup> image as the reference. A binary brain mask in DTI space was calculated for each subject using "BET" on the same b =0 acquisition. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were then calculated from these data using "DTIFIT". Voxels with MD values above 0.0026 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> were removed from analyses in case they had been misclassified as CSF voxels by application of a diffusivity threshold. Likewise, spurious voxels with FA &gt;1 were also removed. For each participant, FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT, [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], using the normalized mutual information cost function in FSL) was used to register the FLAIR to the T1W image and the T1W to the b0 image (the average of all the b =0 s mm<sup>−2</sup> images in the DTI sequence). These affine transformation matrices were concatenated to create a third FLAIR-to-DTI transformation. TPMs and WMH lesion masks were registered into DTI space using the T1W-to-DTI (trilinear interpolation) and FLAIR-to-DTI (nearest neighbour interpolation) transforms for TPMs and binary WMH lesion masks respectively.</p><p>A hard segmentation method was applied to generate maps of tissue classes. This was achieved by voxelwise comparison of the GM, WM and CSF TPMs, with each voxel being assigned to the highest probability tissue class. The WMH lesion masks were then added with these lesion voxels being automatically assigned to WMH. Finally, mask images of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and all white matter (WM) were generated from the hard segmentation map.</p><p>Histogram analysis was performed on FA and MD maps in both NAWM and WM. Normalized histograms with 1000 bins (FA range: 0–1, bin width: 0.001; MD range: 0–4 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> × 10<sup>−3</sup>, bin width: 0.004 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> × 10<sup>−3</sup>) were computed and median, peak height and peak value were extracted from these for both FA and MD.

This pipeline was structured as a method of selecting the most appropriate MRI measure per type (e.g. one brain tissue volume measurement or MD/FA histogram parameter for DTI) so that contributions of MRI metrics could be assessed together, while avoiding issues of multicollinearity. Thus, in Simple models, the association of NBV, WMH lesion load, lacunes and histogram parameters (from NAWM and WM) were separately investigated against each outcome measure (cognitive domains, QoL and MoCA). As there were multiple NBV and DTI variables, the most significant of each type (or if <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value was the same, the one with the largest β-value) per outcome measure, was selected and used in the Complex model. Here, NBV, WMH lesion load, n° lacunes and DTI measures were included together to assess their contributions relative to each other. Separate Complex models were performed for each outcome measure, in WM and NAWM. These models controlled for confounding effects of age, gender, premorbid IQ and were stratified by study site. Residuals were inspected for normality for all regression analyses while variance inflation factors were also calculated for the Complex models to assess multicollinearity.</p><p>Further analyses compared DTI and outcome variables between sites and repeated some Complex model analyses using site-specific data.

Comparing the magnitude of the DTI-based β-values (ignoring direction, as this will be influenced by the specific DTI parameter used, which differs between papers) from the presented study for the same cognitive domain shows that these fell within or were higher than these previously reported CIs for Global cognition (our β =<bold>0.268</bold>, previous CIs = <bold>–0.22</bold> to –<bold>0.06</bold> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and <bold>–0.38</bold>–<bold>0.02</bold> [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) Executive functioning (i.e. Mental flexibility; our β =<bold>0.306</bold>, previous CIs = <bold>–0.16</bold> to <bold>–0.06</bold> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and <bold>0.05</bold>–<bold>0.39</bold> [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), Verbal fluency (our β =<bold>0.376</bold>, previous CIs = <bold>–0.21</bold> to <bold>–0.02</bold> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and Verbal Memory (our β =<bold>0.099</bold>, previous CIs = <bold>–0.28</bold> to <bold>–0.06</bold> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).

Comparison of all outcome measures (i.e. cognitive domains, MoCA and QoL scales) between sites by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis also showed no significant findings (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value range: 0.192–0.827).</p><p>‘Complex model’ analyses were also repeated at sites 1, 2 and 3 individually. These were repeated in cases where a DTI metric had been shown to have a significant relationship with a cognitive domain in the main analyses. These relationships were further visualized by scatterplot in <italic toggle="yes">all</italic> sites, with the 95% CI around the total regression line also included for comparison. Complex model results showed sites 1 and 2 to have β-values which were within or higher than the 95% CI limits for the same comparison in the main analyses. While this was also true for site 3 in the Global cognition model, the Mental flexibility and Verbal fluency models gave a lower β-value than the CI limits. The scatterplot with the ‘weakest’ (i.e. flattest) individual site fit is included here as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. This shows the relationship between WM FA median and Mental flexibility, with a weak fit for site 4 (but not site 3) in that its line falls outside the total CI limits in a manner showing it to be flatter. Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 repeat this scatterplot for Global cognition and Verbal fluency comparisons and likewise indicate site 3 (but not site 4) to have a weak fit in each. All other sites show either good fits (i.e. fall completely within the CI limits; see site 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) or ‘strong’ ones (i.e. fall outside the total CI limits in a manner showing them to have steeper slopes; see sites 2, 3 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that the majority of sites do contribute to the main study findings. It is possible that individual cases of small Complex model β-values, and unusually ‘weak’/‘strong’ scatterplot fits are due to lack of power from low sample sizes.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A scatterplot showing the relationship between WM FA median and Mental flexibility, stratified by study site.</p><p>In addition to individual site regression lines, the regression line for the total is also included with accompanying 95% CI limits (black, dashed line).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="CS-2017-0146i002.jpg"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this analysis of baseline data from a multicentre clinical trial of SVD, we found associations between DTI metrics and cognition of a similar magnitude to those reported in previous single-centre studies. This provides support for the use of DTI measures as surrogate markers in clinical trials of SVD.</p><p>We found that both DTI markers and lacunar infarct count were independently associated with Global cognition and MoCA results. Additionally, DTI markers were independently associated with Mental flexibility and Verbal fluency, and lacunes with Processing speed and SSQoL. In contrast, we found no independent associations between WMH lesion load and cognition and only two for brain volume (with MoCA and EuroQoL). This is in-line with most previous literature from single-centre studies, which have found weak or absent associations between WMH and cognition in patients with severe symptomatic SVD [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, it has been previously shown, as we also have, that the presence and number of lacunar infarcts [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the extent of diffuse WM damage assessed on DTI [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], are the strongest predictors of cognitive functioning. Furthermore, both have been shown to predict risk of dementia in longitudinal studies [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], while lacunes and the apparent diffusion coefficient (a diffusion-weighted imaging measure highly similar to MD) have also been shown to predict future cognitive decline [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Number of lacunes was chosen in the present study instead of lacune volume as it is a more practical measure to obtain in a clinical setting, and similar associations with cognitive performance have been found between these in a comparable severe SVD population [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials of new agents in SVD will need to be multicentre and if MRI is to be used as a surrogate marker, it is important to evaluate how the different markers perform in a multicentre setting. While research in other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Huntington’s [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] disease have shown that DTI markers of disease can be successfully applied in a mutlicentre study, there have been few studies addressing this issue in SVD. The use of multiple scanners, possibly from different manufacturers, is likely to add noise and may diminish the statistical sensitivity of these metrics.</p><p>PRESERVE is one of the first studies to use advanced MRI as a surrogate marker in SVD trials. In this setting, we have shown that the magnitudes of associations between DTI and cognition are highly comparable with previous, single-centre studies, further validating the use of these metrics in this context. Additionally, while WM and NAWM DTI were always significantly associated with the same outcomes, the strengths of these associations was consistently descriptively greater in WM models. This indicates the simpler process of obtaining a WM mask is at least equally valid and may be more practical in a clinical setting. It should also be noted that previous research has indicated through power calculations that DTI parameters could detect change with much smaller sample sizes than lacunes, due to the frequency of new lacunes being relatively low [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggests that DTI metrics may be the most powerful surrogate marker of the two.</p><p>Examination of individual site data did demonstrate some variation in the strength of associations between MR parameters and cognition from different centres, but the majority of these effect sizes were within (or greater than) the expected ranges as determined by 95% CIs for β-values and regression slopes from the main analyses. DTI metrics and cognition did not significantly differ between sites, meaning that it is likely that a lack of power due to a low site sample size was a contributing factor to the instances where this was not the case. The similarity of DTI and cognitive metrics across sites also suggests good comparability between the centres involved in the present study. With respect to the wider literature however, the authors do note that DTI metrics have sometimes been shown to differ in magnitude between manufacturers, such as one paper where MD values were found to be systematically higher on Siemens compared with Philips scanners (this would not affect peak height of MD as used in the presented study, but could affect measures of MD centrality [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Another paper [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] examined reproducibility of whole brain MD peak height between a 1.5T and a 3T Siemens scanner in a sample size of seven CADASIL patients, which achieved an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.752 (indicating ‘good’ reliability [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). A further paper has found that scanner upgrades to affect DTI after scanning CADASIL patients [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These findings show that caution should be used when combining DTI data from different manufacturers or when taking measurements over time and future research may wish to take this into account in analyses. These considerations also highlight the importance of conducting multicentre scanner calibration and standardization of acquisition protocols prior to study commencement, as well as on-going quality control checks during the study duration in multicentre research of this nature.</p><p>There were some limitations to the present study. There were variable sample sizes across sites, meaning the influence of some centres is much stronger than others on our findings. In particular, having a greater number of participants scanned on non-Philips hardware would have provided more information about the comparability across scanners. The lack of data on inter-scanner reproducibility is also limiting and would have been valuable in more closely judging the sensitivity of these metrics across sites. It would also have been advantageous to acquire a field map with the DTI protocol so that corrections for susceptibility induced distortions could have been made. However registration to DTI space did appear good, so this is unlikely to have caused any major problems.</p><p>To conclude, in a multicentre study, we have shown that DTI metrics and lacune count correlate with cognition to a similar degree to that found in single-centre studies. Our findings support the use of DTI as a surrogate marker of SVD in multicentre studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Clinical perspectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>DTI metrics have been suggested as clinical trial markers of SVD, but studies investigating this have been single-centre and as clinical trials are likely to be multicentre.

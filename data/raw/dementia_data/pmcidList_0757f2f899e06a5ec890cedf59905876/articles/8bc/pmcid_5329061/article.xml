The gray matter regions of brain are interconnected by white matter tracts, together forming one integrative complex network. In this article, we report our investigation about the potential of applying brain connectivity patterns as an aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We performed pattern analysis of graph theoretical measures derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data representing structural brain networks of 45 subjects, consisting of 15 patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 patients of MCI, and 15 healthy subjects (CT). We considered pair-wise class combinations of subjects, defining three separate classification tasks, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, and CT-MCI, and used an ensemble classification module to perform the classification tasks. Our ensemble framework with feature selection shows a promising performance with classification accuracy of 83.3% for AD vs. MCI, 80% for AD vs. CT, and 70% for MCI vs. CT. Moreover, our findings suggest that AD can be related to graph measures abnormalities at Brodmann areas in the sensorimotor cortex and piriform cortex. In this way, node redundancy coefficient and load centrality in the primary motor cortex were recognized as good indicators of AD in contrast to MCI. In general, load centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality were found to be the most relevant network measures, as they were the top identified features at different nodes. The present study can be regarded as a “proof of concept” about a procedure for the classification of MRI markers between AD dementia, MCI, and normal old individuals, due to the small and not well-defined groups of AD and MCI patients. Future studies with larger samples of subjects and more sophisticated patient exclusion criteria are necessary toward the development of a more precise technique for clinical diagnosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>ensemble classification</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor images</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>graph measures</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="11"/><ref-count count="96"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="12386"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (Heron and National Center for Health Statistics, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). AD is the most common form of dementia and currently affects over five million Americans. This number will grow to as many as 14 million by year 2050 (Brookmeyer et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). AD may affect people in different ways, but the most common first symptom is the inability to remember new information (Burns and Iliffe, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The progression of AD toward other brain regions causes disruption of the daily life, changes in personality, and withdrawal from work and social activities. In advanced stages, the individual is unable to communicate with others and to recognize close relatives. Finally, difficulty executing motor tasks precedes death (Alzheimer's Association, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). There is currently no cure for AD, while most drugs only alleviate the symptoms (Jack et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The transitional stage in which the patient is not considered normal, but does not meet the criteria for dementia is called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI consists of heterogeneous symptomatology, and includes prodromal AD stages as well as mild stages of other types of dementing disorders (Dubois and Albert, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Promodal AD brains have partial similarities to more severe AD brains, while mild stages of other types of dementing disorders have different features by which it would be possible to distinguish non-AD MCI patients from the AD patients.</p><p>According to the International Working Group-2 (IWG-2) criteria by Dubois et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the diagnostic biomarkers for AD are the clinical phenotype (typical or atypical presentations of AD related neuropsychological deficits), as well as the pathophysiologic presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, as defined by Alzheimer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1907</xref>), which are associated with synaptic loss, functional neurotransmission deficits, and neuronal death. The pathophysiologic markers of AD can be accessed by positron emission tomography (PET; Drzezga et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and cerebrospinal fluid tests (Tapiola et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Topographic biomarkers such as F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (PET-FDG; Bohnen et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) hippocampal volumetry (Sarazin et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) are proposed to track disease progression.</p><p>The diagnosis of MCI due to AD is possible nowadays (Alzheimer's Association, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dubois et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), based on cognitive impairments with mild impact on the daily activities, and considering some excluding clinical criteria. The diagnosis is also possible based on positive physio-pathologic markers of AD such as an abnormal level of amyloid beta and/or tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or an abnormal load of amyloid beta and/or tau in the brain as revealed by PET. Parallel early evidences of AD are reduction of brain metabolism in the parietal, temporal and hippocampal regions measured by FDG-PET, and hippocampal atrophy revealed by structural MRI.</p><p>In recent years, structural MRI experiments (e.g., Wolz et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Casanova et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lillemark et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have revealed prospective biomarkers with top achievements reaching values superior to 80%. However, it is not yet clear if structural MRI is able to detect earlier biomarkers of AD compared to other MRI modalities, such as functional and diffusion MRI. Several studies have investigated the use of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI), a non-invasive method for automatic diagnosis of brain diseases (e.g., Chen et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Brier et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hoekzema et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zeng et al., <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Chen et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) achieved accuracy slightly higher than 80%. In that approach, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of pairwise regions of interests (ROIs) was used for distinguishing AD patients from healthy subjects in a group analysis. However, given that the correlation coefficient represents only a linear relationship, it follows that if the underlying ground truth is not linear, the result of such an analysis will be inaccurate. Furthermore, the above approach cannot be applied to diagnosing individual patients in a clinical setting as the correlation analysis is calculated on group data. Hence, to study the complexities of brain networks and to identify brain disorders (e.g., AD) only by studying the rs-fMRI correlation between different brain regions may not be sufficient. A more advanced approach is necessary to study the complexities of brain networks, and the diagnosis of single subject data.</p><p>Complex networks can be analyzed efficiently using graph theory. Graph theory models each brain region as a node and the relationship between two regions as an edge. Recent studies have focused on the use of graph theoretical measures on the structural brain networks (Bassett et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Bassett and Bullmore, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bullmore and Sporns, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Lynall et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Várkuti et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Khazaee et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Depending on the type of data, various graphs can be constructed. For example, representations of neural networks can be constructed using microscopic data (e.g., Chatterjee and Sinha, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), where nodes represent neurons and edges axons connecting neurons to each other. Recent studies have shown that graph theoretical measures are vital in identifying network measures of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Graph theory not only can be used to study various network properties such as small-world property or efficiency of the information transfer, but it can also be employed in medical applications and disease diagnosis. For example, Bassett et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used graph theoretic methods to show that patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia have abnormal network configurations.</p><p>Recently, machine learning has been used in the detection of diseases by recognizing physiological patterns (biomarkers) of healthy and pathological conditions (Teipel et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mapstone et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There has been a growing interest in applying machine learning techniques on DTI data of Alzheimer's patients (Hahn et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recent studies have derived connection matrices as well as graph metrics from DTI data (Lo et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) of Alzheimer's patients. Dyrba et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) report a machine learning approach for discriminating between Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls using fractional anisotropy (FA) values as input features, achieving 80% of accuracy. However, these studies have used information such as Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient between brain regions (Wang et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF; Dai et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and a limited number of network measures as discriminant features (Li et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Additionally, these studies considered only global network measures but ignored local network measures. Local network measures that are indicators of individual network elements (such as nodes or links) typically quantify connectivity profiles associated with these elements and reflect the way in which these elements are embedded in the network. Hence, one major focus of the current research is to identify more effective local and global structural properties of the brain network to enhance the performance of pattern classification.</p><p>The purpose of current study is to implement a system that efficiently classifies AD patients from MCI patients and healthy subjects (CT). We analyzed DTI data of 15 AD patients, 15 MCI patients, and 15 healthy volunteers, and performed pattern classification of the three categories of subjects based on graph measures. We considered pair-wise class combinations of subjects and defined three separate classification tasks, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, and CT-MCI. An ensemble classification module was used to perform the classification tasks. A limitation of this study is the small sample of amnesic MCI, as those could be a mix of people with AD and other dementing disorders such as dementia with Lewy body dementia. Due to the limited sample size, this study can be regarded as a “proof of concept.”</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was performed in three stages: data collection and processing, feature extraction, and classification. Data acquisition was performed in an MR scanner, and data processing included a preprocessing phase containing realignment, coregistration, normalization, and segmentation of the data. Fractional anisotropy based tractography, and feature extraction was performed based on graph theory by calculating local network centrality measures (Freeman, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Pattern classification was performed by the method of ensemble classification (Rokach, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><sec><title>Data collection and processing</title><sec><title>Subjects and data acquisition</title><p>Forty-five adults consisting of 15 AD patients, 15 MCI patients, and 15 healthy volunteers were recruited for DTI data acquisition. DTI scans were acquired in the Institute D'or (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) on a Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla MR scanner, using a spin echo (SE) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 5620 ms, echo time (TE) = 65 ms, flip angle = 90°, acquisition matrix = 96 × 96 with a spatial resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 mm, 60 transversal slices with thickness = 2.5 mm, 32 gradient directions, and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic>-value 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The adults in study were referred for neuropsychological evaluation by their physicians, because of memory complaints to discriminate among normal aging, MCI, or dementia. Participants with tumor, stroke, traumatic brain injury, or hydrocephalus were excluded from the experiment. AD and MCI diagnoses were made by consensus among a trained, a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist, based on DSM-IV criteria, MRI overview, clinical data and neuropsychological tests. The AD patients had mild dementing disorders and the supportive tests for first AD diagnosis were performed in parallel to the MR/DTI acquisition. AD diagnoses were performed considering NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (Knopman et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). All individuals underwent a comprehensive evaluation for diagnostic propose, including the following tests, whose quantitative results are available in the Appendix (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">A2</xref>) in Supplementary Material:

We did not apply the Hachinski Ischemic Scale. We used Petersen criteria (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) for MCI diagnosis, including:

The connectivity regions of participants' DTI data were defined in terms of Brodmann areas.

ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), and segmentation by using the software, DSI Studio (Yeh and Tseng, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). FA was calculated for each voxel of each subject's brain volume, generating a FA map for each subject. FA is commonly considered to be an indicator of structural brain connectivity, since it is sensitive to the axonal structure (Basser and Pierpaoli, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Important factors influencing FA is the integrity of axons and their myelin sheaths (Damoiseaux et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Subsequently, tractography (Le Bihan and Breton, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), a 3D modeling technique that visually represents neural tracts using DTI data, was performed to obtain the Connectome (Sporns et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Tractography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was performed deterministically by using the entire brain as the seed with the toolbox, DSI Studio (Kreher et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Yeh et al., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This process was performed according to the following parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold = 0.1, number of seed points = 1,000,000, maximum angle = 60°, step size = 1.25 mm, length constraint = 25–100 mm, and no spatial smoothing<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Connectivity matrices were obtained and stored accordingly. We considered 41 Brodmann areas according to the coordinates established in DSI studio (Yeh et al., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In a connectivity matrix, rows and columns of the matrix represent different Brodmann areas. Each cell of the matrix represents a distinct connection between two Brodmann areas corresponding to specific row and column.

The interpretation of the connectivity matrix as a graph allows the extraction of the graph features. These graph features can then be used in a machine learning framework. The machine learning module includes the following procedures: hyper-parameter setting, feature selection, and classification based on a nested cross-validation procedure.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fnins-11-00056-g0002.jpg"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Feature extraction</title><sec><title>Graph generation and construction of structural brain networks</title><p>In graph theory, a graph is defined as a set of nodes and edges (Bullmore and Sporns, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Using connectivity matrices obtained above, we generated the corresponding graphs where the nodes are brain regions and edges are the bundles of nerves connecting those regions (Gong et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this manner, a graph was generated for each subject using the connectivity matrices generated in the previous data processing. The graphs we constructed were all undirected, i.e., the nodes are connected together by bidirectional edges. Brodmann areas were represented as network nodes. Based on the 41 Brodmann areas considered in this analysis, each network was composed by a total of 41 nodes. An edge was marked between two nodes, representing two Brodmann areas, if there was at least one fiber connecting them. Otherwise these two nodes were not considered directly connected, although they could still be connected via another node or nodes. We used the weight (W<sub>ij</sub>) value of the edge to describe the strength of the connectivity of Brodmann areas <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>. We constructed the connectivity matrix as a weighted matrix for each subject. As there were 41 Brodmann areas, the maximum number of all possible edges was 820 [<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> − 1)/2; <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 41]. The number of nodes (41) was the same for each subject since each brain was parcellated using the same scheme. However, subjects differed in the structure of their graph in terms of both the number and weighting on the edges. The numbers of edges were likely to differ for different graphs as the result of varying strengths and presence/absence of the connectivity of Brodmann areas in the subjects.

The numbers on the nodes represent the label of the Brodmann areas. The diameter of each node is proportional to the number of connections of its corresponding Brodmann areas, and the thickness of each line represents the weight or connection strength of the edge.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fnins-11-00056-g0003.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Extracting graph features</title><p>The network properties that we computed included the following: closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) centrality, degree centrality, clustering coefficient centrality, load centrality, and efficiency and node redundancy coefficient (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Using a priority system, the commodity is passed to the neighbors of the node that are closest to the target destination.

In machine learning, hyper-parameter tuning refers to the problem of finding the best set of parameters for a model (Bergstra and Bengio, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the module automatically performs an exhaustive search over various parameter values for an estimator and finds the best performing set of parameters for the given estimator, using the grid search approach (Chang and Lin, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In this approach, a (multi-dimensional) grid of parameters is defined for the estimator and the cross validation technique is used for searching over the grid, and identifying the best performing set of parameters. After finding the best set of parameters for the estimator, we selected the best set of features automatically; using another five-fold nested cross validation module, and performed the classification tasks, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, MCI-CT. In five-fold cross validation, the classification is performed in five iterations, separately for each pair-wise class combination of patients, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, MCI-CT. Each iteration was divided into three steps: feature selection/hyper-parameter tuning, classifier training and classification.

This process was done five times in order to apply classification to all the subjects. We implemented a five-fold nested cross validation (NCV) as the training phase included setting the hyper-parameters of the model and selecting the features. Through NCV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), an outer cross validation was used to evaluate the accuracy and performance of an inner cross validation in which the hyper-parameters were tuned or the features were selected for the learning process.

The central assumption when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains many redundant or irrelevant features. Redundant features are those which are repeated and provide no extra information compared to the currently selected features, while irrelevant features are those which do not provide any useful information. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples, as is our problem. We implemented a nested cross validation module to test various feature selection methods for all the three classification tasks, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, and CT-MCI.

In <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>-best feature selection, the features are ranked based on their power in performing the classification, and then the top <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> features are selected for the given estimator. The features were ranked based on the ANOVA <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>-value between features. The number of top features, i.e., <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>, should be manually defined.

After tuning the hyper-parameters and selecting the most informative features, the classification was done using the ensemble classification method. In ensemble learning, multiple classifiers are used such that the ensemble classification system outperforms all of the constituent classifiers (Opitz and Maclin, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Dietterich, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Ensemble classifiers become even more advantageous if classifiers with different decision boundaries are used, allowing for more flexibility through promoting diversity among the models (Brown et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The ensemble learning is very similar to human behavior in making important decisions. Especially in case of medical diagnosis, humans prefer to increase the reliability of their decision through asking the opinion of various doctors (Sesmero et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We simulated the same process in our system by generating a diverse set of base classifiers whose decision boarders complement each other, and combining their outputs such that the accuracy of the classification was improved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, the ensemble learner was built in two phases: (1) generating a set of diverse base classifiers, and (2) combining the decisions made by the base classifiers to obtain one decision.</p><fig id="F7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The ensemble classifier design</bold>. The data is provided to a set of diverse base classifiers and their decisions are then combined through a voting procedure to obtain the final classification result. The whole process was performed within a nested five-fold cross validation module.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fnins-11-00056-g0007.jpg"/></fig><p>The diversity of the base classifiers is of high importance. The diversity of two given classifiers is high if they result in errors at different samples (Sesmero et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). If a pair of classifiers is not diverse, then the decision made by each of them might be similar, therefore, the final ensemble decision will not improve. But if the decision boarders of a pair of classifiers complement each other, we can expect an improved performance for the ensemble classifier. Although the diversity of base learners is a mandatory condition for a good ensemble, there is no consensus on quantifying the diversity (Kuncheva and Whitaker, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). We considered pair-wise combinations of the base classifiers candidates and calculated the Q metric as a proxy for diversity. Equation (10) shows the definition of the Q metric (Sesmero et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><disp-formula id="E10"><label>(10)</label><mml:math id="M10" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>00</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>00</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula><p>In Equation (10), <italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">ij</italic></sup> is the number of samples that were classified correctly (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = 1) or incorrectly (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = 0) by the first classifier in the pair, and correctly (<italic toggle="yes">j</italic> = 1) or incorrectly (<italic toggle="yes">j</italic> = 0) by the second classier in the pair. The lower the Q is for a pair of base classifiers, the more diversity the pair has. We tested various combinations of base learners and found that the combination of logistic regression, random forest, gaussian naïve bayes, 1-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines performs the best for the defined classification tasks. We then used voting for combining the decisions made by the base classifiers and obtaining the final classification result (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In voting approach, the final classification decision on a new sample, i.e., <italic toggle="yes">C(x)</italic>, is made through voting on all the base classifiers (<italic toggle="yes">BC</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>), each having a weight of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, as stated in Equation (11) (Rokach, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><disp-formula id="E11"><label>(11)</label><mml:math id="M11" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula><p>In Equation (11), <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> is the number of base classifiers (in our case, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5). The preliminary weights of the base classifiers were first generated within the hyper-parameter setting procedure. We then refined the weights by testing various combinations of weights and determined the best weighting set for each of the classification tasks. Intuitively, we assigned larger weights to more accurate classifiers, or set of classifiers with complementary decision boarders. The entire classification process was performed within a nested five-fold cross validation module, as explained before in the cross validation section. The classification module generates a positive (+1) or negative (−1) label for each subject corresponding to the input labels, e.g., AD = +1 and CT = −1 in AD-CT task. After that, this output can be compared with the input label (neuropsychological diagnosis) in order to measure the success level of the approach. Success in classification is achieved when the output label from the classifier is equivalent to the input label. Accuracy of classification is the percentage of correctly predicted (or detected) output labels for all subjects from both positive and negative input classes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>We evaluated our model on 45 subjects, comprising 15 AD patients, 15 MCI patients, and 15 healthy volunteers. A total number of 451 features was calculated for each subject from which 430, 430, and 110 features were selected as the most informative features for AD-CT, AD-MCI, and MCI-CT classification tasks, respectively. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> shows the performance metrics calculated for the base classifiers as well as the ensemble technique with and without feature selection module. The feature selection module was considered for all the base classifiers during the evaluation stage, as it improved their performance. As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the ensemble framework with feature selection outperforms all the other listed classifiers, and shows a promising performance. The ensemble framework with feature selection resulted in a classification accuracy of 83.3% for AD vs. MCI, 80% for AD vs. CT, and 70% for MCI vs. CT. Accuracy of the classification was defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. We also checked for the recall metric defined as the number of true-positives divided by the number of true-positives and false-negatives, i.e., <italic toggle="yes">Recall</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">TP</italic>/(<italic toggle="yes">TP</italic>+<italic toggle="yes">FN</italic>). According to Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the recall is 80, 80, and 50% for AD-CT, AD-MCI, and MCI-CT classification tasks, respectively. Recall can be considered as a measure of completeness of a classifier such that a low recall can indicate the high number of false-negatives. Recall can be also regarded as a sensitivity measure since it evaluates the effectiveness of a classifier in identifying the positive labels (Sokolova and Lapalme, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Finally, we checked the F-1 score of the classifiers. The F-1 score is useful if we want to select a classification model such that it holds a balance between precision and recall. Theoretically, the F-1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, i.e., 2(<italic toggle="yes">Precision</italic>
<sup>*</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">Recall</italic>)/(<italic toggle="yes">Precision</italic>+<italic toggle="yes">Recall</italic>), in which the precision is the number of true-positives divided by true-positives and false-positives. As it is seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the F-1 score of the ensemble framework with feature selection is 79.8, 82.5, and 66.7% for AD-CT, AD-MCI, and MCI-CT classification

Moreover, these results indicate that Alzheimer's disease affects Brodmann areas in the sensorimotor cortex and piriform cortex, where we found abnormalities in out measures. The piriform cortex, whose load centrality has been shown as a good discriminative feature for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by our results, has an important role in olfactory perception (Howard et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The piriform cortex is located at the junction of the temporal and frontal lobes and is the neighbor of the entorhinal cortex (Mai et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The entorhinal cortex is known in the literature as one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer disease (Khan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

In relation to these findings in the primary motor cortex (and in other brain regions), it is important to point out that abnormalities in node redundancy coefficient and load centrality do not mean variations in the connectivity at that exact location. Degree is the only network measure that is directly correlated to connectivity changes in the specific node (in this case primary motor cortex). As Degree is not one of the abnormal measures, it indicates that abnormal connectivity patterns at primary motor cortex are not a relevant feature for AD diagnosis. The relevant network measures revealed here (node redundancy coefficient and load centrality) indicate that connectivity abnormalities on AD are occurring in parallel (in circuit terms) in brain pathways that cross primary motor cortex, which together generate these network patterns found at the primary motor cortex. In other words, the primary motor cortex does not represent the primary effect, rather than the secondary effect of the pathology.</p><p>Our findings identified measures in the primary sensory cortex (betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, load centrality, closeness centrality, and Katz centrality), somatosensory association cortex (degree and closeness centralities) and primary motor cortex (node redundancy coefficient and load centrality) as good discriminative features for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, while measures at the premotor cortex (HITS centrality, page rank, betweenness centrality, and load centrality) were identified as good discriminative features for MCI diagnosis<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref>.</p><p>Therefore, load centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were found to be the most relevant network measures in our study, as they were the top identified features at different nodes. Other measures, as eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, degree centrality, node redundancy coefficient, HITS centrality, page rank and hub centrality were also recognized as relevant features for classifications among Alzheimer's disease patients, MCI patients, and healthy controls.</p><p>The accuracy value achieved in our study can be compared to what other researches performed using other modalities of MRI, such as structural (Wolz et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Casanova et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lillemark et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), functional (Chen et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and voxel-based diffusion (Dyrba et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). All those studies, as well as ours, achieved accuracies in the range of 80–90%. While structural MRI can reveal localized deformations, diffusion MRI based network analysis has the potential to help the development of new pathologic brain segmentation atlases grouping brain matter according to their network patterns. In this way, our paper shows that the use of graph measures as feature of diffusion MRI data can run in parallel to the application of other modalities toward finding biomarkers of AD. The combination of features from these different modalities may considerably increase the potential of the AD diagnosis. Therefore, the development of methods which efficiently combines these multimodal features is a field to be explored by next studies. Nevertheless, our results indicate that complex graph measures may effectively be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the small sample size (15 subjects for each of the three classes). Therefore, this study is a “proof of concept” about a procedure for the classification of MRI markers between AD dementia, MCI, and normal old individuals. The reliability of these results can be tested later in a complementary study based on a larger sample size (at least 100 subjects per class). It is also important to remark that the small sample of amnesic MCI could be a mix of people with AD and other dementing disorders, such as dementia with Lewy body dementia. Due to these facts, the moderate classification between control subjects and MCI in this study does not mean an ability of the procedure to disentangle between normality and the prodromal stages of AD. However, although the sample size is small, it is quite encouraging that the proposed ensemble classification framework which included a well-tuned feature selection component and was validated within a five-fold cross validation module, resulted in quite good classification performance. We expect larger sample would help the system to better distinguish between the AD and non-AD groups. A longitudinal study can assign at what time-point in the evolution of the disease each region is more likely to be affected by Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, longitudinal studies may have the potential to reveal first evidences of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Finally, supervised classification approach requires a set of labeled observations (Bishop, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), thus making it highly dependent on the ground truth provided by the diagnosis of the clinicians. Assuming that there is a possibility of misdiagnosis, unsupervised classification techniques, such as K-Means clustering (Lloyd, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Jain et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), can be used to improve the reliability of classifications.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of ‘International Guidelines for Biomedical Research involving human beings, Declaration of Helsinki’ and ‘Resolution 196/96, Brazilian National Health Council’.

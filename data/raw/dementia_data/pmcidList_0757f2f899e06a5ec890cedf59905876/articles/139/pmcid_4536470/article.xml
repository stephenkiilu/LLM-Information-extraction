Global connectivity of networks has been found impaired in clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively healthy aging. We hypothesized that network alterations are detectable already in preclinical AD and investigated major global WM network properties. Other structural markers of neurodegeneration typically affected in prodromal AD but seeming largely unimpaired in preclinical AD were also examined.</p><p>12 cognitively healthy elderly with preclinical AD as classified by florbetapir-PET (mean age 73.4 ± 4.9) and 31 age-matched controls without cerebral amyloidosis (mean age 73.1 ± 6.7) from the ADNI were included. WM networks were reconstructed from DTI using tractography and graph theory. Indices of network capacity and the established imaging markers of neurodegeneration hippocampal volume, and cerebral glucose utilization as measured by fludeoxyglucose-PET were compared between the two groups. Additionally, we measured surrogates of global WM integrity (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, volume).</p><p>We found an increase of shortest path length and a decrease of global efficiency in preclinical AD. These results remained largely unchanged when controlling for WM integrity. In contrast, neither markers of neurodegeneration nor WM integrity were altered in preclinical AD subjects.</p><p>Our results suggest an impairment of WM networks in preclinical AD that is detectable while other structural imaging markers do not yet indicate incipient neurodegeneration.

Biomarkers have been arranged along a hypothetical timeline, on which cerebral amyloid (Amyloid-β) deposition is assumed to be a very early event of AD, followed by synaptic dysfunction, hypometabolism and cortical and subcortical atrophy as markers of neurodegeneration (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2010</xref>). Histopathological studies of AD showed demyelination and axonal damage, which are likely to result in functionally relevant disconnections between brain areas in addition to a specific pattern of structural gray matter defects (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Delbeuck et al., 2003</xref>). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used successfully to detect deterioration of white matter (WM) integrity in vivo in AD and prodromal AD (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux et al., 2009</xref>). Studies investigating WM in preclinical AD as of yet are rare and show heterogeneous results, reporting regional increases (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Racine et al., 2014</xref>) and decreases of indices of WM integrity (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2013</xref>), or even both (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>). However they suggest early alterations of WM in AD.</p><p>Surrogates of whole-brain WM networks reconstructed from DTI and assessed by graph theory are a novel imaging marker that integrates microstructural and topological information of WM (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Iturria-Medina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Iturria-Medina et al., 2008</xref>). Several studies have so far demonstrated impairment of network connectivity both in the prodromal and dementia stages of AD (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Daianu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Wee et al., 2011</xref>), thereby supporting the notion of AD as a disconnection disease. Interestingly, Raj et al. demonstrated that AD cortical atrophy and hypometabolism patterns can be predicted from healthy WM network topology (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2015</xref>). Some of the mechanisms suggested, e.g. a prion-like propagation of disease agents along WM tracts, imply very early involvement of the WM network in AD pathology. Furthermore, a recent longitudinal study by Nir et al. showed that WM network architecture not only predicts cortical atrophy but also AD conversion in patients with mild cognitive impairment at risk for developing AD (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Nir et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings led us to hypothesize that WM network alterations might be detectable even at the preclinical stage of AD. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined group differences of network properties between subjects of preclinical AD, i.e. cognitively normal subjects with Amyloid-β deposition (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Sperling et al., 2011</xref>), and normal controls. For comparison, we also examined other structural imaging markers of neurodegeneration that are known to be affected in prodromal AD, i.e. hippocampal volume and cerebral glucose metabolism. In order to show that WM network alterations are specific to network properties and do not simply reflect global WM integrity, we repeated analyses for WM volume, WM mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and WM mean diffusivity (MD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The data for the present study were obtained from the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu" id="interref360"><underline>http://adni.loni.usc.edu</underline></ext-link>.

One study assessed WM networks reconstructed using DTI fiber tractography in a manner comparable to the present study (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). They reported decreased global efficiency and increased mean shortest path length in AD. The findings of the present study may be interpreted as an extension of these findings to preclinical AD. This means that an impairment of the global structural integration of brain regions is already measurable at the preclinical stage of AD. Notably this is in contrast to normal aging, where global efficiency was found to be preserved (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Assessing the total brain WM has two main advantages over ROI based, voxel-wise or morphometric approaches. First, the networks and their properties integrate more of the information available from imaging scans than either of the approaches cited above. Specifically, microstructural tissue composition (e.g. FA), morphometry (fiber thickness) as well as topology (fiber orientation, interconnection of GM regions) are all condensed into one WM network surrogate and its properties. Second, in addition to information integration, the network property indices provide a straightforward and objective way of quantifying, characterizing and interpreting the data contained in the network. Network property indices such as clustering coefficient, shortest paths and global efficiency intuitively model the efficiency of local and global information traversal and processing and (in the case of DTI networks) have been found to be associated with cognition, age and gender (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>) as well as sensitive to WM pathology (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). These views are supported further by the findings of the present study. The integration of more information available from the imaging data than other approaches is beneficial with respect to detecting alterations in preclinical AD: neither global FA and MD nor total WM volume showed group differences in ANCOVA. We additionally performed voxelwise analyses for group differences between HC and preclinical AD for FA and MD using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) and simple t-test, but none were found (data not shown).</p><p>Cerebral Amyloid-β deposition plays an early key role in the preclinical pathogenesis of AD. However, it is not sufficient by itself for the clinical manifestation of AD. The prodromal phase of AD is instead marked by neurodegenerative processes, whose association with Amyloid-β deposition is an ongoing area of research (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2013</xref>). One of these neurodegenerative processes is an impairment of WM connectivity measurable by DTI. Studies in mouse models have histologically confirmed a negative association of Amyloid-β deposition and WM connectivity (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). However, more recent studies in mice reported contradicting results showing both negative and positive associations (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Shu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Zerbi et al., 2013</xref>). Studies in asymptomatic humans with Amyloid-β deposition are rare, of limited comparability and heterogeneous (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Racine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>). Thus the relationship between amyloid and WM integrity does not seem to be straight forward. Our finding of unaltered FA and MD of total WM as well as at the voxel level (data not shown, please see above) may thus be due to unknown modifying factors, or due to the small sample size.</p><p>The human brain network as reconstructed from various imaging modalities has consistently been shown to exhibit small world organization, where several regions form locally densely connected clusters (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). These clusters are in turn interconnected by network hubs that provide “shortcuts” for efficient information traversal between any region in the network. This network layout is robust to random elimination of nodes, since the number of these network hubs is relatively small compared to overall network size (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2008</xref>). The finding of the present study where shortest paths were increased and global efficiency decreased while network reference values such as size, number of edges and total cost remained unaltered in preclinical AD thus implies degradation of hub regions in preclinical AD (please see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> for network plots). Indeed, there is mounting evidence that hubs are focal areas of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Crossley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2015</xref>). In a supplementary regional analysis, we were able to confirm this view: network nodes with locally impaired connectivity in preclinical AD (i.e. decreased weighted degree) also showed a significantly higher contribution to global network integration (i.e. betweenness centrality, see Appendix A, Quantification of brain networks) than nodes with unaltered connectivity and may thus be regarded as hub regions (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Unlike shortest path length, normalized shortest path length did not show an increase between NC and preclinical AD. This constellation is analogous to findings of other studies that showed consistent increase of shortest path length in patients of AD but heterogeneous results for normalized shortest path length (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Tijms et al., 2013</xref>). This apparent discrepancy may be due to different effects of the normalization depending on underlying network topology (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">van Wijk et al., 2010</xref>). However, as topology could be altered in AD (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Arigita et al., 2010</xref>), this might lead to underestimation of effects.</p><p>Atrophy and hypometabolism have been detected in preclinical AD before by other studies, particularly in the hippocampus (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Chetelat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Mosconi et al., 2008</xref>). However, neither the hippocampus nor the other structural markers of neurodegeneration investigated in this study, i.e. brain volume and FDG uptake, were altered in preclinical AD. This finding implies that WM network impairment may occur before significant neurodegeneration is detectable.</p><p>Integration of different structures spread across the brain is vital for many cognitive functions. It follows that connectivity between these regions has an impact on how well they can synchronize and cooperate to work on a specific task. Indeed, properties of structural and functional whole brain networks have been shown to be associated with cognitive performance in healthy subjects and patients of AD (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, other studies have shown an association of amyloid deposition and cognitive performance (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref47 ref47" ref-type="bibr">Storandt et al., 2009, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Villemagne et al., 2011</xref>). Considering these prior findings together with the altered network indices in preclinical AD as reported by the present study, one might assume cognitive differences between the preclinical AD group and NC that are driven by an association with the networks. However, in an exploratory analysis, we were unable to show either (data not shown). Possible explanations are the small sample size as well as the cognitive tests available with ADNI, which put more emphasis on diagnosis and disease progression monitoring than sensitivity to subtle cognitive differences within the healthy range (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.use.edu/methods/documents/" id="interref368"><underline>http://adni.loni.use.edu/methods/documents/</underline></ext-link>).</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, due to the cross sectional design of the study, group differences between HC and preclinical AD may be due to selection bias. However, we controlled for age, education and sex in all analyses of covariance. Second, the sample size of this study is relatively small and it may not adequately represent the population. Third, the data were acquired at several different centers. However, major efforts for the standardization of data acquisition were undertaken during the design and execution of the ADNI project. Fourth, we refrained from using correction for multiple comparisons in light of the exploratory nature of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using DTI tractography and graph theory we were able to demonstrate that alterations of whole-brain white matter network properties are detectable in preclinical AD even before structural markers of brain atrophy show significant neurodegeneration.

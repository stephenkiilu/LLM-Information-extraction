Twenty-three healthy controls (mean age = 63.4±7.5 years) and seventeen AD patients (mean age = 66.5±6.6 years) were recruited for this study. By combining two imaging techniques—optical coherence tomography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)—the association between changes in the thickness of individual retinal layers and white matter dysfunction in early AD was assessed. Retinal layers were segmented, and thickness measurements were obtained for each layer. DTI images were analyzed with a quantitative data-driven approach to evaluating whole-brain diffusion metrics, using tract-based spatial statistics. Diffusion metrics, such as fractional anisotropy, are markers for white matter integrity. Multivariate and partial correlation analyses evaluating the association between individual retinal layers thickness and diffusion metrics were performed. We found that axial diffusivity, indexing axonal integrity, was significantly reduced in AD (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.016, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.004) while in the retina, only a marginal trend for significance was found for the outer plexiform layer (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.084, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.688). Furthermore, a positive association was found in the AD group between fractional anisotropy and the inner nuclear layer thickness (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.419, corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling family-wise error rate). Our findings suggest that axonal damage in the brain dominates early on in this condition and shows an association with retinal structural integrity already at initial stages of AD. These findings are consistent with an early axonal degeneration mechanism in AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><label>Keywords</label><kwd>Alzheimer’s disease</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor imaging</kwd><kwd>optical coherence

Its incidence increases exponentially with age. Disease hallmarks include plaques, composed of amyloid-β, and tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau [<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. AD pathology starts much before the clinical manifestations of dementia [<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, there is an urgent need to find biomarkers for different pathological processes involved in this disease, preferentially involving non-invasive techniques. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique for cross-sectional imaging of the internal retinal structure. Since the retina develops as an extension of the central nervous system, it has been previously described as an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> window to the brain in some neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many AD patients suffer from complex visual problems, and the severity of these deficits correlates with lower scores in clinical dementia rating [<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. Several studies have reported a significant decrease in the mean overall peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with AD and also mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [<xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while Kromer and colleagues report a reduction only in the nasal superior sector in mild to moderate stages of AD [<xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>However, other studies have questioned the clinical usefulness of peripapillary RNFL thickness, finding no difference between AD, MCI, and healthy controls [<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, no differences were found concerning macular and peripapillary RNFL thickness in early-onset AD [<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Regarding other retinal layers, Cheung and colleagues reported reduced ganglion cell layer (GCL)-inner plexiform layer (IPL) joint thickness in all retinal in all quadrants in AD, with similar results in MCI, suggesting pathological changes in the retina start at early stages of AD [<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Although visual deficits in AD patients have been historically attributed to degenerative damage in primary and associative visual cortical areas, these are not easily explained only by visual cortex dysfunction [<xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>]. This may hint at other mechanisms contributing to the general visual problems that occur during AD [<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Pathological white matter (WM) changes have been documented in at least 50% of patients with AD postmortem [<xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and recent MRI studies have provided further evidence of WM abnormalities in AD [<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>].</p><p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to calculate diffusion metrics—fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (DA)—based on the three diffusion eigenvectors. These indices are indirect and sensitive markers of WM integrity. A recent meta-analysis of DTI in AD revealed that microstructural alterations in WM are widespread throughout the brain in this disease [<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>However, studies assessing OCT measurements together with other biomarkers of neurodegeneration in AD are scarce [<xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we aim to investigate the relation between the integrity of individualized retinal layers and WM tract integrity in the AD brain, evaluating these biological and structural changes at the same point in time in patients diagnosed with AD at a relatively early disease stage. We used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in order to assess whole-brain diffusion metrics, and OCT to measure retinal layers’ thickness, using spectral-domain OCT and a recent algorithm for semi-automated segmentation of retinal layers [<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec0015"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty participants were recruited for this study. All participants in the study gave their written informed consent, approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Coimbra. Participants had no history of ocular diseases and were submitted to a comprehensive ophthalmological examination to guarantee the absence of any visual complication, which comprised visual acuity assessment with Snellen chart, ocular tension (Goldmann applanation tonometer), slit lamp biomicroscopy, and OCT imaging. Only subjects with normal or corrected to normal vision (visual acuity ≥8/10), with refractor error between±5 dioptres, with intraocular pressure ≤21 mmHg, and without apparent alterations of the optic disc or macula, were recruited.</p><p>The clinical group comprised 17 individuals with early AD diagnosis (less than 2 years) recruited and prospectively evaluated by a neurologist (BS and IS), at the Memory Clinic of the Neurology department of the Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra (CHUC). The standard criteria for the diagnosis of AD were the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR) [<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (NINCDS-ADRDA) [<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In order to accomplish these criteria, the diagnostic investigation comprehended a standard clinical evaluation, an extensive cognitive and staging assessment, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and Apolipoprotein E allele genotyping. For this project, we further selected AD patients with a probable diagnosis supported by biological biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or PiB-PET) and patients in mild stages, according to the global staging scale Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR = 1) [<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Considering the neuropsychological evaluation, a comprehensive battery was administered, including: Cognitive instruments as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with Portuguese normative data [<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 28</xref>], the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [<xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29, 30</xref>], and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery with normative data for the Portuguese population (BLAD) [<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] exploring memory and other cognitive domains.</p><p>MRI was considered to support AD diagnosis whenever a dominant pattern of hippocampal and/or posterior parieto-temporal atrophy was present, using visual rating scores. Volumetric analysis is also available but not used for diagnosis in this investigation. CSF samples were collected after a fasting and resting period of 8 h. Pre-analytical and analytical procedures were done in accordance with previously proposed protocols [<xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Briefly, CSF samples were collected in sterile polypropylene tubes, immediately centrifuged at 1,800 g for 10 min at 4°C, aliquoted into polypropylene tubes and stored at –80°C until analysis. CSF Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, Aβ<sub>1–40</sub>, tau, and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>Tau181 were measured in duplicate, by commercially available sandwich ELISAs (Innotest, Innogenetics/Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium), as previously described [<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. External quality control of the measurements was performed under the quality control scheme of the Alzheimer’s Association Quality Control Program for CSF Biomarkers [<xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. CSF biomarkers were classified as normal/abnormal according to previously reported laboratory reference values [<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, we used CSF samples (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 35) from neurological controls (10 male, 25 female; age = 57.3±11.9 years). Most of these individuals suffered from acute or chronic headaches, and a lumbar puncture was performed as part of their routine diagnostic evaluation in order to exclude bleeding or inflammation; in some cases this procedure was considered in the investigation of a peripheral polineuropathy. In both cases, the CSF cytochemical evaluation was normal and a major CNS disease excluded. They had no subjective cognitive complaints and were independent in their instrumental daily life activities, and most of them were still professionally active.

In order to detect possible alterations in the retina and brain in an initial stage of AD, only recently diagnosed patients with mild dementia were considered for our study.</p><p>Regarding the diffusion metrics, we chose to go beyond the more common FA and MD analysis since more elusive orientation dependent behaviors missed by FA can be discovered by considering the primary components of MD—DA and RD. The lack of sensitivity of FA in earlier stages of the AD has been previously reported [<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. DTI-based DA measures water diffusion parallel to axons and is a marker of axonal integrity, while RD assesses water diffusion perpendicular to fibers, related to myelin changes [<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43, 44</xref>].</p><p>We found a decrease in whole-brain DA in our early AD patients’ cohort (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.016, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.004), while other diffusion metrics remained unchanged. This is consistent with the notion that DA changes are one of the first abnormalities to appear in early stages of AD, preceding changes in FA and RD. Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, an early DA change in AD has been proposed to capture an upstream event to axonal degeneration, while processes more directly related to neuronal loss might influence RD and FA changes. A hypothesis for a possible upstream event could be inflammatory change and associated microglial activation, prevalent in AD [<xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Neuroinflammation is a known contributor to the pathogenesis of AD. Analysis of clinical manifestations that precede AD suggest an early and substantial involvement of inflammation in the development of the disease [<xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>However, we have found a significant decrease in DA, while other literature in AD reports an increase. A DA decrease with no alteration of RD has been associated with axonal degeneration with no detectable demyelination [<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47, 48</xref>].</p><p>In AD, deposition of amyloid and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein are primary processes behind neuronal degeneration. In a study assessing the relationship between WM structural integrity measured with DTI and AD-related CSF biomarkers, t-tau and t-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> correlated with indices of brain microstructure (MD, RD, and DA) in healthy adults with elevated risk of developing AD [<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This suggests early pathological changes in AD happen in WM and can be detected by DTI.</p><p>No alteration was found in the retina at this stage of the disease, for any of the layers considered for this study. Only a marginally significant decrease was found for the OPL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the literature, most OCT studies in AD indicate a significant decline in peripapillary (not macular) RNFL in all quadrants [<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 20</xref>] and overall macular thickness [<xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while a study by [<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported macular GCL-IPL reduction. However, no other explicitly segmented retinal layers have been investigated.</p><p>Furthermore, most of these studies have been conducted in patients in later stages of the disease, in mild to moderate or severe AD stages. Considering the degenerative nature of this disease, it would be expected that at higher severity stages the structural integrity of the retina would be more affected, as reported previously by [<xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, since our cohort consists solely of recently diagnosed patients in a mild stage of AD, this might explain why no overt alteration was seen in the retina, as well as the distinct cortical changes in DA. Other possible explanations to this finding include the possible presence of very early AD cases, the relatively small group size considered, or issues with the segmentation analysis or OCT acquisition.</p><p>Nevertheless, we found evidence that the retina already mirrors the brain status in early AD, since we found a significant correlation between FA and the INL thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="jad-70-jad190152-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="jad-70-jad190152-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Thus, the INL thickness might reflect WM tract dysfunction. This relationship was found to extend beyond the visual system, mirroring whole-brain WM (<xref rid="jad-70-jad190152-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Importantly, at over 25% of spatial extent of correlation, we find the splenium of the corpus callosum, the corona radiata, the posterior thalamic radiation including the optical radiation, and the retro lenticular part of the internal capsule—fibers associated with the visual system.</p><p>Since INL and RNFL correspond respectively to cell bodies and their fibers, one would expect to find a similar relation between them. However, no correlation was found between any DTI metrics and RNFL. This could be explained by lower SNR at the RNFL level, precluding detection of a significant correlation.</p><p>Learning the sequence of events in AD would be very important in understanding its pathogenesis. Our findings provide further insight into the interplay of different biomarkers of the disease at rather early stages, when mean changes are quite subtle. The eye, being an extension of the brain, shares functional building blocks in the form of neurons and axons, as well as common degenerative processes [<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These retinocortical connections suggest that direct or indirect retrograde or anterograde degeneration mechanisms [<xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] should be investigated in future research.</p><p>In the present study, we have captured a “snapshot” of an early stage of AD. Based both on our results and on the current literature, we hypothesize the following cascade of events: 1) in an initial stage of the disease, the loss of WM integrity in the brain is related mainly to axonal loss (indexed by axial diffusivity). Its underlying cause, namely possible neuroinflammation [<xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] needs to be explored in future studies. The relation found between FA and INL is also intriguing and suggests concomitant retinocortical changes. 2) With the subsequent cascade of pathological events in AD and at later stages of the disease, RD in the brain increases as demyelination occurs [<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and other inner retinal layers are also progressively affected [<xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>It is important to note that within the human CNS, pathologic inflammatory changes from the acute to the chronic stage result in DA becoming less informative over time [<xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The pathological changes occurring in microglia may defectively alter neural integrity and affect both DA and RD. Therefore, on later stages of the disease, other biomarkers of inflammation based on PET and MR spectroscopy may become useful in this context.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study is the small sample investigated. Furthermore, being a cross-sectional study, the dynamics of the interaction between retinal changes and WM dysfunction warrants additional investigation in longitudinal studies, from early AD up to more advanced disease stages.</p><p>By only selecting patients with good vision, we may have introduced a conservative bias to the study. By doing so, we aimed at ensuring that cortical changes were not simply a consequence of decreased visual acuity or peripheral visual loss. Although acuity is not critical in the retina periphery, visual contrast sensitivity may still be affected. Since overt visual loss is generally due to retinal causes and we aimed at studying early AD stages, this strategy might have led to a conservative approach, while a more liberal strategy, including patients with overt visual loss might have decreased specificity of findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary Tables</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jad-70-jad190152-s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Strategic project FCT-UID/NEU/04539/2013 – COMPETE, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007440, BIGDATIMAGE, CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-000016, Centro 2020 FEDER, COMPETE, PAC – MEDPERSYST, POCI-01- 0145-FEDER-016428, Neuroscience Mantero Belard Prize 2015 (Santa Casa da Misericórdia): Ref: MB-1049-2015.

The pathogenic pathways leading to vascular cognitive impairment remain unclear but clinical and experimental data have shown that chronic reactive astrogliosis occurs within white matter lesions, indicating that a sustained pro-inflammatory environment affecting the white matter may contribute towards disease progression. To model vascular cognitive impairment, we induced prolonged mild cerebral hypoperfusion in mice by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis. This chronic hypoperfusion resulted in reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia within white matter tracts, demyelination and axonal degeneration, consecutive spatial memory deficits, and loss of white matter integrity, as measured by ultra high-field magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. White matter astrogliosis was accompanied by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kB in reactive astrocytes. Using mice expressing a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kB under the control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-IkBα-dn), we found that transgenic inhibition of astroglial NF-kB signaling ameliorated gliosis and axonal loss, maintained white matter structural integrity, and preserved memory function. Collectively, our results imply that pro-inflammatory changes in white matter astrocytes may represent an important detrimental component in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment, and that targeting these pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40478-016-0350-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Astrocytes</kwd><kwd>vascular cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Glia</kwd><kwd>NF-kB</kwd><kwd>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)</kwd><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Network Of Centres Of Excellence In Neurodegeneration (CoEN)</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005224</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPND 643417/DACAPO-AD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Petzold</surname><given-names>Gabor C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterised by impaired cognitive function attributable to cerebrovascular pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In its pure form, VCI is the second most common form of dementia and represents an important co-factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Neuropathologically, VCI is characterised by demyelination and axonal loss within white matter tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which has traditionally been attributed to the direct effects of chronic oxygen deprivation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that chronic neuroinflammation may also play a detrimental role in the initiation and progression of VCI. First, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, which are risk factors for VCI, induce a chronic pro-inflammatory environment, particularly in and around blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Second, increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers have been detected within white matter lesions in animal models and post-mortem studies of VCI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and alterations of blood–brain barrier integrity are a central and perhaps aggravating element of VCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, in patients and animal models of VCI, reactive gliosis of microglia and astrocytes is present within the white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Reactive astrogliosis is a pervasive defence mechanism in response to cerebral injury that may promote neurodegeneration or neuroprotection in a context-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the roles of astrogliosis and the various inflammatory cascades mediated by reactive astrocytes in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and VCI remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we have used an animal model that recapitulates many of the neuropathological and behavioural hallmarks of VCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We demonstrate that reactive astrogliosis induces activation of the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway in astrocytes, and that transgenic inhibition of this pathway confers protection against axonal loss, helps to promote white matter integrity, and preserves cognitive function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by a local animal welfare committee. We used 10–14 week-old male GFAP-IkBα-dn mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and their wildtype age-matched male littermates. Animals were housed in groups (two to five per cage) on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available <italic toggle="yes">ad libitum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chronic hypoperfusion model</title><p>Gold plated stainless steel microcoils (Sawane) were wrapped around both common carotid arteries in isoflurane-anaesthetised mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Informed by earlier studies that revealed either subtle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or very pronounced changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we modified the existing model by using custom-made coils with an internal diameter of 170 μm. Animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane (1.5 % v/v) and maintained on a heating pad (37 °C). The common carotid arteries were exposed through a midline cervical incision, and the microcoils were wrapped around both common carotid arteries. A 30 min interval was allowed between each microcoil insertion. Sham-treated animals underwent identical procedures except that coils were not implanted. Local lidocaine gel and intraperitoneal buprenorphine were applied as analgesics. Mice from each litter were randomised to either microcoil insertion or sham surgery. All experiments and subsequent data analysis were conducted in a blinded manner, with respect to genotype and treatment. Mice were excluded if visual damage to the carotid arteries or bleeding during surgery occurred. In addition, carotid arteries were inspected for patency at the end of experiments, and animals with occluded carotid arteries were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Laser speckle perfusion imaging and PcomA assessment</title><p>Animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane (1.5 % v/v), and the skull was exposed through a midline incision. A cranial window was created and closed by gluing a glass coverslip onto the skull and adhering the skin to the coverslip rim. For imaging, mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane (1 % v/v) and fixed within a stereotaxic frame (Narishige). Brain perfusion was determined through a closed cranial window in anaesthetised mice using PeriCam PSI Laser Speckle Imager and PIMsoft software (Perimed). PcomA development was determined by transcardial perfusion with India ink (Pelikan; 10 % in water containing 10 % gelatine), followed by decapitation and fixation in 4 % paraformaldehype (PFA). PcomA was scored as: 0, absent; 1, hypoplastic; 2, truncal. A single PcomA score was calculated by averaging left and right scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ultra high-field MRI</title><p>MRI of isoflurane-anaesthetised mice was performed on an 11.7 T horizontal small-bore magnet (Biospec 117/16, Bruker) using a two-element transmit/receive proton (<sup>1</sup>H) cryocoil (Bruker Biospin). Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C via an integrated water heating system. Respiratory rate was maintained at 70-80 cycles/min. Anatomical images were acquired using a rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement (RARE) T<sub>2</sub>-weighted (T<sub>2</sub>-w) sequence [echo time (TE) = 0.01 s; repetition time (TR) = 2.5 s; in-plane resolution 45 μm<sup>2</sup>], and a RARE T<sub>1</sub>-weighted (T<sub>1</sub>-w) sequence (TE/TR = 0.01 s/1 s; in-plane resolution 45 μm<sup>2</sup>). White matter integrity was assessed using an EPI DTI sequence (TE/TR 26/4000 ms; <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> value 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; 60 diffusion directions; 5 b0 images; in-plane resolution 100 μm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Coronal sections (20 μm) were obtained from PFA-fixed hemispheres, blocked with 10 % normal goat serum (Vector Labs) and 0.3 % Triton-X100 (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 5 % goat serum and 0.05 % Triton overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000; Z0334, Dako), rat anti-GFAP (1:1000; 13-0300, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500; #019-19741, Wako), mouse anti-SMI312 (1:500, smi-312r, Covance), rabbit anti-p65 (1:100; sc-372, Santa Cruz; or #3033, Cell Signaling). Stainings were visualised using secondary antibodies from goat conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, 596 or 647 (1:1000; Invitrogen; 2 h at room temperature). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:1000; Invitrogen). Omission of primary antibodies served as negative controls. Confocal images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 700; Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cytokine and NF-kB quantification</title><p>Mice were sacrificed, and the corpus callosum was dissected and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenised in PBS containing protease/phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) using a Precellys 24 homogeniser (Peqlab), and lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 0.5 % Na-deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, pH 7.2). Quantitative cytokine determination was performed using an electrochemiluminescence ELISA (Mouse ProInflammatory Ultra-Sensitive Kit, Meso Scale Discovery). Signals were measured on a SECTOR Imager 2400 reader (Meso Scale Discovery). For NF-kB measurements, nuclear extracts were created from whole brain homogenates (Nuclear Extraction Kit, #2900, Millipore), and NF-kB activity in nuclear extracts was determined with a commercial assay (EZ-TFA assay, #70-610, Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech). All measurements were performed in duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Behavioural tests</title><p>Male GFAP-IkBα-dn and wildtype mice have similar phenotypes in behavioural paradigms, including spatial learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All tests were recorded and analysed using Ethovision XT9 (Noldus). The Y maze consisted of three arms (length, 34.5 cm; width, 8 cm; height, 12.5 cm) extruding at equal angles from a central platform. The Y Maze test was modified from previous designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. During the acquisition trial, one arm was closed and mice were placed at the end of an open arm (chosen at random) and allowed to explore the two open arms for 5 min. After 24 h, mice were returned to the maze with all 3 arms open; the start point corresponding to the individual start point of each mouse in the acquisition trial, and allowed to explore for 5 min. Arm preference was quantified as the ratio between the time spent in one arm and the time spent in all arms (preferency index). For open field exploration, mice were placed in the centre of a dimly lit (20–30 lx) arena. The area was virtually divided into a centre and an area ≤5 cm to the walls (surround). General locomotor activity was quantified as total distance moved and velocity. The level of anxiety was estimated by the percentage of time spent in the surround.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Immunohistochemical images were imported into ImageJ 1.50 (W. Rasband, NIH), smoothed and despeckled using a median filter, and converted to an 8-bit grey level image. Following contrast enhancement (0.4 % saturated pixels), images were binarised with a threshold defined as the mean background intensity plus the standard deviation of background intensity multiplied by 3. Astrocyte area coverage and diameter, and micoglial cell count were determined automatically by ImageJ. For astrocyte process length, binarised images were skeletonised and analysed using the Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D) plugin for ImageJ. These semi-automatic quantifications were compared with a subset of data (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3 from each group) that was quantified by manual analysis; no significant difference was detected between the analysis methods (data not shown). GFAP-positive astrocytes were considered positive for p65 when they showed a spherical somatic p65 staining that was smaller than the GFAP-positive cell soma and overlapped with the Hoechst 33258 nuclear counterstain. Mean pixel intensity of SMI312 staining in 8-bit grey level images was taken as a measure of axonal integrity. Demyelination was analysed in LFB-stained sections using a semi-quantitative scoring system (0 = no demyelination; 1 = visible fiber disarrangement; 2 = vacuoles and focal demyelination; 3 = widespread/continuous demyelination). Examples are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. Analysis of the corpus callosum was performed within pre-defined areas (0.75 mm and 2.0 mm from the midline). All measurements were taken in triplicates, and the values averaged. Laser speckle contrast data were down-sampled, exported into Excel (Microsoft), and normalised to perfusion levels before microcoil implantation. Paravision 5.1 (Bruker) was used to generate the parametric images used for white matter analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured. Direction-encoded colour (DEC) maps based on the primary eigenvectors were generated using in-house software. The colour determines the principal direction (X, Y or Z) of the primary eigenvector exhibiting the largest diffusion coefficient from the measured diffusion tensor: red designates medial to lateral orientation, blue represents dorsal to ventral orientation and green exhibits the rostral to caudal orientation. Regions of interest (ROIs) including the corpus callosum, external capsule and internal capsule were manually drawn onto the diffusion tensor images, and verified by comparison with the corresponding T<sub>2</sub>-w image and a stereotaxic mouse brain atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Heatmaps were generated by a) registering the FA images to a reference image within the respective cohort and b) setting landmarks on trace-weighted diffusion images and transferring them onto their respective FA images. Registration was performed using the bUnwarp plugin (version 2.6.3) for ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Comparisons between two groups were conducted using the Mann–Whitney test.

Longitudinal laser speckle imaging demonstrated a reduction in cerebral blood flow by 32 ± 9 % 24 h and 29 ± 8 % 7 days following BCAS induction, respectively, whereas blood flow remained unaltered in sham-treated mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b-c</xref>). Separate cohorts of mice, perfused either 1 week or 6 weeks after BCAS induction, exhibited white matter demyelination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), reactive astrogliosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e-g</xref>), microglial activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>), and delayed degradation of white matter axonal integrity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). Reactive astrogliosis was evident by increased area coverage, cell size and process length, although the latter parameter is also influenced by GFAP redistribution induced by astrogliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the corpus callosum did not differ between the groups, owing to the high fraction of GFAP-positive astrocytes already present in the white matter (148 ± 12/mm<sup>2</sup> and 159 ± 10/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively; <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 6 for each group; <italic toggle="yes">p &gt;</italic> 0.05, Mann–Whitney test).

Under control conditions, inactive NF-kB is localised to the cytoplasm by its interaction with inhibitory IkB proteins such as IkBα. Dissociation from IkB and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kB is initiated by the degradation of IkB through cytokine-induced IkB kinase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Once activated, NF-kB acts as an important regulator of reactive gliosis, inflammation, myelination and neuronal survival in different disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of activated nuclear NF-kB by immunohistochemistry against the active p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-kB. We found that 27.2 ± 7.1 % of all GFAP-positive white matter reactive astrocytes in hypoperfused mice were positive for nuclear (i.e. active) p65 (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 7 mice; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

White matter microglia and neurons were only very rarely positive for nuclear p65 in chronic hypoxic mice (3.4 ± 0.9 % of Iba1-positive microglia and 0.8 ± 0.3 % of NeuN-positive neurons, respectively). Hoechst-positive and GFAP-negative punctuate p65 signals were rare (7.3 ± 2.4 % of all Hoechst-positive p65 signals). These data indicate that the majority of white matter NF-kB activation in our model occurs in astrocytes. To quantify NF-kB activity, we used a chemiluminescent assay measuring the amount of p65 bound to the flanked DNA binding consensus sequence for NF-kB in nuclear extracts from brain homogenates. Consistent with the immunohistochemistry, this assay demonstrated strong NF-kB activation in the brains of mice subjected to BCAS compared with sham (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated whether the preservation of axonal integrity observed in GFAP-IkBα-dn mice was detectable by DTI MRI. DTI was performed on hypoperfused or sham-treated wildtype and GFAP-IkBα-dn mice 6 weeks post surgery. Coronal images from brain areas encompassing the major white matter tracts (corpus callosum, internal capsule and external capsule) were acquired, and fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured. Representative direction-encoded colour (DEC) maps are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>.

Importantly, clinical and experimental studies have shown that vascular impairment is associated with inflammatory changes and reactive gliosis of the white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], indicating that white matter damage is not simply a consequence of chronic oxygen deprivation but is induced and sustained by a pro-inflammatory environment. The hallmarks of chronic inflammation:reactive gliosis of white matter astrocytes and microglia, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, were also detected in our model and associated with axonal degeneration, demyelination, spatial memory impairment and loss of white matter integrity. Importantly, the DTI signatures of hypoperfused mice corroborated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed on histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and were comparable to those observed in clinical vascular cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The cellular sources of IL-1 and IL-6 are difficult to define <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> using our model. However, earlier studies have shown that microglia and, to a lesser degree, astrocytes release these cytokines during hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Interestingly, we found that astrogliosis induces activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-kB pathway, and that transgenic inhibition of NF-kB signaling in reactive astrocytes confers protection from neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Notably, some degree of gliosis was evident in transgenic mice after BCAS, indicating that multiple pathways may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The protective effect of NF-kB on white matter integrity was also detectable using DTI, underlining the significance of DTI as a longitudinal marker of treatment response in future translational studies.</p><p>It should be noted that the model used in the present study, and arguably in previously published animal studies thus far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], does not reflect certain aspects of clinical vascular cognitive impairment including the chronic evolution of the disease over decades, the predominant affection of small vessels, and cardiovascular and environmental co-morbidities. Therefore, an important question for future studies is whether the protective effect of NF-kB inhibition is evident in models that recapitulate other aspects of human vascular cognitive impairment. One other important point to address will be whether astroglial NF-kB contributes to pathways such as those mediated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 activation or perturbed glutamate uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in models of vascular cognitive impairment.

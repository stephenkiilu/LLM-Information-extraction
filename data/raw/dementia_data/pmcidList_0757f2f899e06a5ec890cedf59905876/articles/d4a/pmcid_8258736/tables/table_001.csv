Inagaki et al.USA [???],31 healthy adults,24.3 (7.6),48%,UCLA-LS (20 item): 44.2 (8.7),"Displaying images of either close relationships or gender-, race-, and age-matched strangers",Lonely individuals (≥1 SD above mean on UCLA-LS) had greater VS activity in response to images of close others vs. strangers; no such difference observed in non-lonely individuals (>1 SD below mean on UCLA-LS).,—Hypothesis-driven ROI analysis—Task may have limited external validity for seeing others everyday social interactions.

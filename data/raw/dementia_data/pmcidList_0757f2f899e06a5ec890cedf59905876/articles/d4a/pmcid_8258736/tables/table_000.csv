Kong et al.China [???],308 healthy adults,19.9 (1.3; 18–27),54%,UCLA-LS (20 item): 41.70 (7.9),"Loneliness was positively associated with rGMV of left dlPFC. This relationship was partially mediated by neuroticism and extraversion.Covariates: age, gender, and total gray matter volume",—Limited covariates—Exploratory whole brain analysis

Only included loneliness as a covariate in their primary analysis of “social distress” and brain volumes

Düzel et al.Germany [???],319 healthy older adults; Berlin Aging Study,70.1 (3.7; 61–82),38%,UCLA-LS (7 item): 1.6 (0.6),"Loneliness was associated with smaller GMV in the left amygdala/anterior hippocampus, left posterior parahippocampus, and left cerebellum.Significant loneliness by age interactions were found for dlPFC, amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex. Loneliness by depression interaction were revealed in dlPFC and insula.Covariates: age, gender, education, social network, size, depressive affect, openness, morbidity, total intracranial volume, time interval between MRI and cognitive/psychosocial assessment",—Exploratory whole brain analysis and hypothesis-driven ROI analysis—ROI were selected based on prior studies exploring brain regions

We aim to explore the impact of white matter (WM) damage on gait disorders in SIVD. 21 SIVD patients and 20 normal controls (NC) were included in the study. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate general cognition, while Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off (SAT) was used to assess executive function. Gait velocity, cadence, and stride length were measured. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data were analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and Peak Width of Skeletonized Mean Diffusivity (PSMD). The relationships among WM damage, gait disorders, and cognitive function were examined through mediation analysis. SIVD scored lower than NC in MoCA and SAT tests (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Gait velocity and stride length were decreased in SIVD. SIVD had lower PSMD (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). PSMD correlated with gait parameters, which were totally mediated by MoCA and partially mediated by SAT. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC) and body of CC (BCC) were correlated with gait parameters. The FA of the bilateral anterior corona radiata (ACR) was positively correlated with gait parameters, while the MD of the bilateral superior corona radiata (SCR), bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left external capsule (EC) were negatively correlated with them (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Gait impairments in SIVD were associated with cognitive deficits. Cognitive impairment mediated the WM damage and gait disorders. The microstructural alterations of CC, SLF, EC, and CR may be related to changes in gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Subcortical ischemic vascular disease</kwd><kwd>Tract-based spatial statistics</kwd><kwd>Gait disorders</kwd><kwd>White matter damages</kwd><kwd>Mediation analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>81971573</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022944</institution-id><institution>Suzhou Gusu Medical Youth Talent</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GSWS2020019</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) caused by small vessel disease is the second leading cause of dementia. Gait disturbance is a common symptom in SIVD patients, along with executive dysfunction, memory deficits, and psychomotor slowness(Fu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Gait disorders are highly prevalent in the elderly and are associated with serious consequences such as an increased risk of falls, fractures, and mortality (Mirelman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>; Studenski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Various factors contribute to gait impairments including age, SIVD, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Cicirelli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>; Pinter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">There is a strong correlation between cognition and walking in older adults (CohenVerghese &amp; Zwerling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>). Walking is a highly complex activity that requires coordination of the nervous system with the musculoskeletal system, as well as integration of visual and other sensory feedback. Executive function, a cognitive domain, has been found to be closely associated with walking (Cohen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>). Studies have shown that executive dysfunction is linked to declines in gait speed, and improvements in executive function are parallel to increases in gait speed (BestDavis &amp; Liu-Ambrose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Martin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). Gait disorders have been found to be correlated with executive dysfunction in patients with SIVD, AD, PD, multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke (Coghe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>; Kim &amp; Fraser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>; Moustafa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>). Additionally, some researchers have suggested that gait disorders in SIVD patients are mediated by executive dysfunction (Cai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>). White matter (WM) damage has been clearly linked to executive deficits in SIVD patients. However, the impact of WM damage on gait disorders in SIVD patients remains unclear.</p><p id="Par8">SIVD is characterized by the presence of lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Sun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>). However, De Laat et al. found that these conventional SIVD markers do not fully explain the symptoms of gait deficits, suggesting that there may be other underlying mechanisms contributing to gait disturbances (de Laat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). White matter lesions are commonly observed in SIVD patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique used to assess white matter integrity in vivo in a sensitive and noninvasive manner (Zeestraten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is an objective method for analyzing diffusion data at the voxel level, providing comprehensive insights into white matter damage in an automated way (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>). TBSS is capable of analyzing the extent of WM damage throughout the entire brain. The key steps of TBSS involve computing fractional anisotropy (FA) images for each subject, registering these images to a standard space, creating an average FA skeleton, projecting each subject’s FA images onto the skeleton, and comparing their FA images on the skeleton (KarimiKebiri &amp; Gholipour, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2023</xref>). Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) serves as a novel, fully automated, and reliable imaging marker (Vinciguerra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>). In Baykara et al.’s study, PSMD was introduced to quantify the overall burden of white matter injury in the brain by combining white matter skeleton and histogram analysis (Baykara et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). PSMD shows promise in clinical applications due to its objectivity and ease of implementation.</p><p id="Par9">The common feature of TBSS and PSMD is their assessment of whole-brain WM damage rather than specific regions. However, there are differences between the two methods. Firstly, PSMD evaluates overall WM damage in the entire brain, while TBSS divides the WM into multiple tracts for group comparison. Secondly, PSMD only utilizes DTI-derived mean diffusivity (MD) as a marker, whereas TBSS includes metrics such as FA, MD, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Lastly, statistical analysis of TBSS metrics between groups is conducted using non-parametric permutation analysis in this study, while PSMD employs Mann–Whitney U-test for analysis.</p><p id="Par10">The presence of white matter damage is a characteristic of patients with SIVD. Symptoms in these patients include cognitive impairment and gait disorder. Previous research has shown that cognitive impairment is linked to gait disorder, and that white matter damage contributes to cognitive impairment in SIVD patients. However, the relationship between gait disorder, white matter damage, and cognitive impairment remains unclear. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the impact of white matter damage on gait disorders and their interrelation in SIVD patients. We hypothesized that cognitive dysfunction mediates the relationship between white matter damage and gait disorders. Line regression-based mediation analysis was used to examine the relationship among microstructural alterations of white matter, gait disorders, and cognitive deficits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par11">A total of 41 right-handed Chinese Han subjects (21 SIVD patients and 20 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in this study at the Department of Radiology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2020 to January 2022. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation. All subjects underwent a cognitive test and 3.0-T whole brain MRI scanning. Beijing version of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was utilized for general cognition assessment (Lu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). Executive function was evaluated using the Color-Word Stroop Test, with reaction time in recognizing word color (Stroop test 1) and accuracy (Stroop test 2) serving as judgment criteria. Subsequently, Speed-Accuracy Trade-off (SAT) scores were calculated as [accuracy (%)/reaction time] (van Uden et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">SIVD patients met the following criteria(Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>; Roman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2002</xref>):(1) WM lesions: WM flair hyperintensities extending into periventricular and deep white matter; (2) lacunas: multiple lacunas (&gt; 5) in the deep gray matter with at least moderate WM lesions in T2 flair; (3) the score of MoCA &lt; 26.</p><p id="Par13">NC group met the following criteria: (1) The score of MoCA ≥ 26 and no cognitive complaints; (2) there are no WM flair hyperintensities and lacunas in T2 flair images; (3) no neurological diseases.</p><p id="Par14">The exclusion criteria were as follow: (1) metabolic conditions, such as hypothyroidism or folic acid deficiencies; (2) a history of stroke; (3) central nervous system diseases that could cause cognitive decline, such as PD, epilepsy, MS.

When wearing the sensor, gait information such as cadence, walking speed, and stride length was automatically recorded. Participants were instructed to wear comfortable shoes and walk at their usual pace. Gait velocity, cadence, and stride length for each participant were recorded by calculating the mean value from both right and left feet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Image Acquisition and Data processing</title><p id="Par16">All MRI examinations were conducted using a 3.0 T MRI machine (GE Signa HDxt 3.0T) equipped with an eight-channel head coil. Sagittal T1-weighted MR sequence was performed using a three-dimensional turbo fast echo acquisition, with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 6.52 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.80 ms, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, flip angle = 8°, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, number of slices = 192, and slice thickness = 1 mm. DTI data were obtained using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: in32 non-collinear directions diffusion encoding(b = 1,000 s/mm2 for each direction), and one image with no diffusion weighting(b = 0 s/mm2), TR = 9,154ms, TE = 55ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 112 × 112, FOV = 224 × 224 mm, and slice thickness = 2.5 mm. The total scan duration was13 min. Additionally axial T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence, and FLAIR sequence were acquired to detect acute or subacute infarctions and visible WM damage.</p><p id="Par17">The DTI data was processed using Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL) version 5.0.9 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>). Firstly, realignment and eddy current correction were performed by affine-aligning the diffusion-weighted volumes and correcting for eddy-current distortions using FMRIB’s nonlinear image registration tool. Subsequently, brain extraction was carried out with a fractional threshold of 0.2 to remove non-brain tissue. Finally, DTIfit within FSL was utilized to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) for diffusion tensor index calculation.</p><p id="Par18">The TBSS process was conducted using FSL, following these steps (Aggio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>; KoyamaUchiyama &amp; Domen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>): (1) Normalizing each participant’s FA images to the standard FMRIB58 FA template using the nonlinear registration algorithm in FSL. (2) Creating the mean FA map and FA skeleton by averaging the mean FA map. (3) Generating the mean FA skeleton with a FA threshold of 0.2 to exclude voxels primarily containing gray matter or cerebrospinal fluid. (4) Projecting every participant’s FA onto the FA skeleton. (5) Analyzing differences in FA values between NC and SIVD patients using non-parametric permutation method in FSL (FSL randomize procedure). The MD images were processed with similar procedures as for the FA images.</p><p id="Par19">The process of PSMD involved the skeletonization of DTI data and histogram analysis (Baykara et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). Firstly, the skeletonization of DTI data was carried out using the TBSS process as described above. Second, PSMD was calculated as the different value of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the voxel-based MD values within the skeleton.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par20">All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Product and Service Software (SPSS ver. 20.0, Chicago, IL). The normality of distribution of continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Intergroup differences in age, years of education, MoCA score, and SAT score were evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Gender differences between groups were analyzed using the Pearson Test. Differences in velocity, cadence, stride length of gait and PSMD between SIVD patients and NC were examined with the Mann–Whitney U‐test. The disparities in FA and MD values between SIVD and NC were analyzed through non-parametric permutation analysis (randomize) tool in FSL while including age, gender and years of education as covariates.</p><p id="Par21">Mediation analysis was conducted using the Process macro in SPSS version 20, with a confidence level of 95 and 5000 bootstrap samples. The independent variable (X) was PSMD, while the dependent variable (Y) was gait indexes. Model 4 in the Process macro was used to analyze the total, direct, and indirect effects of PSMD on gait indexes, with MoCA and SAT scores as mediators (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>). Mediators can fully or partially mediate the relationship between X and Y. We hypothesize that X has a significant total effect on Y. Mediation analysis decomposes the total effect into direct and indirect effects through mediator variables (Rijnhart et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>). If adding the mediator results in no significant direct effect between X and Y, but a significant indirect effect through the mediator, then the mediator fully mediates the relationship between X and Y. On the other hand, if adding the mediator results in not only a significant direct effect of X on Y, but also a significant indirect effect through the mediator, then the mediator partially mediates the relationship between X and Y. Mediation analysis is generally used to investigate the pathway through which X influences Y (Carter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). The relationships between gait indexes and the FA, MD values of white matter tracts, as well as cognitive function, were examined using Pearson correlation analysis. A p value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par22">In Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, it was observed that there were no significant differences in age and gender between SIVD patients and NC (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.80, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.56).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">Previous research has shown that executive dysfunction is a characteristic manifestation in SIVD patients (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>). Our findings also indicate that SIVD patients exhibit impaired global cognition and executive function compared to NC. Takakusaki et al. suggested that walking involves not only mechanical action but also cognitive processes (Takakusaki, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). Furthermore, it is proposed that gait velocity is correlated with global cognition and executive function, which aligns with our study. Bethoux et al. pointed out that walking requires continuous cognitive control, and impaired cognition can lead to disrupted gait performance (Bethoux, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). We also observed associations between gait velocity, stride length, global cognition, and executive function in SIVD patients, confirming the notion that walking is a cognitive process requiring “high-level” cognitive control.</p><p id="Par37">The PSMD value showed a significant correlation with gait velocity and stride length in the current study. It is well known that WM lesions are associated with cognitive dysfunction in SIVD patients (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). There were significant correlations among WM lesions, gait parameters, and cognitive deficits. Mediation analysis was used to further analyze the relationships among them. We found that WM damages correlated with gait velocity and stride length were totally mediated by global cognition and partially mediated by executive function. Therefore, we suggest that the relationship between WM damages and gait speed is driven by cognition deficit in SIVD patients. These results also confirm that gait is not simply a mechanical activity but rather a cognitive process, where cognition plays a vital role in gait disorders (Cai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">FA and MD are measures of diffusion directionality and overall magnitude of water diffusion, respectively (Pierpaoli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1996</xref>). Decreased FA and increased MD can indicate impaired integrity of white matter tracts (Zhou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>). In the present study, SIVD patients showed decreased FA and increased MD values in the CC (including the GCC, BCC, and SCC), indicating injury to the integrity of the CC (Soares et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). Previous studies have also reported significant impairment of the SLF in SIVD patients consistent with our findings (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>; de Laat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>; Tuladhar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Our study also revealed damage to the EC and CR in SIVD patients. However, we did not find any previous studies mentioning injury to these regions in SIVD patients.</p><p id="Par39">The CC is the largest commissural white matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres, and it is involved in attention and executive function (Reginold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>). CC transmits information between hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric cooperation. Impairment of the CC can lead to disconnection syndrome, including sensory-motor disconnection and cognitive impairments. The CC can be divided into rostrum, genu, body, isthmus, and splenium (Nilles et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2022</xref>). The body of the CC contains fibers related to motor and somatosensory cortices while the splenium comprises fibers to temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices (Matsukawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the splenium is important for integrating visual and spatial information (Moscufo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>), which is crucial for gait. Damage to white matter in the splenium could result in gait impairment due to its role in visuospatial processing. The body of the CC plays a key role in bilateral motor coordination and translating visual-motor tasks (Matsukawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). The genu includes fibers connecting bilateral prefrontal cortices (Witelson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1989</xref>), which are closely associated with executive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that executive dysfunction mediated by damage to the genu could lead to gait disorders. Additionally, our study found that fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values of both the genu and body of the CC were positively correlated with gait velocity while negatively correlated with stride length respectively. This suggests that there may be a relationship between white matter damage and gait disorders mediated by cognitive dysfunction.</p><p id="Par40">The integrity of the SLF, EC and CR was also compromised, showing significant correlation with gait indexes. The SLF connects the parietal and frontal lobes of the brain, originating from the parietal lobe to the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and middle frontal gyrus (SchurrZelman &amp; Mezer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). It is involved in motor planning, visuospatial attention, and complex motor behavior (Vergani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021</xref>). Previous studies have reported that most fibers of the SLF overlay with the superior part of EC and that the lateral cholinergic tract crosses through EC (KlinkenbergSambeth &amp; Blokland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Nolze-Charron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). The cholinergic pathways play an important role in cognition and attention. Impaired EC has been correlated with executive and information-processing deficits (Head et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>). The CR includes projection fibers connecting the brain stem with frontal cortex and motor cortices such as corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine fibers (Hu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2022</xref>). The integrity of CR is closely correlated with executive function. Therefore, evidence suggests that damage to CCs SLF, ECs or CR may lead to cognitive deficits impacting gait disorders.</p><p id="Par41">The present study had several limitations. Firstly, the sample size of SIVD patients and the NC group was small and should be expanded in future research to increase the confidence of conclusions. Additionally, many SIVD patients were excluded due to unqualified DTI images caused by intolerable scan times. Secondly, the SIVD patients were not categorized based on severity of cognitive impairment, which warrants further investigation into the mediation effects between WM damages and gait disorders. Thirdly, as a cross-sectional study, it was unable to establish causal relationships between WM lesions and gait impairments; therefore, longitudinal studies are necessary for future research. Fourthly, significant differences in education levels between SIVD and NC groups could not be further analyzed due to the small sample size. When compared the differences of FA and MD between SIVD and NC, we included education as covariates in order to reduce the impact generated by different education years. When comparing the differences in FA and MD between SIVD and NC, we included education as a covariate to mitigate the impact of varying years of education. However, further research is needed to examine the effect of education on cognition and gait. Additionally, our study focused on elderly participants, whose brains may exhibit varying degrees of atrophy. While previous studies have indicated a correlation between cortical thickness and gait performance, our current study specifically targeted white matter tract injury, with plans for future investigation into grey matter atrophy.

WM injury, as assessed by PSMD, was correlated with gait velocity and stride length, a relationship that was fully mediated by global cognition and partially mediated by executive function. The microstructural changes in the CC, SLF, EC, and CR may contribute to alterations in gait velocity and stride length.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher’s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Mengmeng Feng and Ziyang Song contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>There are no people provided contributions to this research besides the authors.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Author contributions included conception and study design (Hui Dai and Mengmeng Feng), data collection or acquisition (Mengmeng Feng, Zhiwei Wu and Ziyang Song), statistical analysis (Mengmeng Feng and Yuanqing Liu), interpretation of results (Mengmeng Feng, Mengya Ma, Yueju Wang and Zheping Zhou), drafting the manuscript work (Mengmeng Feng) and approval of final version to be published and agreement to be accountable for the integrity and accuracy of all aspects of the work (All authors).</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 81971573) and the Suzhou Gusu Medical Youth Talent (grant number GSWS2020019).</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the finding of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar4"><title>Ethics approval</title><p id="Par46">The study was approved by the ethics committees of the first affiliated hospital of Soochow University.</p></notes><notes id="FPar5"><title>Informed consent</title><p id="Par47">The written informed consent was obtained from each subject in the study.</p></notes><notes id="FPar1"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par43">All authors agree this journal to publish our article.</p></notes><notes id="FPar2" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par44">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Aggio</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Fabbella</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Finardi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Mazza</surname><given-names>EB</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Colombo</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Falini</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Neurofilaments light: Possible biomarker of brain modifications in bipolar disorder</article-title><source>Journal of Affective Disorders</source><year>2022</year><volume>300</volume><fpage>243</fpage><lpage>248</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.122</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">34979181</pub-id></element-citation><mixed-citation id="mc-CR1" publication-type="journal">Aggio, V., Fabbella, L., Finardi, A., Mazza, E.

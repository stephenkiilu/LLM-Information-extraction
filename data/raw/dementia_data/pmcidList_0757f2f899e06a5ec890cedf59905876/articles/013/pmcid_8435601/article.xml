The American Academy of Neurology has recently recommended an annual cognitive health assessment for patients 65 years and older (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The rationale behind this recommendation asserts that brain diseases may be delayed or prevented if detected at early stages and that certain risks associated with compromised brain health are modifiable (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The lack of effective evaluation tools for brain health leaves most clinical assessments to be based on the patient's clinical history and simple cognitive screening, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has therefore recommended routine assessment of cognitive health in high-risk patients. To date, cognitive assessment has been shown to be the most efficient, clinically usable, and cost-effective tool. Nonetheless, it is well established that objective cognitive manifestations of neurodegeneration are observed only in relatively late stages of disease progression and therefore may not provide the desired preventive effect (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In contrast, specific physiological changes in brain network connectivity and plasticity are known to occur at the early stages of the disease and therefore it is estimated that a large proportion of cerebrovascular diseases and dementias may be prevented or at least delayed if detected during early pathophysiology stages (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In 2014, the term subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was conceived by researchers to describe the subjective experience of worsening cognitive performance among cognitively normal older individuals. SCD has been shown to indicate an <italic toggle="yes">at-risk</italic> stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several studies, using a variety of assessments, found SCD to predict objective cognitive impairment incidents of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and AD dementia. Furthermore, in several cross-sectional studies, cognitive complaints were found to correlate with biomarkers of AD pathology such as amyloid-ß (Aß) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A meta-analysis of longitudinal epidemiological studies of cognitively unimpaired individuals with SCD (with at least 4 years of follow-up data) demonstrated that people with SCD are at increased risk of developing future MCI and that overall the risk of developing dementia is double in individuals having SCD (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Neuroimaging studies have shown that AD-related changes, including hippocampal volume loss and white matter hyperintensities, already occur in older adults with SCD before objective cognitive impairment becomes evident (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), supporting the notion that SCD may provide an indicator of the preclinical phase of AD.</p><p>Cognitive complaints may be caused by over 50 known factors such as depression, anxiety, personality factors, and quality of life (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Improving the characterization of at-risk states and detection of early disease stages are crucial for targeted and effective dementia prevention (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). An ideal method for detecting preclinical, physiological changes reflecting early stages of degeneration would be a patient independent, objective, easily performed, and interpreted method. The current study seeks to illustrate potential early and objective neurophysiological biomarkers of neurodegenerative cognitive decline, by evaluating brain network physiological performance and structure of SCD subjects, aMCI and dementia patients as well as healthy age-related controls, utilizing multiple evaluation paradigms including computerized cognitive performance testing, gray matter (GM) volume, white matter (WM) integrity (Fractional anisotropy and Mean Diffusivity), and brain network function using DELPHI (TMS-EEG) measures of connectivity and plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Clinical Data Collection and Analysis</title><p>The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendation of the ‘Shamir’ Medical center review board. The protocol was approved by the local institutional “Ethical Committee” as a retrospective study of data.

The study population included subjects who attended the “Sagol” center for hyperbaric medicine for participating in a study evaluating the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on cognitive performance and health.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>The study included 15 healthy, 17 SCD, 12 amnestic MCI (aMCI), and 11 Dementia (most probably Alzheimer's disease) subjects. Inclusion criteria for the Healthy Control (HC) subjects group were as follows: (1) age over 50; (2) no neurological or psychiatric disorder is documented in medical history or self-report; (3) absence of any significant abnormal findings in MRI scan such as brain tumors, subdural hematoma, and other brain-structural lesions related to diagnosed brain disease other than common age-related changes; (4) no psychoactive or other brain-directed medications; (5) no reported Self-experienced persistent decline in cognitive capacity reported during neuropsychologist interview; (6) normal age-, gender-, and education-adjusted performance on standardized cognitive tests. The inclusion criteria for the SCD group are as follows: (1–4) as described in 1–4 for the HC group; (5) subjects that experience a persistent decline in cognitive capacity in comparison with a previously normal status, unrelated to an acute event reported during neuropsychologist interview (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and were actively seeking medical assistance for their subjective cognitive impairment report; (6) normal age-, gender-, and education-adjusted performance on standardized cognitive tests. The aMCI group was based on Petersen criteria (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which include memory complaint together with preserved everyday activities, a memory impairment based on a standard neuropsychological test, preserved global cognitive functions, and finally the exclusion of dementia. aMCI inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) age over 50; (2) clinical diagnosis of aMCI by a physician; (3) a Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA score 19–25; (4) a computerized testing index score of at least 1.5 standard deviations (STDV) below the age-related norm in verbal and non-verbal memory score only; (5) a normal global standardized cognitive score of Attention/Information Processing/Executive Function; (6) the absence of other unrelated neurological or psychiatric disorders documented in medical history or self-report; (7) the absence of any unrelated significant abnormal findings in MRI scan such as brain tumors, subdural hematoma, and other structural brain lesions. The inclusion criteria for the Dementia group were as follows: (1) age over 50.; (2) a clinical diagnosis of dementia (most probably AD) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); (3) a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score under 19 as evaluated by neuropsychologist (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>); (4) no other major neurological disease; (5) a computerized testing index score of at least 1.5 standard deviations (STDV) below the age-related norm in verbal and non-verbal memory score and at least in one out of three additional computerized tests (Attention/Information Processing/Executive Function); (6) the absence of other unrelated neurological or psychiatric disorder documented in medical history or self-report; (7) the absence of any unrelated significant abnormal findings in MRI scans, such as brain tumors, subdural hematoma, and other structural brain lesions.

NeuroTrax tests evaluate various aspects of brain functions and include Verbal Memory (immediate and delayed recognition), Non-Verbal Memory (immediate and delayed recognition), Go-No-Go Response Inhibition, Problem Solving, Stroop Interference, Catch Game, and Staged Information Processing Speed (single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit arithmetic). Cognitive index scores were computed from the normalized outcome parameters for memory, executive function (EF), attention, and information processing speed (IPS), (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). After administration, the NeuroTrax data were uploaded to the NeuroTrax central server, and outcome parameters were automatically calculated using software blind to the diagnosis or testing site. To account for the well-known effects of age and education on cognitive performance, each outcome parameter was normalized and fit to an IQ-like scale (mean = 100, S.D. = 15) according to the patient's age and education. The normative data used by NeuroTrax consist of test data from cognitively healthy individuals in controlled research studies at more than 10 sites (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging and Analysis</title><p>All subjects underwent MRI scans of the brain and DELPHI (TMS-EEG) evaluations not more than 2 weeks apart. Imaging was performed with a 3 Tesla system (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 20-channel receiver head coil. A weighted T1 analysis was performed with the SPM12 software package (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>), and 30 diffusion-weighted images were scanned with different gradient directions (b = 1,000), one volume without diffusion weighting, using the following parameters: TR = 10,300 ms, TE = 89 ms, Voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 mm, Matrix = 128 × 128, No. of slices = 63, and Slice thickness = 2.2 mm. Diffuse Tensor Imaging (DTI) analysis was performed on the fractional Anisotrophy (FA) and ADC maps calculated by Siemens post-processing software. For each subject, the WM atlas [ICBM-MORI white matter atlas (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)] was registered to the DTI map using SPM (version 12, The Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, UK) and manually validated to avoid registration errors. Mean values for FA higher than 0.2 were calculated in WM regions according to the atlas (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>TMS-EEG</title><p>TMS was performed with a MagPro R30 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark) and an MCF-B65-HO figure-8 Coil (MagVenture, Denmark). The 32-channel EEG data were obtained using TMS compatible BrainAmp DC amplifier (5 kHz sampling rate; ±16.384 mv measurement range; analog low pass filter 1 kHz; Brain Products GmbH, Germany). These were connected to the waveguard™ EEG cap (ANT Neuro, Netherland) with Ag-AgCl electrodes. Electrode impedances were kept below 5 kOhm. The reference and ground electrodes were affixed to the ear lobes. EEG data were recorded using a BrainVision Recorder software (Brain Products GmbH, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Procedure</title><p>All TMS stimulations were performed over the left motor cortex (M1). Stimulation protocol, acquisition, and data processing using our fully automated DELPHI algorithm were all performed as described previously by Zifman and Levy-Lamdan et al.

TMS coil was positioned over the left cortical motor (M1) region at 45° toward the contralateral forehead according to guidelines (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Single-pulse (no history dependent; &lt;0.3Hz frequency) and 1 Hz (inhibitory frequency) stimulation were performed at 80% from rest motor threshold (RMT) intensity. Data acquisition, pre-processing, and cleaning of the TMS evoked response include rejection of bad channels and epochs containing large artifacts followed by bandpass FIR filter (0.5–45 Hz) as detailed in Zifman and Levy-Lamdan et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A thin (0.5 mm) Foam pad was attached to the TMS coil to minimize electrode movement and bone-conducted auditory artifact. Participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed throughout the examination to reduce ocular artifacts. The operator of the system conversed with subjects between the short stimulation protocol blocks in order to avoid drowsiness. Electrodes data were grouped to regional recording hotspots for analysis and statistical purposes: Frontal (F3, F5-ipsilateral and F4, and F6-contralateral to stimulation.); Parietal (C3, C5, CP1-ipsilateral, and C4, C6, and CP2-contralateral to stimulation); Temporal (CP5, CP3, CF5-ipsilateral, and CP6, CP4, and FC6-contralateral to stimulation); Occipital cortex (O1, PO3-ipsilateral, and O2 PO4-contralateral to stimulation).</p><p>All data processing, analyses, and statistics were made using MATLAB (R2020a, The Mathworks Inc., MA, United States).</p></sec><sec><title>DELPHI Physiological Network Profile Analysis Parameters</title><p>DELPHI analyzed the regional and network TMS-Evoked Potential (TEP) EEG pattern of single and history-dependent events as described in (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). All output measures were calculated as described previously. Waveform Adherence (WFA) refers to single pulse response (20–300 msec after stimulation) adherence to mean healthy age-related signals collected from previous studies. Network Short Term Plasticity is referred to as STP. The normalized difference ratio between the mean field potential of the single pulse response (MFP<sub>single</sub>) and the mean field potential of the inhibitory frequency of stimulation (MFP<sub>i</sub>), indicating network short term plasticity (STP), is calculated as (MFP<sub>single</sub>−MFP<sub>i)</sub>/(MFP<sub>single</sub>+MFP<sub>i</sub>).

Study results indicate that although no pathological cognitive changes were detected in the SCD population compared to healthy norms, brain network functional and structural connectivity measured by DELPHI (TMS-EEG) and DTI in SCD subjects were significantly changed. In contrast, SCD subjects did not display any significant decrease in GM volume of specific ROIs related to cognitive neurodegeneration. A significant decrease in GM volume was evident only in aMCI and dementia groups compared to HC and SCD. This data supports the concept that changes in brain network function and microstructure connectivity precede manifestation in gray matter and objectively measured cognitive performance. Previous studies have also displayed such neurophysiological and microstructural disruptions prior to structural atrophy in individuals with SCD in parietal, frontal and hippocampal areas (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Interestingly, both WM and EEG-TMS measures of brain function display no significant differences between SCD and aMCI. These results may be caused by the limited number of subjects in the aMCI group or by the fact that the SCD group included subjects that were actively seeking treatment for their subjective cognitive decline and maybe at more progressive stages than other SCD subjects. In this study, no significant changes were found in WM, GM, and neurophysiological measures between aMCI and dementia groups. These results are supported by Kiuchi et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) but are not consistent with other studies that display WM changes between aMCI and dementia patients (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and may be caused by the ROI-based analysis and small sample size of both the aMCI and dementia groups. These results may indicate that although the cognitive decline between aMCI and dementia is evident, the majority of neurophysiological and brain tissue damage has occurred before cognitive performance is compromised and may be objectively diagnosed. The results of this study, together with previous work, help support the understanding that brain network integrity deterioration precedes objective cognitive impairment and might be subjectively experienced by the patient. This concept is indactive of the early clinical manifestation of neurophysiological and microstructural changes as described schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. This scheme [adapted and expanded from Jessen et al. 2014 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)] displays objective cognitive performance deterioration during dementia progression compared to physiological clinical measures as presented in this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the objective decrease in cognitive performance compared to GM volume decrease which is most prominent in objective cognitive impairment stages of aMCI and dementia vs. WM and neurophysiological measures which have been shown to display significant changes even in subjective cognitive decline subjects and progress in a slower rate in aMCI and Dementia groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This figure illustrates the notion that by the time a disease or a cognitive impairment diagnosis is made most of the neuronal damage reflecting brain network integrity has already occurred. Therefore, the subjective perception of the patient might be sufficient to indicate the need for additional tests of these early neurophysiological biomarkers utilizing advanced technologies such as DELPHI (EEG-TMS) or DTI imaging and potentially prevent further degenerative deterioration.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>An illustrative model describing brain network integrity vs. cognitive decline in relation to progressive degeneration. Objective cognitive impairment is noticeable following the subjective cognitive impairment stage.

These non-degenerative factors should be identified as they are treated and handled differently from neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the current study compares different groups of subjects; healthy, SCD as well as aMCI and dementia representing subjects at different stages of cognitive impairment related to neurodegeneration. As this study is not a longitudinal study, in order to support its clinical findings and relevance, further longitudinal follow-up studies utilizing these clinical tools with controlled mood, cognitive, and other risk factors evaluations are required. In addition, the small sample size for each subject group in this study requires further validation in larger study groups. Nonetheless, the data presented in this study provides evidence supporting previous studies displaying noticeable physiological changes in brain network connectivity and function in earlier stages than detected nowadays using currently available standard of care tools as cognitive assessment and imaging tools (MR or CT) for structural brain imaging (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Detection of at-risk states and early disease stages are crucial for targeted and effective neurodegenerative dementia prevention. The data presented in this study suggest potential early detection biomarkers of changes in brain network integrity (connectivity and functionality) utilizing DTI or DELPHI (TMS-EEG) modalities. These data support our previous study that demonstrated the high correlation of DELPHI neurophysiological measures to WM integrity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and supports physiological evidence which singles out the SCD population as being at high risk for developing MCI and dementia. These tools and biomarkers may indicate early physiological changes in such at-risk and early disease stages, thus provide clinically available early-stage biomarkers of neurodegenerative related changes in subjects that have not yet displayed any other objective measurable cognitive deficits or GM volume decrease and facilitate the prevention of further neurodegenerative deterioration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Shamir Medical center Ethical Committee review board.

A number of disease features can be assessed on MRI including lacunar infarcts, T2 lesion volume, brain atrophy, and cerebral microbleeds. In addition, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to disruption of white matter ultrastructure, and recently it has been suggested that additional information on the pattern of damage may be obtained from axial diffusivity, a proposed marker of axonal damage, and radial diffusivity, an indicator of demyelination. We determined the contribution of these whole brain MRI markers to cognitive impairment in SVD. Consecutive patients with lacunar stroke and confluent leukoaraiosis were recruited into the ongoing SCANS study of cognitive impairment in SVD (n = 115), and underwent neuropsychological assessment and multimodal MRI. SVD subjects displayed poor performance on tests of executive function and processing speed. In the SVD group brain volume was lower, white matter hyperintensity volume higher and all diffusion characteristics differed significantly from control subjects (n = 50). On multi-predictor analysis independent predictors of executive function in SVD were lacunar infarct count and diffusivity of normal appearing white matter on DTI. Independent predictors of processing speed were lacunar infarct count and brain atrophy. Radial diffusivity was a stronger DTI predictor than axial diffusivity, suggesting ischaemic demyelination, seen neuropathologically in SVD, may be an important predictor of cognitive impairment in SVD. Our study provides information on the mechanism of cognitive impairment in SVD.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Wellcome Trust (grant number 081589).

Radiological correlates are lacunar infarcts, with or without more diffuse areas of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), also referred to as leukoaraiosis. Other features are brain atrophy and cerebral microbleeds. Cognitive impairment in SVD is characterised by prominent impairment of executive function and processing speed, with relative preservation of episodic memory <xref rid="pone.0061014-Pantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite its importance, there are few specific treatments for cognitive impairment in SVD. The development of evidence based treatment approaches depends upon better understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive decline.</p><p>A number of potential mechanisms have been suggested, and their role investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A popular hypothesis is that white matter damage causes white matter tract disruption and disconnection of cortical-subcortical and cortical-cortical connections underlying complex networks associated with cognitive control mechanisms and efficient information processing <xref rid="pone.0061014-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A number of pathologies seen in SVD could potentially cause such disruption including discrete lacunar infarcts, more diffuse regions of leukoaraiosis, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB).</p><p>MRI can be used to investigate the role of these different pathologies in causing cognitive impairment. In patients with SVD correlations between T2 lesion volume and cognition are weak <xref rid="pone.0061014-Junqu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Sachdev1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This may reflect the fact that high signal on T2-weighted images represents increased water content and may not differentiate between areas of mildly and severely damaged tissue <xref rid="pone.0061014-Awad1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is more sensitive to white matter ultrastructural damage and DTI parameters have been shown to correlate more strongly with cognition than T2 lesion volume <xref rid="pone.0061014-OSullivan2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Holtmannsptter1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Not only can average diffusivity be measured as a marker of white matter ultrastructure, but the anisotropy of diffusion gives information on its directionality, and thus integrity of white matter structures. It has been recently suggested that additional information obtained from the diffusion tensor can give further insight in the nature of white matter damage. Axial and Radial components of the tensor have been proposed as markers with specificity to the type of neuronal damage <xref rid="pone.0061014-Burzynska1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Axial diffusivity (AD) represents diffusivity in the principal diffusion direction (i.e. in the gross orientation of white matter structure) and is a proposed marker of axonal damage, while radial diffusivity (RD), which is the average of diffusivities perpendicular to the principal direction of the tensor (and hence the gross orientation of white matter structure), is proposed to give information on the degree of demyelination. Such information may be relevant in SVD in which both ischaemic demyelination and axonal loss are seen pathologically <xref rid="pone.0061014-Pantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Another feature associated with cognitive impairment in SVD is brain atrophy <xref rid="pone.0061014-Nitkunan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Nitkunan2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This could occur due to SVD pathology itself, or grey matter atrophy could occur secondary to white matter tract disruption producing denervation of cortical structures. Most studies in SVD have looked at global brain atrophy rather than differentiating grey and white matter volumes to assess whether changes in one particular brain compartment drive this association. CMB, small deposits of blood product detectable using blood sensitive MRI sequences such has T2*-weighted gradient echo, are also commonly observed in SVD <xref rid="pone.0061014-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and have been linked to cognitive impairment <xref rid="pone.0061014-Werring1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Studies conducted to date have frequently looked at one MRI measure in isolation, and most have been in relatively small patient numbers. To investigate the role of these different pathologies, we applied multimodal MRI to a well phenotyped group of patients with SVD and correlated whole brain MRI measures with cognition. Whole brain measures were chosen as they are widely used <xref rid="pone.0061014-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and technically suited to a role as a clinical marker of SVD where brain changes are anatomically diffuse and variable. We constructed multi-variable regression models to determine the strongest predictors of cognitive function. In addition, we extended upon previous investigations by assessing axial and radial diffusivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>(a)SVD patients</title><p>Consecutive patients with SVD were recruited to the St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke (SCANS) study from stroke services in three hospitals covering a geographically contiguous area of South London (St George's Hospital, King's College Hospital and St Thomas's Hospital).

Briefly, individuals aged 50–90 at study onset were recruited by random sampling of family doctor lists; all individuals in the UK are registered with a family doctor. Screening ensured subjects were without central nervous system disease including stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). As GENIE is a population study investigating age related change in cognition and MRI, no screening was conducted based on MRI data. MRI scans performed at the 2 year follow-up point were used as these were obtained using the same MRI scanner and sequences used for the SVD group. At this time point MRI data was available for 57 subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>All SVD patients were examined by a neurologist.

Within each slice, for each lesion, the user identifies a voxel near the edge of the lesion and an intensity-gradient-based algorithm uses this starting point to automatically delineate the contour of lesion extent.

T1-weighted structural images were segmented into tissue probability maps for Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF) components using the segment function of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package (version 8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>).

To minimise tissue misclassification due to the presence of lesions, WMH lesion maps were used to correct GM and WM volumes. The correction was carried out by calculating the volume of tissue classified as GM within the WMH region. This figure was then subtracted from the GM volume total and added to the WM volume total. This ensured that hypointense T1-weighted signal in the WM attributable to leukoaraiosis was not misclassified as GM for volume analysis.

T1-weighted structural images and T2-weighted FLAIR images were registered to the b0 image using 12 parameter affine registration with a normalised mutual information cost function. These transformations were applied to the tissue probability maps and WMH lesion masks. NAWM in the DTIs was classified as non-lesion voxels where the probability of WM was greater than GM or CSF.</p><p>Histograms were calculated for FA, MD, AD and RD maps for NAWM voxels.

Histogram frequencies were normalised by the total NAWM to correct for individual differences in NAWM volume.</p><p>Distributions of FA and diffusivity measures in NAWM are non-Gaussian.

Consequently complete MRI data were acquired for 115 SVD patients and 50 controls.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Cognitive Function Assessment</title><p>In the SVD group cognitive assessment was performed by a neuropsychologist using a battery of widely-used tasks chosen to characterise the cognitive impairment seen in SVD. Assessment was within 2 weeks of MRI, taking approximately 2.5 hours. Index measures summarising performance across related tasks were produced as detailed in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061014.s001">File S1</xref>. In addition a Global Cognition index was produced which summarised performance on all the tasks. Premorbid IQ was estimated using the re-standardised National Adult Reading Test (NART; 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition) <xref rid="pone.0061014-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Cognitive Index Construction</title><p>To construct each index, key measures for each task were transformed into z-scores through psychometric standardisation using the best available age-scaled normative data. An exception was the version of the modified Wisconsin Card Sort Test (mWCST), selected for brevity and sensitivity, for which a published study was used to select normative data with comparable age and gender distribution <xref rid="pone.0061014-Nagahama1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Task z-scores were averaged to create the cognitive index scores, obtaining reliable indices (see Results section)</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Missing Cognitive Data</title><p>For missing data where the subject was unable to complete the task, the minimum scaled score attainable for that task was substituted (this was 0 or 1; corresponding to z-scores of −3.33 and −3). If data were missing for other reasons, the cognitive index scores were calculated from the remaining tasks in the index to reduce the cumulative impact of sporadic data loss on sample size. Such missing data comprised 1.2%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted using R <xref rid="pone.0061014-R1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. MRI data were compared between SVD and control groups using t-tests. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted treating the 6 cognitive indices as a factor to confirm that performance was significantly different across cognitive domains. Custom linear contrasts assessed the a-priori hypothesis that executive function and processing speed would be the most impaired <xref rid="pone.0061014-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Charlton2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and would therefore show deviation scores significantly different from each of the other 4 indices. One-sample t-tests tested the null-hypothesis that each cognitive index was equal to zero–i.e. that the average performance in the group was equal to the expected performance of age-matched controls.</p><p>Within the SVD group, we examined associations between MRI parameters and the key cognitive measures that showed profile based impairment, namely Executive Function and Processing Speed (see Results section). Multiple regression models were used, adjusting for confounder variables: age, gender &amp; premorbid IQ (NART). First, models were constructed for each MRI variable controlling for confounders: “single predictor” models. Second, models including the confounders and all MRI variables were constructed to assess the relative importance of correlated predictors, these are termed “multi-predictor” models. For all models standardised regression coefficients were used to assess relative importance of predictors. Regression results were visually screened for outliers, checked for variance inflation of regression coefficients due to multicollinearity and the quality of overall fit tested with F-tests. Measures of multicollinearity are high when correlated predictors derived from directly related measures are included together in multi-variable models <xref rid="pone.0061014-Dormann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This is the case for (a) FA, MD, AD and RD histograms, (b) normalised GM, WM and total brain volumes, (c) CMB count and CMB presence variables. To avoid multicollinearity of predictors in the regression model, for each of the three sets above, only the measure with the strongest univariate association was included in the multi-predictor analysis (see Results).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Final subject numbers for analysis were 115 (SVD) and 50 (Controls).

For highly correlated MRI measures (see statistical methods section), the most significant univariate predictor was included in the multi-predictor model. For Executive Function these were total NBV, CMB count and the normalised peak height of the RD histogram. For Processing Speed, these were total NBV, CMB count and the normalised peak height of the MD histogram. As MD and RD and highly correlated, the above analyses were repeated using MD normalised peak height for Executive Function and RD normalised peak height for Processing Speed. Calculated coefficients were similar (and were identical to 2 decimal places) leading to identical model interpretation.</p><p>The regression model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061014-t004">Table 4</xref>) provided a highly significant fit for the Executive Function index; the proportion of variance explained was 0.6 (F = 19.8, p&lt;0.00001). The strongest MRI predictor of the Executive Function index was Lacunar infarct count (β = −0.227) followed by the DTI measure: normalised peak height of the white matter radial diffusivity histogram (β = 0.211). The other predictors in the model: NBV, WM lesion load and the presence of microbleeds did not reach significance. Similar results were obtained for the Processing Speed index (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5, F = 12.8, p&lt;0.0001), although NBV was now a significant predictor (β = −0.270) and the DTI measure was not (β = 0.085). Post-hoc t-tests based on standardised regression coefficients and pooled variance (analogous to the Hotelling/Williams test for dependent correlation coefficients) were conducted to look for significant differences in the regression coefficients obtained for each predictor in the two cognitive models, none reached significance.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this well phenotyped cohort of patients with symptomatic small vessel disease and radiological leukoaraiosis, we found a characteristic cognitive profile with impaired performance in executive function and processing speed, relative to working memory and episodic memory. Using a multimodal MRI approach, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this cognitive impairment. On analysis of single predictors, impaired executive function and processing speed were associated with lacunar infarct count, reduced brain volume, and white matter ultrastructural damage determined using DTI. Multi-predictor analysis showed that 60% of variance in executive function and 50% of variance in processing speed was explained by the regression model. For executive function, the strongest predictor was lacunar infarct count followed by the DTI measure. Normalised brain volume and lacunar infarct count were the predictors of processing speed. In these multivariable analyses WMH lesion load, and the presence or number of microbleeds, were not independently associated</p><p>Most, but not all, previous studies in sporadic and hereditary (CADASIL) SVD, have found an association between lacunar infarcts and cognition. The independent associations we found with lacunar infarct count may well be mediated by infarcts leading to white matter tract disruption and subsequent cortical-subcortical disconnection. Recent studies using higher magnetic field MRI have shown micro infarcts within the cortex and it is possible that these infarcts, if they associate with total lacunar infarct count, may contribute to this relationship with cognitive impairment <xref rid="pone.0061014-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The independent association found for DTI measures supports the role of white matter ultrastructural damage in causing executive dysfunction. Consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0061014-OSullivan2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Holtmannsptter1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, including the results of the large multi-centre LADIS study <xref rid="pone.0061014-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-DellaNave1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, our results show that DTI measures are more sensitive to white matter damage than WMH lesion load. We evaluated a number of markers of the DTI histogram. Associations were generally stronger and more consistent for MD than for FA.</p><p>It has been suggested that axial and radial components of the DTI tensor may give further information about the nature of neuronal damage <xref rid="pone.0061014-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> although this has not been previously studied in SVD. AD may represent a marker of axonal damage while RD has been proposed as a marker of demyelination <xref rid="pone.0061014-Burzynska1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Both ischaemic demyelination and axonal damage have been reported in neuropathological studies of SVD <xref rid="pone.0061014-Englund1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Both AD and RD were abnormal in the SVD group relative to controls, but RD was the stronger predictor of executive dysfunction. This may reflect the importance of ischaemic demyelination vs. axonal degeneration in determining the presence of cognitive impairment in SVD, alternatively it may represent relatively greater reliability of the second and third eigenvalues (RD) relative to the first (AD). This analysis has two implications. First, in studies monitoring white matter damage in SVD, RD is a better marker than AD. Second, it provides some support for the role of demyelination in SVD-related cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>Previous studies in both sporadic and genetic SVD have reported associations between brain volume and cognition, and in those studies where multimodal MRI has been performed, this association has tended to be independent of the effects of other MRI variables <xref rid="pone.0061014-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Viswanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study we found reduced whole brain volume, which was attributable to lower grey matter volume, rather than a reduction in white matter volume. Overall, whole brain volume acted as a better single predictor of cognitive performance than grey matter volume, and in the multi-predictor model a strong independent association was observed between brain volume and processing speed, but this did not reach statistical significance for executive functioning. Although counterintuitive, our finding of WM volume in the high normal range is not necessarily evidence against a key role for demyelination in SVD. While loss of myelin would be expected with volume loss, other white matter pathological processes in SVD including oedema and inflammation, might be associated with volume increase. Of relevance, investigations of WM volume in multiple sclerosis have produced inconsistent findings <xref rid="pone.0061014-Grassiot1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and this has been explained by the presence of opposing processes (inflammation, gliosis, oedema) acting to increase observed WM volume and counteract the effects of demyelination on WM volume <xref rid="pone.0061014-Grassiot1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Shiee1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>We found no association between the presence or number of microbleeds and cognitive function. Previous results have produced different conclusions as to the relationship of microbleeds to cognitive dysfunction in SVD <xref rid="pone.0061014-Werring1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The distribution of microbleeds was skewed with a large number of microbleeds in a number of patients. In a post-hoc analysis <xref rid="pone.0061014-Patel2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> we found that a high microbleed count (8 or greater, representing the top 10% of the sample) was related to executive function. However, even the contribution of high levels of microbleeds appears to explain only a small amount of the variation in cognitive function.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The term SVD is used to describe a variety of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic white matter hyperintensities in community studies, through to multiple lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis in patients with vascular dementia. Furthermore, in patients with symptomatic lacunar stroke due to SVD, it has been suggested there may be more than one underlying pathology. The role of atherosclerosis has been proposed in patients with isolated lacunar infarcts without leukoaraiosis, while a diffuse arteriopathy has been proposed in patients with multiple smaller lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis <xref rid="pone.0061014-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is possible the mechanisms causing cognitive impairment in these different situations vary. For this reason we recruited a homogenous group of patients who all presented with symptomatic lacunar infarction and had confluent leukoaraiosis on MRI. This would match with the proposed subtype characterised as secondary to a diffuse arteriopathy.</p><p>Axial and radial diffusivity measures, unlike FA and MD, are dependent on eigenvalue sorting and this effect is greater in complex brain tissue such as regions of crossing fibres and pathology <xref rid="pone.0061014-WheelerKingshott1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This has implications in interpretation of findings as caution is required in linking AD and RD measures to axonal and demyelinating pathologies in white matter <xref rid="pone.0061014-WheelerKingshott1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. White matter regions in SVD patients did not show the pattern of changes in AD described as characteristic of axonal damage. Relative to controls, AD was increased, not decreased and this may reflect different disease processes such as tissue oedema, masking the effects of axonal degeneration. Furthermore, MD and RD measures were highly correlated in this sample, and produced interchangeable results in the multivariable models. Although here we address the question of RD and AD as pathological markers separately to the question of the value of conventional MD and FA measures, the extent to which RD and MD provide meaningfully different information about the underlying tissue ultrastructure is unclear. However the results from this baseline analysis suggest they may provide similar information, at least in SVD. This, together with concerns about the validity of the AD–axonal degeneration, and the RD–demyelination link in complex or lesioned WM, suggests further research is required to fully elucidate the relationship between neuropathology and these inter-correlated measurements in SVD.</p><p>The whole brain MRI measures presented in this analysis are commonly used <xref rid="pone.0061014-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and are suited to identifying anatomically diffuse and variable SVD brain changes, however there is mounting evidence that the location of damage in SVD may be important <xref rid="pone.0061014-OSullivan3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Duering1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061014-Smith3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and provide further insight to our understanding of mechanisms in SVD.</p><p>Further longitudinal studies correlating MRI changes with cognition are now required.

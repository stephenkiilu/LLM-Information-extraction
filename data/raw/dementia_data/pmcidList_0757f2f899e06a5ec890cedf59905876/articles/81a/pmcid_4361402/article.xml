The present study aimed to identify the regional covariance patterns of microstructural white matter changes associated with AD. In this study, we applied a multivariate analysis approach, independent component analysis (ICA), to identify covariance patterns of microstructural white matter damage based on fractional anisotropy (FA) skeletonised images from DTI data in 39 AD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The multivariate ICA decomposed the subject-dimension concatenated FA data into a mixing coefficient matrix and a source matrix. Twenty-eight independent components (ICs) were extracted, and a two sample <italic toggle="yes">t-test</italic> on each column of the corresponding mixing coefficient matrix revealed significant AD/HC differences in ICA weights for 7 ICs. The covariant FA changes primarily involved the bilateral corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the cingulum, the hippocampal commissure, and the corpus callosum in AD patients compared to HCs. Our findings identified covariant white matter damage associated with AD based on DTI in combination with multivariate ICA, potentially expanding our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms of AD.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program (973 Program), China (2012CB720704), the National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF), China (81000603), the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of NNSF, China (61210001), Key Program of NNSF, China (91320201), the National Institute of Mental Health, US (RO1 MH57899), the National Institute on Aging, US (9R01AG031581-10, P30 AG19610, k23 AG24062), and the State of Arizona.

The prominent morphological alterations in AD involve not only grey matter atrophy but also white matter damage; for review, see [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. DTI, an advanced non-invasive MRI technique, can quantitatively detect the diffusion characteristics that represent the microstructure of white matter in the brain <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The existing DTI studies have suggested that white matter damage constitutes an important part of the neurodegenerative changes associated with AD [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Multiple DTI indices, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD), can detect the abnormalities in white matter in AD [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among these indices, FA, which represents the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion, is one of the most common and important parameters used to characterise the microstructural characteristics of white matter [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Earlier DTI studies applied regions of interest (ROI)-based method [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the definition of ROIs requires a priori hypothesis, and this approach is subject to the partial volume effect, especially with respect to small or thin white fibre tracts [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More recently, some DTI studies performed automated voxel-based style analysis across the entire brain [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although misregistration and smoothness-related problems may yield unreliable findings. Then Smith et al. proposed a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method, which utilises intermediate non-linear registration and projection onto the mean FA skeleton image to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of voxel-wise analysis of multi-subject DTI studies [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The above DTI studies applied univariate measures and solely focused on the differences between two groups. However, multivariate approaches, such as independent component analysis (ICA), can elucidate the covariance information hidden in imaging data, revealing the relationships between morphological characteristics and providing a representation of the identified network patterns [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An ICA model is based on a basic assumption that the unobservable source signals are statistical independent and non-Gaussian. The observed or measured signals, such as brain imaging data, can be considered as linear mixtures of independent components. Therefore, ICA is an unsupervised data-driven statistical method that decomposes linearly mixed signals into maximally independent components carrying similar inter-subject covariance information. Moreover, the mixing coefficients can be used to perform statistical analysis to examine the between-group difference. Determining the alterations in the microstructural connections of white matter associated with AD could play a vital role in understanding the fundamental pathology of AD.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to identify the regional covariance patterns of microstructural white matter changes associated with AD. We performed multivariate ICA on skeletonised FA images from patients with AD and healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, we assessed the discrimination ability between the AD and HC groups using the subject-specific mixing coefficients for each independent component.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.</p><p>The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California—San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

Twenty-eight ICs were extracted and two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test on the ICA weights for seven ICs revealed that the between-group differences were significant in AD patients compared to HCs.</p><p>For IC 1 to IC 3, the covariant FA changes primarily consisted the projection fibres, including the anterior and superior corona radiata, the posterior thalamic radiation and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, generally corresponding with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Kincses et al. performed linked ICA analysis on four DTI indices to investigate the pattern of changes in diffusion parameters in AD and found that the decreased FA primarily involved the forceps major, the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, partially in accordance with our results [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast to the study by Kincses et al., our analyses detected more significant FA abnormalities in more ICs of white matter regions.</p><p>For IC 4 and IC 5, their corresponding between-group differences in AD and HCs were significant and the covariant FA changes were found in the association fibres, especially the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the cingulum, in accordance with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The superior longitudinal fasciculus connects the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes, and the fibres in the cingulum connect the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. Guo et al. performed joint ICA on grey and white matter volume maps to construct the covariant networks and found grey matter atrophy in the middle/inferior/superior frontal and cingulate gyri, the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus and joint reductions in white matter volume in the related superior longitudinal fasciculus, the corpus callosum and the corona radiata [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results suggest that the underlying white matter connectivity may be associated with grey matter atrophy in these brain areas. The damage to the cingulum fibres may reflect axonal loss or demyelination that disconnects the posterior cingulate gyrus from the hippocampus [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, the medial temporal lobe and the posterior cingulate gyrus are essential to memory function [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings suggest that these association fibres are associated with the memory deficit in AD.</p><p>FA value varies from zero to one and describes the degree of diffusion anisotropy. Zero means that diffusion is equally restricted in all directions while one means diffusion is along only one direction. Generally, decreased FA value is caused by a breakdown in white matter fibers. However, fibers in crossing pathways have more than one direction and damaged white matter in such regions may lead to reduced number of directions thus to higher FA values. It is worth noting that, in our study, ICA weights for IC 1, IC 3 and IC 4 were higher in AD compared to HCs. While it is possible that the elevated FA in IC1, IC3 and IC4 represents the effect of reduced fiber crossing owing to degeneration of crossing pathways in AD, we note the individual source map represents the contributions of the corresponding FA to the overall connected system. They themselves are not FA values. Regardless the possible cause of the observed higher ICA weights in AD patients, our findings should be further investigated with additional studies designed to address the causes behind.</p><p>For IC 6 and IC 7, the majority of the reductions in the FA value in AD patients were detected in the hippocampal commissure and the genu and the anterior body of the corpus callosum, components of the commissural fibres; these results were similar to those of other studies [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that the reduction in grey matter volume in the hippocampus was a valuable biomarker for diagnosis of AD [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the hippocampal commissure damage in this study was related to alterations in the hippocampus. In addition, the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum were detected as important tracts connecting two resting-state networks, the bilateral prefrontal cortical regions and posterior precuneus regions [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Frisoni et al. reported reductions in grey matter density involving the frontal cortex and the precuneus, which indicates that disconnecting white matter fibres in the corpus callosum may influence the above two grey matter regions and the function of resting-state networks in AD [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The default mode network (DMN), an important resting-state network, has been generally studied, and it has been found to be altered in AD [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that understanding structural connectivity would facilitate the understanding of functional connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The superior longitudinal fasciculus, the cingulum and the corpus callosum are essential for connecting the regions involved in the DMN [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Li Luo et al. also found that anterior corona radiata and the anterior limb of the internal capsule were strongly associated with the DMN [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Those tracts are similar to our findings, which may definitively demonstrate that alterations in the projection fibres may reflect a disconnection of this functional network in AD. Greicius et al. found that AD patients exhibited decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and the hippocampus, regions which play important roles in the DMN [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We hypothesise that the disconnection of the above-mentioned fibres actually affects the activity of the DMN.</p><p>As for the ROC results and the between-group differences in the ICA weights, ICA weights for IC 1, IC 4 and IC 6 displayed the highest statistical power for between-group significance. Each IC may reflect a different aspect of the pathological changes in AD, and these ICs may represent valuable AD pathology biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis. In addition, the result of multiV-ROC revealed the discrimination ability with 89.7% sensitivity and 90.2% specificity and suggested the increased statistical power of distinguishing AD patients from HCs when using the combined ICA weights than each ICA separately.</p><p>Unlike univariate analysis methods (ROI, VBA, TBSS) which can only examine voxel by voxel alterations, the multivariate ICA approach, without any priori knowledge, can successfully identify the regional covariance patterns of microstructural white matter abnormalities associated with AD. In brief, compared with univariate analysis methods, ICA has three advantages, first, ICA decomposes the skeletonised FA maps into ICs and voxels of each IC carry covariance information. Second, the mixing coefficients can clearly explain the subjects’ contribution to the corresponding source. Third, ICA establishes a global index (subject score) free of multiple comparisons typically associated with univariate approaches. Other diffusion tensor measures (such as RD, AD, and MD) can provide different information to explain the nature of white matter changes and could be examined using ICA in future studies.</p><p>However, in this study, the multivariate ICA was applied on the subject-dimension concatenated data from AD patients and HCs together. Such performance, based on the assumption that subjects from the two groups have common ICs, could be biased. Such approach has been reportedly used in some previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0119714.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. With this approach, the resultant ICs should be interpreted with caution as the characteristics over which the group differences can be expressed. Owing to the direction of ICs is arbitrary mathematically, we also examined the negatively weighted values of the ICs (<xref rid="pone.0119714.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). There were few significant findings in spatial source maps for IC 1 and ICs 3–7 and no any findings for IC 2. However, we noticed that the positively weighted results reported in this study are primarily consistent with the existing literature. Another limitation of this study is we did not test the discrimination ability using new independent dataset from AD patients and HCs. All the ROC curves were obtained based on the original data. Besides, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and AD and it is valuable to apply the unearthed common ICs to MCI to see their predictability for the progression to AD.</p><p>In summary, we used ICA to identify the microstructural white matter abnormalities associated with AD, and these findings may expand our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms of AD at a network level. In addition, multimodal fusion is an effective method to better investigate brain networks. In a further study, we shall perform multivariate methods, such as joint ICA, on both structural MRI and DTI data for joint analysis to comprehensively investigate the anatomical changes in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119714.s001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The IC spatial maps with negatively weighted value (with a threshold of Z ≤ -3) for IC 1 and ICs 3–7.</title><p>The colour bar represents Z-score.

Standard DTI is susceptible to the effects of extracellular free water (FW), which can be removed using an advanced free-water DTI (FW-DTI) model. The purpose of this study was to compare standard and FW-DTI metrics in the context of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Data were obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) database and included both healthy controls (HC) and mild-to-moderate AD. With both standard and FW-DTI, decreased FA was found in AD, mainly in the corpus callosum and fornix, consistent with neurodegenerative mechanisms. Widespread higher AxD and RD were observed with standard DTI; however, the FW index, indicative of AD-associated neurodegeneration, was significantly elevated in these regions in AD, highlighting the potential impact of free water contributions on standard DTI in neurodegenerative pathologies. Using FW-DTI, improved consistency was observed in FA, AxD, and RD, and the complementary FW index was higher in the AD group as expected. With both standard and FW-DTI, higher values of MA coupled with higher values of FA in AD were found in the anterior thalamic radiation and cortico-spinal tract, most likely arising from a loss of crossing fibers. In conclusion, FW-DTI better reflects the underlying pathology of AD and improves the accuracy of DTI metrics related to WM integrity in Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Neurodegenerative diseases</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009797</institution-id><institution>Barrow Neurological Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Current biomarkers for AD target the dominant pathological paradigm, characterized by beta-amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as neurodegenerative changes. While much of the pathologic evidence of AD is found in gray matter, it is well recognized that concomitant white matter (WM) alterations occur in the brains of AD populations, suggesting an expanded role for WM-based biomarkers in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables the in vivo evaluation of brain microstructure and, more specifically, WM integrity by probing water diffusivity associated with axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; most commonly, diffusion-related parameters are obtained by analysis using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model. In WM, faster diffusivity along the fibers, with lower perpendicular diffusivity, yields a higher fractional anisotropy (FA). While decreased FA has been associated with demyelination, edema, gliosis, and inflammation, FA is unfortunately an indirect marker of WM integrity because the individual microscopic contributions of various non-WM components cannot be disentangled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Other DTI-derived metrics include axial diffusivity (AxD), which may be related to axonal damage, and radial diffusivity (RD), which is correlated with myelin integrity, axonal diameter and density, and fiber coherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Prior DTI studies have shown that AD is associated with lower FA and higher AxD and RD values across multiple regions in the WM, including the corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, changes in DTI metrics may precede both neuronal loss and symptoms onset, suggesting their potential role as early biomarkers. While several studies have shown a correlation between DTI-derived metrics and cognitive scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, other similar investigations have failed to show a significant correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> suggesting methodologic and/or analytic impacts on dMRI-derived data.</p><p id="Par4">Although dMRI is a well-recognized method for assessing WM, it has several limitations, including known inaccuracies related to partial volume effects (PVEs), wherein the resulting DTI metrics reflect a weighted average of multiple diffusion components within a voxel and are thus no longer specific to a single tissue type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The impact of PVEs may be particularly profound in AD, where neuronal loss leads to secondary <italic toggle="yes">ex vacuo</italic> increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and free water (FW) across the brain. To overcome the effects of extracellular FW on DTI-derived metrics, a FW correction algorithm has been developed to quantify and remove the contribution of extracellular FW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. FW-DTI has been shown to improve both tissue specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and DTI-based tract reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This model has previously been used to study several neurological diseases, including AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Using FW-DTI in a healthy aging population enriched for AD risk, Hoy et al. found that DTI-based markers of altered microstructure were significantly associated with CSF biomarkers of preclinical AD pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. FW correction may be particularly important in the fornix, due to both its proximity to the lateral ventricles and its association with the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and may also improve sensitivity to conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to uncorrected DTI metrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The FW index has separately been proposed as a standalone biomarker of AD-related pathology. This index has been associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains and may enable separation of vascular and neurodegenerative contributions to cognitive decline in the presence of mixed dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. More recently, an elevated FW index was observed in MCI and AD patients compared with healthy controls (HC), even after correction for white matter hyperintensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, none of these studies have directly compared standard and FW-DTI metrics in the context of distinguishing between AD and HC. As AD-related WM degeneration leads to a significant intravoxel FW component, FW-DTI may improve sensitivity to early brain changes and provide a clearer and more specific interpretation of results compared to standard DTI.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we compared FA, AxD, RD, and MA from both standard DTI and FW-DTI between AD and HC subjects obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) brain project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This dataset was previously used to investigate AD-related changes in the size and shape of the CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We also investigated the complementary FW index for both groups and analyzed voxel-based correlations between all DTI-derived metrics (from DTI and FW-DTI) and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that FW-DTI will improve the sensitivity and specificity for detection of WM tract abnormalities in AD. More specifically, increased FW due to neurodegeneration reduces the accuracy of diffusion-derived metrics, and thus, the removal of FW contributions improves the estimation of DTI metrics and may increase confidence in the patterns observed across DTI studies. In addition, the ability to quantify FW may yield complementary insight into sub-voxel WM neurodegenerative processes. The application of FW-DTI for AD better reflects the underlying pathology and should thus further improve interpretation of AD WM pathology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par7">All data were downloaded from the OASIS-3 brain project (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oasis-brains.org/">http://oasis-brains.org/</ext-link>), which is a neuroimaging dataset for normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease and is freely available to the scientific community.

Panels (a) and (b) show the correlations between FA and AxD, while panels (c) and (d) show the correlations between FA and RD. It should be noted that the correlations increased after FW correction (e.g., for the AD group: the correlations between FA and AxD increased from 0.160 (standard) to 0.856 (FW-corrected) and from − 0.464 (standard) to − 0.803 (FW-corrected) between FA and RD).

These panels also show that FA is less affected by the FW component than AxD and RD (i.e., the correlation for standard vs. FW FA is higher than that for AxD and RD). As AxD and RD metrics are more influenced by free-water components (i.e., have lower correlations between standard and FW metrics), this is consistent with the widespread AxD and RD changes without FW-correction. Here again, there is not a strong group difference in the correlations. Additionally, the striking differences for AxD and RD metrics between standard and FW-correction can be attributed to their biophysical origin; that is, raw diffusivity parameters AxD and RD are likely to be more impacted by intravoxel free-water diffusion than the composite metric FA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">In this study, WM integrity was assessed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease using both standard and FW-corrected DTI metrics. Although DTI is a commonly used method for assessing WM, PVEs can reduce the accuracy of DTI metrics, ultimately limiting their interpretation. To mitigate PVE, free water‐contaminated voxels were removed by incorporating a FW component in the conventional diffusion modeling pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, producing more accurate FW-corrected DTI metrics and the complementary FW index. Using both standard and FW-DTI, significant WM differences were observed between HC and AD subjects in several regions, including both higher and lower FA. Both AxD and RD were highly impacted by the effects of FW, and FW-corrected AxDt and RDt were more consistent with pathology-based expected spatial patterns of neurodegeneration. The FW index was higher in AD than HC across many regions, as expected. The FW correction method has shown promise in many neurological diseases of the WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, particularly those with neurodegenerative aspects; similarly, we now demonstrate that the application of FW correction in AD improves the accuracy and sensitivity of the resulting DTI metrics.</p><p id="Par26">Lower FA values, indicative of more isotropic motion, are consistent with neurodegenerative changes and were observed in AD in multiple regions, including most prominently the fornix and CC. Of particular interest, the fornix is the major output tract of the hippocampus and plays a major role in episodic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In the context of AD, pathological changes in the fornix may occur at an early disease stage before clinical manifestations. Lower FA and higher MD in the fornix has been a robust and consistent finding in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and may correlate with cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Similarly, FA reductions in the fornix have been identified using skeletonized tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in early-symptomatic individuals and those at high risk for developing AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, the fornix is particularly prone to PVEs due to its proximity to the lateral ventricles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which may be further exacerbated by atrophy-related ventricular expansion in AD. While decreases in standard FA may reflect a complex combination of atrophy and microstructural changes, these decreases remained after correction for FW, indicating that they reflect true pathological changes in the fornix.</p><p id="Par27">Other significant changes were observed in AD in the CC, which is a major fiber bundle responsible for interhemispheric connection. Using both standard and FW-DTI, large clusters of lower FA were observed in the genu and body with minimal splenial changes, particularly using FW-DTI. Several other studies have similarly reported decreased FA in the CC; however, these studies have shown inconsistent regional changes with AD, with some studies finding changes throughout the CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and others reporting predominant changes in the genu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or splenium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Early involvement of the genu would support the anterior-to-posterior progression of the retrogenesis hypothesis, wherein degeneration occurs in reverse of myelination. In contrast, early changes in the splenium would be consistent the posterior-to-anterior progression of Wallerian degeneration following neuronal loss, wherein WM damage is subsequent to grey matter damage. To date, conclusive evidence of a gradient pattern has remained elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Given the substantial FW component observed in the CC, the inclusion of FW correction algorithms could improve accuracy in the resulting DTI metrics in the presence of neurodegenerative changes, and future studies should consider whether the implementation of FW correction could increase confidence in the spatiotemporal patterns observed across DTI studies.</p><p id="Par28">Higher FA<sub>t</sub> in AD compared with HC was observed seemingly paradoxically using FW-DTI in bilateral ATR and CST, as well as internal capsule and corona radiata; with standard DTI, much smaller clusters of higher FA were observed in the right hemisphere (versus bilateral for FW-DTI) in the ATR, CST, PLIC and SCR (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In the presence of a unidirectional fiber tract, higher FA would suggest lower RD and/or higher AxD, which are in contrast to the expected changes in the presence of neurodegeneration. However, one of the major drawbacks of standard DTI methods is an inability to resolve different fiber orientations within a voxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, which arises from the assumption of Gaussian diffusion implicit in the tensor model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In the presence of crossing fibers, FA is artificially diminished due to multi-directional fiber tracts; thus, AD-related neurodegeneration in these regions may yield increased FA due to the loss of crossing fibers. In these cases, MA—a metric of diffusion anisotropy—may provide insight in areas of crossing fibers; moreover, higher MA has been related to a loss of crossing fibers in early AD pathology in regions with known complicated tract topologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Further corroborating the presence of fiber crossing, MA was higher in AD subjects in the right CST, PLIC, and SCR. Conversely, lower MA in AD was found in clusters in the left ATR, forceps major and minor, IFOF, UF, genu of CC, anterior CR, and EC. Similar to these results, other studies have found parallel increases of both FA and MA in AD patients in a large cluster extending along the CST and involving the ATR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The higher MA in AD subjects, together with higher FA, suggests a more linear shape of the diffusion tensor, indicative of the loss of crossing fiber populations in these areas. As the CST is relatively preserved in AD pathology, these changes suggest degeneration of fiber tracts in the ATR, CC, and fasciculus.</p><p id="Par29">Using standard DTI, non-specific higher AxD and RD were observed across WM, while FW-AxD<sub>t</sub> and FW-RD<sub>t</sub> had better agreement with regional FA<sub>t</sub> changes. This may be reflective of a larger impact of isotropic FW diffusion on AxD and RD metrics compared to FA. For example, lower FA in the CC and fornix is indicative of altered WM integrity (e.g., demyelination) in the AD group; these changes were driven by both higher AxD and RD with standard DTI, while FW correction showed that these changes in FA<sub>t</sub> may be driven by underlying lower AxD<sub>t</sub>. Using FW-DTI, lower FW-AxD<sub>t</sub> (AD &lt; HC) were found in WM locations corresponding to lower FA<sub>t</sub>, while the fornix showed simultaneous lower FW-RD<sub>t</sub> (HC &gt; AD) in a small cluster. With standard DTI, AxD was higher across multiple regions, consistent with prior literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of higher AxD is unknown and contrary to prevailing theories of known AD pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Using FW-DTI, regions of lower AxD<sub>t</sub> corresponded to lower FA<sub>t</sub> values, suggesting that prior reports of higher AxD may have been sensitive to the effects of FW. A similar trend of AxD decreasing with FW correction was previously reported using TBSS in the context of AD and cerebrovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. After FW correction, higher AxD<sub>t</sub> in AD, compared with HCs, was observed in regions with known crossing fibers, consistent with degeneration of select fiber tracts in these regions. Additionally, clusters with higher FW-FA<sub>t</sub> values in AD (e.g., ATR, CST, anterior/posterior LIC, and SFOF) were associated with higher FW-AxD<sub>t</sub> and lower FW-RD<sub>t</sub>. Using standard DTI analysis, no lower AxD or RD values were detected in AD subjects.</p><p id="Par30">The FW volume fraction was quantified using the FW-correction algorithm and, consistent with AD-related neurodegeneration, was higher in AD in many WM areas and tracts. More specifically, large clusters of higher FW were located in the cingulum (hippocampal and cingulate gyrus parts, 85.16% and 56.34%, respectively), ILF and IFOF (52% and 40%, respectively), forceps major and minor (approximately 40% each), and ATR (31.39%). Similar clusters were also found in the fornix (95.6%) and CC (genu, body, and splenium; approximately 56% of the total CC). Additionally, approximately 42% of the FW clusters were located in WM outside the regions specified by the atlases; in particular, FW increases were found in several regions bordering various sulcal fundi. Consistent with DTI-based metrics, the FW index further demonstrates an important connection between the fornix, CC, and AD. The high volume of FW in these regions may be related to loss of WM integrity; moreover, the contaminating effects of FW further validates the significant differences observed between standard and FW-DTI metrics. This metric may itself be a valuable biomarker, consistent with our hypothesis, as previous studies have shown that higher FW values were associated with poorer executive functioning, visual construction, and visuomotor performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Overall, FW-DTI provides not only more accurate and consistent DTI-based biomarkers, but also provides quantitative FW volume fractions, which may be a potential biomarker of sub-voxel neurodegenerative processes.</p><p id="Par31">Correlations between DTI metrics and various neuropsychology assessments could lend insight into the role of WM changes on cognitive function in AD pathology. In this study, we did not observe any significant voxel-wise correlations between MMSE and DTI metrics before or after FW correction in the AD cohort. This may be attributable to the similar group characteristics (predominantly very mild to mild AD) and the relatively narrow range of MMSE scores, while future studies could consider including more sensitive measures of cognitive functioning, including various sub-domains such as memory and executive function. Despite the lack of correlation in this study, the overall finding that FW-DTI metrics are more consistent with the pathology may lend insight into the inconsistent correlative findings across the literature. While the relationship between WM integrity as assessed by DTI and cognitive functions remains unsettled, the implementation of FW correction to yield more accurate DTI metrics should be considered as a methodological improvement for future correlation studies, particularly for the diffusivity metrics AxD and RD.</p><p id="Par32">There are several limitations to this study. First, we used a voxel-based approach for WM analysis rather than a skeletonized approach, such as TBSS. As TBSS minimizes tract variance across subjects using a common skeletonized tract, it uses fewer voxels and is inherently less sensitive to partial volume effects. However, the higher number of voxels available with voxel-based approaches may increase sensitivity to subtle differences in microstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Even so, all of these approaches necessitate the use of atlases, which may be limited in the WM regions that are represented (in this case, the atlases covered 84% of the WM mask); this is particularly relevant for the FW index that showed widespread changes across WM, even outside of the atlas regions. In the present study, atrophy likely minimal due to the selected patient population, further enabling the use of a voxel-based approach. Second, no significant voxel-based correlations (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01 FWE corrected) were observed between standard DTI and FW-DTI metrics and the MMSE score, which is consistent with several previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This suggests that while WM is altered in AD, the relationship between global cognitive scores and WM pathology may not be linear. Future work could consider more sensitive measures of cognitive subdomains, and the inclusion of a longitudinal aspect may further pinpoint the temporal ordering of WM alterations relative to GM pathology and cognitive decline. Finally, as early biomarkers are of increasing interest, future studies should also include cohorts of MCI or subjects at high risk of developing AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par33">In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the implementation of a FW correction algorithm for DTI improves both the sensitivity and specificity of derived DTI metrics by removing PVEs, and better captures underlying AD-related pathologic changes than standard DTI approaches. We found significantly altered DTI metrics in AD compared to HC for both standard and FW-DTI, but importantly FW-DTI identified changes were more consistent with known AD pathology as hypothesized (both in terms of magnitude and direction of DTI changes). In addition, MA may improve specificity related to crossing fibers, while the FW index may improve sensitivity to sub-voxel neurodegeneration. Overall, FW-DTI improves the reliability and inter-parameter consistency of DTI metrics in the presence of atrophy, and the resulting metrics provide more sensitive and specific insight into AD-related pathological changes in white matter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>

Cluster numbering indexes statistically independent anatomical associations within each contrast generated using the FSL cluster command. Results are corrected for multiple comparisons at whole brain level using family-wise error correction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and ordered by statistical significance and size (number of voxels in the cluster). Peak co-ordinates and anatomical associations are based on centre-of-gravity of cluster and are displayed in MNI standard space.", "n_header_rows": 1, "table_data_file": "table_002.csv"}

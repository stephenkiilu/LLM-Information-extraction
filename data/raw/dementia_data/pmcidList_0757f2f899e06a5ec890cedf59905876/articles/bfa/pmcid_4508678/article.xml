The TBSS data were further investigated using region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. ROIs were set within the corpus callosum, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), and the cerebral peduncle in reference to a standard brain template. Compared with the control group, FA values in the INPH group were significantly lower in the corpus callosum and just significantly higher in the PLIC, but no significant differences were evident in the cerebral peduncle. The much lower FA values in the corpus callosum, but not the slightly higher FA values in the PLIC, were associated with more severe clinical symptoms such as gait disturbance. The lower FA values in the corpus callosum may offer a clue to solve the pathophysiology of INPH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>elderly</kwd><kwd>gait</kwd><kwd>incontinence</kwd><kwd>ventricle</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a neural syndrome that afflicts many elderly people. Its clinical manifestations are cognitive impairment (dementia), gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence without any preceding disorders.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1)</xref></sup> As in most other advanced countries, in Japan the rapidly increasing elderly population has become a serious social issue and several reports have put the prevalence of INPH in the elderly population at 0.5–2.9%.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36)</xref></sup> As patients with INPH often need assistance for activities of daily living,<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref></sup> adequate diagnosis and treatment are essential to reducing medical and social-welfare costs in countries with aging populations.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref></sup></p><p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance (MR) technique, has recently been applied to evaluate white-matter degeneration in patients with INPH.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref></sup> Among the parameters obtained from DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) has proven useful as an index of white-matter axonal degeneration. Previous DTI studies on INPH have reported altered FA values within various supratentorial regions.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref></sup> The vast majority of these studies observed lower FA values in the corpus callosum than in normal controls.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24)</xref></sup> Beside lower FA values in the corpus callosum, some previous studies also noted that FA values in the corticospinal tract, including the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), were rather higher and were correlated with more severe clinical manifestations.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref></sup> In a DTI tractography study, Hattori et al.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref></sup> suggested that higher FA values in the PLIC could be attributed to compression of neural fibers by ventricular dilatation, which is a neuroradiological feature of INPH.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref></sup></p><p>As suggested by these previous findings, DTI-FA is a potentially useful tool for the diagnosis of INPH. However, few other studies have actually systemically analyzed whole brain FA values and assessed the relationship between FA changes and clinical manifestations. Therefore, in this study we performed tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on DTI-FA data and quantitatively assessed regional changes in FA in relation to clinical severity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Between May 2010 and April 2012, we sampled both INPH patients and control subjects.

Our routine protocol consists of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, electrocardiograms, chest X-rays, and blood sampling.

Sixty-four contiguous axial slices were obtained from each patient. The field of view was 230.4 mm × 230.4 mm, the acquisition matrix was 128 × 128, and the slice thickness was 3 mm, which resulted in voxel dimensions of 1.8 mm × 1.8 mm × 3.0 mm. Echo time was 83 ms and repetition time was 7,000 ms. Contiguous T2 weighted images were obtained using a spin-echo sequence. The field of view was 218.88 mm × 218.88 mm, the acquisition matrix was 192 × 192, and the slice thickness was 3 mm, which resulted in voxel dimensions of 1.14 mm × 1.14 mm × 3.0 mm. Echo time was 88 ms and repetition time was 5,000 ms. Fifty such axial slices were obtained from each patient. In addition, T1-weighted MR images were also obtained for other diagnostic usage.

Finally, to evaluate tensor diffusion and calculate brain FA values for each patient, DTI data was analyzed using the FDT tool (FA brain map).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Tract-based spatial statistics</title><p>The TBSS module of FSL was used to outline the brain regions exhibiting neural fiber degeneration associated with INPH. It allows the study of cerebral white matter by using the intrinsic anisotropic properties of the white matter to project the FA of local tract structures onto a virtual skeleton, thereby providing an alignment-invariant tract representation of the median part of the tract.<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref></sup> To keep the procedures simple, the default settings recommended in the TBSS manual (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS</ext-link>) were used. In brief, FA maps for each participant were registered into a standard brain template (FMRIB58_FA, part of the FSL suite) using the non-linear spatial transformation tool FNIRT. A mean FA image was then compiled by averaging aligned FA maps from each participant. Then, to generate a mean FA skeleton representing the centers of all tracts common to the group, the map threshold was set for voxels showing FA values ≥ 0.2. Aligned FA data for each participant were projected onto the standard skeletonized FA image (FMRIB58_FA-skeleton, packaged in FSL) by searching the area around the skeleton in the direction perpendicular to each tract, finding the highest local FA value, and assigning this value to the skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref></sup> Then, voxel-wise spatial statistical analysis comparing the INPH and control groups was carried out using the “randomize” program within FSL, which performs permutation testing.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref></sup> Thresholding was carried out using threshold-free cluster enhancement, a new method for finding significant clusters in MRI data without having to define them as binary units.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34)</xref></sup> Clusters were assessed for significance at P &lt; 0.05, fully corrected for multiple comparisons across space.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Region of interest analysis</title><p>For the quantitative assessment of neural degeneration within the brain, each participant's aligned FA image was projected onto the mean FA skeleton.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref></sup> Then using FSLUTILS, regions of interest (ROIs) were abstracted with reference to the standard brain for white matter (Johns Hopkins University DTI White-Matter Atlas).<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38)</xref></sup> ROIs were set within the corpus callosum, PLIC, and cerebral peduncle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Mean FA values for these voxels were then calculated.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35)</xref></sup> The derived FA values within each ROI were then statistically compared (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, P &lt; 0.05) between the INPH and control groups.</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between clinical symptoms (INPH grading scale and mRS) and FA values for the INHP patients, Spearman's rank correlation tests were performed separately for each ROI.

No such relationships were evident for the PLIC or cerebral peduncle data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to employ TBSS and undertake quantitative ROI analysis of skeletonized FA brain maps to assess the association between FA values and clinical severity in INPH. The results indicated that, for INPH patients, FA values were clearly lower in the corpus callosum and slightly higher in the PLIC compared to controls. Further quantitative analysis indicated that the lower FA values in the corpus callosum, but not values in the PLIC, were associated with more severe clinical manifestations.</p><p>Based on the observation that FA values decreased in the corpus callosum, a cut-off point for the diagnosis of INPH could plausibly be set. Recently, Fox et al. investigated the reproducibility and reliability of DTI FA values obtained from multiple scanners in different institutions and reported that FA values are relatively consistent.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref></sup> In addition, Brander et al. have reported FA norms for healthy subjects.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref></sup> However, given relatively the small patient population (N = 24) in the present study, we are reluctant to suggest any precise diagnostic criterion based on the FA cut-off value. Careful study of a larger population is needed to establish and understand the sensitivity and specificity of any such cut-off criterion.</p><p>Besides FA decreases in the corpus callosum, increased FA values in the PLIC have often been reported in INPH studies.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref></sup> In line with these studies, the present study found, using ROI analysis of skeletonized FA brain maps, significantly higher FA values in the PLIC for the INPH group (P = 0.0490). However, direct image comparisons with TBSS did not detect any voxels with higher FA values for the INPH group. Such a discrepancy could be attributed to the small differences in FA values in the PLIC between the INPH and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, FA values in the PLIC were not found to be associated with clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Accordingly, in terms of functional impairment, we assume that FA changes in the PLIC are less important than those observed in the corpus callosum in patients with INPH.</p><p>In our previous study,<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref></sup> instead of TBSS, we employed a non-linear spatial transformation to bring individual FA brain images into standard space and then compared FA values between the INPH and control groups within predetermined ROIs. The results indicated that FA values in the corticospinal tract of INPH patients were slightly lower than those in the control group.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref></sup> As the PLIC contains fibers of the corticospinal tract, the present findings for the PLIC may contradict our previous findings. To evaluate this issue, we preliminarily performed the same analytic procedure on the present dataset and obtained very similar results to our previous study. Accordingly, the differences of calculated FA values can be attributed to some as yet undetermined path dependence between the two analytical procedures. In this study, we applied TBSS that searches for the highest local FA value and assigns this value to the skeleton. Consequently, the FA values calculated from the skeletonized FA maps naturally exceed those from the original FA maps. Another possible reason is the differences obtained in the ROIs. Hattori et al. reported that, compared to normal controls, the FA values of INPH patients were lower in the lower portion of corticospinal tract and higher in the upper portion.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref></sup> Similarly, we observed that, for the INPH group compared with the control group, FA values were just significantly higher in PLIC, but not significantly different in the cerebral peduncle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Taken together, it is quite plausible that higher FA values in relatively narrow portions such as the PLIC can be diminished in wider ROI, such as the whole corticospinal tract.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. First, previous studies have shown that decreased FA values are not specific to patients with INPH; they are also typical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Because its clinical manifestation is dementia, AD is an important differential diagnosis for INPH. Several lines of study have reported that the corpus callosum FA declines in AD patients.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref></sup> Meanwhile, PD patients often suffer a gait disturbance similar to that which is presented in INPH.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref></sup> Accordingly, Gattellaro et al. have reported lower corpus callosum FA values in PD patients.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref></sup> In a recent study investigating FA differences in INPH, AD, and PD, Kanno et al. found that INPH patients had the lowest corpus callosum FA values.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref></sup> However, because no studies have yet rigorously assessed the extent of FA decrease quantitatively in INPH compared with AD, PD, and other geriatric neural diseases,<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39)</xref></sup> further studies are needed to clarify this issue. Another limitation was our use of clinically helpful, but still rather coarse, ordinal assessment of INPH symptoms (0 = normal, 4 = severe disability, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Although lower FA values in the corpus callosum were generally associated with more severe symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), significant differences were only apparent for gait disturbance. To enable more sensitive and accurate diagnosis, a more precise evaluation scale could be helpful in future studies.</p><p>In summary, this study showed a conspicuous decline in corpus callosum FA in INPH patients. In these patients, decreased FA values were associated with gait disturbance, which is the most frequent clinical manifestation. These findings suggest that low corpus callosum FA values might serve as a diagnostic marker for INPH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was partially supported by Health Labor Sciences Research Grant, Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare of Japan (2011-Nanchi-General-018) and Grand-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI [25282168])</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1)</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Hakim</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ojemann</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Sweet</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group>:

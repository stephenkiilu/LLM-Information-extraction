As one of the neuropathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an overproduction of APP and accompanying amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology are implicated as primary sources for the enhanced risk of AD in individuals with DS (<xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Wiseman et al., 2015</xref>). As the life expectancy of people with DS nearly quadrupled in the last century, from 16 years of age in the early 20th century to 60 years in 2019 (<xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Zigman et al., 2008</xref>) the prevalence of AD in this population has increased in parallel, with a lifetime risk of approximately 90% (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">McCarron et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have been used to characterize amyloid burden in DS populations and have shown increased retention of [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB (Pittsburgh compound B), which preferentially binds to amyloid plaques, in some participants by their fourth decade (30–40 years) of life and the majority with amyloid positivity (amyloid(+)) by the middle of their fifth decade (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Annus et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Lao et al., 2016</xref>). These findings reveal the emergence of PET-measured amyloid(+) status in DS approximately 30 years earlier than seen in the general (non-DS) population. However, similar to the general population, the early stages of amyloid accumulation in DS do not adversely affect cognitive function. In a study of non-demented DS participants (age 30–53), there were no significant differences in neuropsychological measures across amyloid(+) and amyloid(−) groups (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Hartley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">There are relatively few structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of aging-DS and these studies have revealed varying results (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Neale et al., 2018</xref>). Detectable changes of gray matter volume and glucose metabolism with increased amyloid were observed by <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Rafii et al., 2015</xref> in non-demented individuals with DS. Recently, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Lao et al. (2018)</xref> studied a group of non-demented individuals with DS using structural MRI and PET and found no indication of pre-AD changes in MRI-measured gray matter morphology between amyloid(+) and amyloid(−) participants. Similar to the temporal course of AD biomarkers in the general population, these studies confirm that amyloid accumulation precedes gray matter atrophy and clinical dementia onset in DS (<xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Zammit et al., 2020b</xref>). This order of events is consistent with the AT(N) model (amyloid -&gt; tau -&gt; neurodegeneration) describing the progression of AD-related biomarkers (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2018</xref>). Neurodegeneration is typically characterized by MRI-measured atrophy in the hippocampus or FDG PET patterns of hypometabolism in the precuneus, temporal and parietal cortices. Research is also ongoing to employ other neuroimaging modalities such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize microstructural changes in subcortical white matter related to neurodegeneration.</p><p id="p0035">Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive MRI technique used to probe microstructural differences in water diffusion properties of biological tissues (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Basser et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996</xref>). DTI measurements include the mean diffusivity (MD), which is the directionally averaged diffusivity and is sensitive to the density of microstructural features; and the fractional anisotropy (FA), which is a summary measure of the directional variance of diffusivities and is often used as a sensitive marker of white matter microstructural changes (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2007</xref>). Although AD is often considered a disease of gray matter, white matter degeneration is also observed. This finding has been confirmed in several studies (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Mayo et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Nowrangi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Nowrangi et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">O'Dwyer et al., 2011</xref>) that have used DTI to compare AD subjects to healthy controls. DTI investigations of white matter integrity in AD populations have reported increased MD and decreased FA in multiple white matter regions across the brain (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Mayo et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Mayo et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Nowrangi et al., 2015</xref>). These outcomes have been associated with cognitive decline and impaired executive function resulting from the deterioration of cortico-limbic, entorhinal, and cortico-cortico connections, potentially resulting from the presence of Aβ and NFTs.</p><p id="p0040">Previous DTI studies of non-demented individuals with DS have reported reduced FA relative to typically developing controls in frontal white matter connections (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Fenoll et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Romano et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al.

The goal of this study was to examine these relationships within an aging DS population, which is an important first step to evaluate whether DTI may be a sensitive marker to the microstructural changes in the early stages of Aβ deposition before evidence of GM degradation and cognitive decline. Given the near certainty of AD development and wide range of disease trajectories in individuals with DS and the marked early onset of pathology, characterizing the relationships between early white matter changes and amyloid burden in DS is essential to better understand disease progression. In this work, we investigated the relationships between [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB-measured amyloid burden in the brain with DTI measurements to assess white matter microstructure changes, as well as the effects of age on these changes, in a cohort of individuals with Down syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participant selection</title><p id="p0050">Ninety-six (n = 96) individuals with Down syndrome (average age 38.45 ± 7.98 yrs.) received baseline scans as part of the Alzheimer’s Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) study at three imaging facilities (34 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 34 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and 28 at the University of Cambridge (UC)).

Our findings reveal a positive relation of MD with amyloid over most of the association white matter pathways. Further, our cohort exhibited diffuse negative associations of FA with Aβ<sub>L</sub> in the bilateral occipital parietal and prefrontal white matter, the genu of the corpus callosum, and right temporal white matter and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Site was included as a co-variate, with significant site effects found in the cerebellum, brainstem, posterior-inferior WM tracts for FA and the corpus callosum and corona radiata for MD. Importantly, independent analyses for each site showed similar correlations of interactions of FA and MD with Aβ<sub>L</sub>. As the effects were preserved in the individual site analyses, we conclude that a site covariate within the GLM was sufficient to mitigate scanner-specific effects and no further data harmonization was needed. Since the effects are so widespread across the white matter, particularly for MD, adding other diffusion-weighted measures was not necessary to demonstrate that widespread microstructural changes are related to aging and amyloid burden in Down syndrome, thus are not included here. Further, the single-shell diffusion-weighted imaging protocol prohibited more advanced diffusion models such as either diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) or neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI).</p><p id="p0105"><xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Caballero et al. (2020)</xref> observed a significant amyloid-age interaction of MD and white matter hyper intensity volume in a cohort of non-DS, non-AD individuals, which suggested an accelerated neurodegeneration in subjects with greater amyloid and is in line with our findings in aging DS (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Caballero et al., 2020</xref>). It is well documented in geriatric imaging studies that white matter FA decreases with age and MD increases (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>). Given the trend of FA to decrease and MD to increase in prodromal and fully realized AD relative to healthy controls, our findings suggest that individuals with DS with significant amyloid show signs of neurodegeneration, similar to the findings of <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Caballero et al. (2020)</xref>.</p><p id="p0110">The association between white matter microstructure and amyloid burden using [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB PET in aging (non-DS) was investigated by <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Racine et al. (2014)</xref> and found paradoxical increased FA and decreased MD in the PiB(+) group. Subsequently, <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al. (2015)</xref> found increased FA and decreased MD accompanying low amyloid plaque burden, but this relationship was reversed for individuals with high amyloid burden, showing decreased FA and increased MD. Increased CSF measured Aβ42 was associated with increased MD in gray and white matter in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes in healthy aging adults at risk for AD (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Bendlin et al., 2012</xref>). Many, but not all of these areas, show similar patterns of white matter microstructural changes emerging in our DS cohort.</p><p id="p0115">The observed pattern of diffuse DTI changes within the association white matter in the neocortex is consistent with the earliest expected amyloid-β accumulation spatial patterns described by (<xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">Thal et al., 2002</xref>). Ultimately, it would be interesting to better understand how these white matter changes are associated with specific areas of amyloid accumulation. The interaction of age with amyloid load here does create challenges for being specific to amyloid load. Future studies using tractography (beyond the scope of this study) in a larger sample of age-matched amyloid(−) and amyloid(+) cohorts will be needed to relate the spatial distribution of white matter microstructural changes to amyloid accumulation in cortical gray matter regions.</p><p id="p0120">A potential contributing factor explaining our findings is the presence of cerebrovascular disease, particularly microbleeds (MB). MBs have been observed to occur at a higher rate in individuals with DS and contribute to increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Head et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Helman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Lao et al., 2020</xref>). MBs and CAA are linked with Aβ accumulation and AD onset (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Noguchi-Shinohara et al., 2017</xref>). In non-DS populations, both CAA (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2007</xref>) and MBs (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Akoudad et al., 2013</xref>) have been reported to influence diffusion metrics and indicate signs of decreased WM structural integrity. Since DTI is sensitive to both MBs and AD-related brain changes, our results may reflect the contributions of both cerebrovascular disease and the presence of Aβ plaques.</p><p id="p0125">We originally investigated a stratified amyloid(−) versus amyloid(+) analysis, but due to significant differences in age distributions (mean age difference = 12.6 ± 8.0 years) and the small amyloid(+) sample size (n = 19), meaningful subgroup analyses were not possible in this cohort. This led us to investigate white matter changes in relationship to age and amyloid load. It would be of great scientific interest to disentangle the interactions between amyloid accumulation and changes in white matter microstructure specific to the DS population to potentially infer causality between these neuropathological features. Future work will focus on examining the time course of these processes as additional longitudinal data are acquired.</p><p id="p0130">Our findings of significant diffuse Aβ<sub>L</sub>*age interactions highlight the complexity of uncoupling DTI, amyloid and age and warrant further study within DS and non-DS subjects alike. Since both DTI and amyloid measures are related to aging, larger, longitudinal cohort studies with more balanced age distributions will be required to disambiguate age and amyloid burden effects on DTI measures. These interaction effects, however, suggest that increased amyloid burden is associated with more rapid age-related changes in white matter microstructure.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0135">The authors would like to thank the participants and their families for their time and commitment to further discovery and understanding of the causes of AD in Down syndrome.

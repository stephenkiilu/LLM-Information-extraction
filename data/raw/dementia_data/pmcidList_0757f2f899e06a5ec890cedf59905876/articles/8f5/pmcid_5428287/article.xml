Whole brain white matter integrity of HD-monkeys was examined longitudinally from 6 to 48 months using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Progressive developmental white matter alterations in HD monkeys were widespread and were observed not only in fiber bundles connecting cortical areas to the striatum (e.g. striatal bundle and external capsule), but also in long association fiber pathways, commissural fibers, and subcortical fiber bundle. In all fiber tracts, the data indicate an arrest in white matter development around 23 months followed by slight decline until adulthood in HD monkeys. The microstructural changes parallel the progressive motor, memory and cognitive decline previously reported as HD monkeys aged. The findings revealed the widespread progressive temporal-spatial microstructural changes in HD monkey brains from infancy to adulthood, suggesting differentiated degenerations across different brain areas during brain development.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG trinucleotide sequence at the N-terminal of the exon 1 of the Huntingtin (<italic toggle="yes">HTT</italic>) gene located at chromosome 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. HD is characterized by progressive decline in motor function, cognition and psychiatric symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Death is expected in 10 to 20 years after diagnosis primarily based on motor functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Neurological and behavioral assessment is the primary approach to determine disease progression. Recent development in non-invasive neuroimaging techniques has provided a powerful diagnostic platform to evaluate neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes that may precede the appearance of clinical symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>Multiple longitudinal studies on HD patients are ongoing with a large cohort of participants that aimed to investigate disease onset and progression using unified clinical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although human longitudinal studies are important for understanding the etiology of HD, disease progression is a relatively slow process and may take decades to evolve from prodromal to clinically manifested stage. Therefore, the development of an animal model with similar genetic constitution, progressive decline in measurable clinical features and neuroanatomical structures, is important for studying HD pathogenesis, the development of biomarkers and novel therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Firstly, although rodent HD models mimic some clinical features of HD including neuropathology, these models have inherent limitations, such as brain size, neuroanatomy, neural circuitry as well as emotional response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Secondly, rodent early brain development differs greatly from primates, with greater immaturity at birth but more compressed maturation until adulthood, resulting in greater vulnerability that is not seen in humans, and/or exaggerate effects of genetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast, nonhuman primates are similar to humans in anatomical structures and functional organizations and in their ontogenetic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, white matter fiber connections between striatum and prefrontal cortex or motor domains in primates are well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The use of the HD monkey model allows us to study in the same animals the developmental trajectories of cognitive deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, motor changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, emotional and hormonal alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and the atrophy in specific neural system, such as the striatum, where mutant HTT aggregates were previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, the full spectrum of HD patient symptoms could be modeled in nonhuman primates across the lifespan and be beneficial for the identification of early markers of HD disease and treatment.</p><p>Since micro-structural changes are expected to precede macro-structural changes, comparison between macro-structural imaging and micro-structural imaging could provide insight on progressive neurobiological changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive MRI technique for investigating micro-structural integrity of neuronal fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a scalar measure of the degree of anisotropic water diffusion of brain tissues, is commonly used for quantitative assessment of changes in white matter. Additionally, mean diffusivity (MD) characterizes the overall displacement of water molecules in tissue and is also related to the microstructural features of white matter organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, axial diffusivity (D<sub>a</sub>) and radial diffusivity (D<sub>r</sub>) can be used to reveal neuropathological changes, such as the disruption and loss of axonal membranes and myelin in the fiber tracts as well as changes in size, density and organization of axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, changes of microglia cells, astrocytosis, neuronal remodeling, or loss of specific fiber tracts could change FA and diffusivities in brain structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although prior studies have suggested that DTI measurement is a valuable bio-marker to assess HD severity in human, limited longitudinal study has been performed to evaluate progressive changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this study, DTI was performed on HD monkeys and age-matched control monkeys starting at six-months and at every 6-months interval up to 48 months of age to assess changes in the integrity of the white matter across development. To perform exploratory unbiased analysis without any prior assumptions, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), a robust and sensitive approach for voxelwise multiple-subject comparisons of DTI data, was utilized to study white matter in fiber tracts and brain structures in this work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Since rhesus monkeys have shorter life-span than humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and develop progressive changes in various clinical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, HD monkeys could be an ideal preclinical animal model for efficient assessments of early disease markers and novel therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Comparisons of the age at which maximal FA value was reached for the controls and HD animals indicated significant age differences in several brain structures including both gray and white matter (see Region of Interests (ROIs) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These ROIs were selected for further analyses (see below) and included cortical areas, such as the right medial primary motor cortex (mPMC), the left ventral intraparietal cortex (VIP), and the anterior temporal area (TAa) bilaterally. ROIs in white matter included (a) long association fiber pathways, i.e. all three subcomponents of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) coursing between the parietal and frontal lobes (middle and posterior parts of SLF subcomponent I (i.e., SLF Im, SLF Ip)); anterior, middle and posterior parts of the SLF subcomponent II (i.e. SLF IIa, SLF IIm, SLF IIp); and middle part of SLF subcomponent III, the posterior part of arcuate fasciculus (AF) coursing from the parietotemporal region to the frontal lobe, the anterior part of the extreme capsule (EmC) coursing from the superior temporal gyrus to the frontal lobe, the middle and posterior parts of middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF) coursing from the parietal cortex to the temporal pole, the uncinate fasciculus (UF) coursing from the anterior temporal lobe to the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex, the occipital part of cingulum bundle (CB), parietal and mid-temporal parts of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the dorsal occipital bundle (dOB) coursing from the preoccipital region to the calcarine. Other ROIs included the striatal bundles (StB) and external capsule (EC), the commissural fibers, i.e. the corpus callosum (anterior part of CC), the projection fibers, i.e., the internal capsule (IC) traveling to the brain stem and the sagittal stratum (SS) including fibers from the occipital cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus and the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and the fornix (FX) coursing from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>TBSS analysis of the whole brain through the horizontal direction (z).

To facilitate visualization, voxels showing significant difference were thickened using the “tbss_fill” script implemented in the FSL software. In the following ROI-based analysis, DTI-derived measures within the areas were averaged from the corresponding skeletonized map (e.g., FA, in green color).

</p><p>Taking IC as an example, DTI-derived measures of both controls and HD monkeys were fitted across ages using the Poisson model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The fitting curves revealed that HD animals reached peak (FA)/bottom (MD) DTI-measures at younger ages than controls. HD monkeys also reached lower peak FA value and higher diffusivity measures (i.e., MD, Da and Dr) than control monkeys at 34 months of age. Further analyses indicated that the maximal FA value was reached at a younger age for the HD monkeys (22.7 ± 4.8 months) than for the controls (47.8 ± 11.7), revealing an arrest of white matter maturation in the HD group predicted by Poisson model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,c,e and g</xref>; see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details). Across ages, HD monkeys had significantly lower maximal FA values in all ROIs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), but significantly higher minimum MD values only in CC and EC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) as compared to controls. Finally, as compared to controls, the minimum Dr values of HD monkeys were significantly higher only in the fibers of StB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>), whereas the minimum Da values showed no difference between the two groups in all areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>; see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for details). A two-way ANOVA analysis for FA values indicated a significant interaction between age and group for all ROIs (all ps &lt; 0.05; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Post hoc analysis (Tables <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) showed that no significant FA changes were observed between the two groups in any ROI at the early ages of 6 and 12 months. By 18 months of age, only mPMC and IC showed significant group differences in FA values (p &lt; 0.05) and beginning at 24 months of age, more areas (MLF, UF, TAa, FX, SLF I, SLF II, SLF III) showed significant group differences in FA values. Finally by 42 months, significant group differences in FA values were observed in all ROIs. These results suggest that the emergence of white matter alterations for HD animals varied according to the different areas.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>An illustration of the developmental changes of the DTI-derived measures across ages for the internal capsule (IC) of HD and control animals, fitted with the Poisson model.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>White matter changes in developing HD monkey brains were investigated using DTI and TBSS analysis. Abnormal development patterns and micro-structural disruptions were observed not only in the fibers (i.e., StB and EC) connecting the cortical areas to the caudate and putamen, but also in multiple fiber tracts and few cortical areas across the whole brain. These findings are consistent with the widespread white matter loss reported in structural imaging in HD patients as the disease progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and the different onset of white matter changes in various areas could reflect different functional alterations in progressive stages in HD monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The data suggest that assessment of white matter integrity could be an effective non-invasive method to evaluate disease progression in HD monkeys and to readily translate for patient diagnoses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method aspects</title><p>The TBSS processing strategy offers voxelwise comparisons of DTI-derived measures on the skeleton maps of the whole brain to avoid inter-rater variability and has been widely used in DTI studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Temporal evolution of both brain maturation and aging has been analyzed with a quadratic regression model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The quadratic regression model assumes even slopes across both the developing and degenerating periods, thus the trend of the change would not be realistic throughout the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In contrast, the Poisson model considers different slopes in developing and aging periods and was able to capture asymmetric changes in diffusivity measurements over the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Evolution pattern of DTI indices on brain maturation and aging has been found to adequately follow the Poisson regression model in both human and non-human primates’ brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the DTI-derived measures in normal groups changed faster in the initial than the latter periods, suggesting that an increase in white matter (dendrites and spines) emerges quickly in early postnatal brain development but degenerate slowly as pruning of nonfunctional contact occurs, which is consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, significant age differences between controls and HD monkeys were detected for the minimum/maximum DTI-derive measures. The group differences for the maximum FA were detected in all areas, but those for the minimum MD and Dr were detected in fewer areas, such as CC and EC, whereas no group difference was detected for the minimum Da in any area. The results confirmed the general sensitivity of FA for the white matter changes in the HD model used. Although the mechanism is complex, FA changes in white matter could be due to alterations of myelination, axon size, fiber geometry and extracellular water space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although not as sensitive as FA, the complementary diffusivity indice changes in the white matter, such as Dr decrease, may reflect a disruption of the integrity of fiber myelin sheaths that was confirmed by electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, astrocytosis and/or microglia remodeling may change the diffusion anisotropy and diffusivity in the gray matter brain structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Considering that gray matter contains large amount of microglia cells and neuronal cell bodies but small amount of myelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, the FA changes in mPMC, VIP, and TAa could be due to either astrocytosis, neuronal remodeling, or loss of specific fiber tracts. In this study, the earlier emergence of the peak in white matter tracts maturation in the HD animals as compared to controls may mostly reflect an earlier demyelination process, whereas the earlier emergence of the peak in white matter in brain structures may be affected by earlier astrocytosis and/or microglia remodeling during development. The sensitivity of using FA was also demonstrated in the assessment of the time points at which the two groups differed in different areas (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and in more details in Tables <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The results also confirmed the ability of the Poisson regression model to detect group differences at specific ages, even though some minimum/maximum DTI-derived measures could not differentiate the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>White matter development in control monkey brains</title><p>Interestingly, in all cortical areas and fiber tracts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), control animals showed a sharp increase in white matter from birth until early adolescence (≈20–24 months) with sustained, yet reduced, growth thereafter through adolescence until adulthood (60 months). This developmental pattern parallels findings in an earlier DTI study in monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, the peak of minimum/maximum DTI-derived measures follows a posterior-anterior pattern of the development with the posterior area reaching peak values slightly earlier than the anterior areas. For example, as seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the posterior parts of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF Ip and SLF IIp) reached peak values earlier (38–39 months) than the more anterior parts (SLF Im: 47 months; SLF IIa: 57 months). Interestingly, the longest time to reach peak values was found in the most anterior frontal tract, the extreme capsule (EmC: 81 months). These data indicated a rough posterior-anterior trend for white matter development in these control animals, confirming the later white matter maturation in the frontal lobe and fiber connectivity already shown in human and rhesus monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, at 12 months of age, the FA value of frontal cortex fibers (e.g., EmC, SLF IIa) was within 0.32~0.46, whereas it was much lower (0.27~0.29) in more posterior fibers (e.g., 0.29 for SLF Ip and 0.27 for SLF IIp). These results were also consistent with previous results indicating that by 10 months (≈300 days) FA was highest in frontal regions but lowest in occipital regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. All our results showed that the white matter development in the control animals parallels similar pattern of white matter development previously reported, though the development pattern might be slightly affected by the type of rearing conditions used in different studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>White matter alterations in HD monkey brains</title><p>In all areas analyzed, white matter in HD monkeys increased at roughly the same rate as controls from birth to early adolescence (≈24 months). However, as controls continue to show a slight white matter increase thereafter until adulthood, the HD monkeys demonstrated a significant decline. This development pattern suggests a widespread arrest, and then decline of white matter development in HD monkeys.</p><p>The hallmark of neuropathological changes in HD patients is the degeneration of caudate and putamen where atrophy takes place decades before the onset of motor and cognitive deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In HD monkeys, striatal growth ceased at 24 to 36 months of age, which is much earlier than that seen in control monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the present study, maximal FA in StB fibers coursing in the external capsule on their way to the lateral putamen in HD monkeys occurred around 18 months of age, i.e. much earlier than that of the control monkeys (28 months). These data suggest early changes in the maturation of white matter that was detectable at least six months earlier than volumetric changes in the striatum of the same animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and are also consistent with the progressive impairment in motor function beginning at 16 months of age in the same HD monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, FA is a sensitive and reliable MRI-based marker for determining the alteration of the brain microstructural integration during HD progression.</p><p>In human, the caudate receives primarily projections from the lateral prefrontal cortical regions, whereas putamen receives projections from the motor areas (such as premotor, supplementary motor and primary motor cortices)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Changes of microstructural white matter of mPMC of HD monkeys was observed as early as 18 months of age, indicating that mPMC is one of the first cortical areas affected in HD model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). These findings are in line with morphological data in human HD brains, indicating a loss of SMI32 immuno-positive pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex that may result in the loss of short projecting pyramidal neurons to the premotor area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. White matter alterations in HD monkeys were also found in fronto-striatal tracts, such as the StB and EC as well as dorsal occipital bundle (dOB) and may be associated with the decline of motor and visuo-motor functions shown earlier in the same animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These data are consistent with the visual cognitive decline reported in HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p>Additional widespread white matter changes were observed in long association fiber pathways connecting the parietal lobe to the frontal lobe (SLF) and to the temporal lobe (MdLF and ILF), as well as in fiber tracts connecting the temporal lobe with the prefrontal cortex (EmC and UF) and the prestriate occipital areas with the temporal lobe, may be associated with the memory and cognitive decline observed in HD monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, as well as in HD patients as shown by functional MRI study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p>Finally, abnormal white matter changes of the corpus callosum in HD monkeys indicate interhemispheric disruptions, which is also consistent with white matter microstructural changes and atrophy in corpus callosum in HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Implications of the DTI findings in HD monkeys for HD in humans</title><p>To readily advance preclinical research for clinical translation, it is important to identify appropriate animal model with similar disease development patterns, to investigate pathogenic mechanisms and to evaluate effective treatment of inherited neurological disorders, such as HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. A non-human primate model is particularly important in modeling diseases such as HD because of progressive systemic changes throughout the body as individual aged. HD monkeys develop clinical features of HD progressively based on longitudinal assessment by neural imaging, cognitive behavioral assessment and molecular profiling studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Through longitudinal DTI study, progressive spatial-temporal white matter changes in HD brains were revealed for the first time and aligned with symptom development as disease progresses in HD monkeys. Thus, HD monkeys can potentially be used as preclinical large animal model to facilitate the development of novel biomarkers through noninvasive imaging.</p><p>Compared to control subjects, this model shows widespread white matter alterations in brain areas (i.e., frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes, cerebellum and brain stem) where macro-atrophy, micro-structural, and/or functional changes have also been found in HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Micro-structural white matter changes in the motor, sensory and cognitive brain areas are consistent with those observed in prodromal and symptomatic HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, longitudinal changes of white matter microstructures were rarely reported and these studies involved limited progressive disease stages and only adult HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. There were also case reports in juvenile onset HD patients, in whom volume losses were found in caudate nucleus and putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. These findings in juvenile onset HD patients are in agreement with the monkey results during brain development. However, due to the feasibility, developmental changes in white matter from infancy to adulthood have not yet been reported in human HD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Animals</title><p>Three HD rhesus monkeys (<italic toggle="yes">Macaca mulatta</italic>, male) were generated by using lentiviral-mediated transgenesis as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

With the Poisson model described above, the age for the minimal diffusivities (MD, Da and Dr) were derived with the fitting parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>ROI analysis</title><p>The brain regions with significant age differences in maximum FA between the controls and HD subjects were selected as regions of interest (ROIs; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Localization of each ROI was performed using atlas of the rhesus monkey brain in stereotaxic coordinates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and atlas of fiber pathways of the macaque brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Within each ROI, several other measures (the age at the maximum FA or minimal diffusivities, the maximum FA or minimal diffusivities, and FA or diffusivity values with increasing age) were averaged for further analysis (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Independent t-tests were performed using FDR correction with q value of 0.05. Additionally, a two-way ANOVA with group as the between-subject factor and age as the within-subject factor followed by post hoc analysis with p &lt; 0.05 as the significant threshold, was used to determine the FA difference between groups at different ages.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>

Unnamed: 0,Multimodal MRI techniques,Main observation targets,The main findings
1,Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI),"Gray-matter atrophy, white-matter lesions, and whole-brain atrophy","Decreased gray-matter density in frontal lobes, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex;lower cortical thickness in multimodal integration regions, such as frontotemporal regions"
2,Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast,"Identify the intrinsic spontaneous brain neural activity during resting state to investigate the brain function, such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and default-mode network (DMN)",Significant decrease in ALFF in the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and an increased ALFF in right superior orbital frontal gyrus (SOFG);increased functional connectivity (FC) between the right insular region and the right SOFG and between the right calcarine cortex and the left PHG;significant differences in functional alterations of the DMN
3,Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) measurements,Cerebral autoregulation and vasodilatory capacity,Impaired CVR may contribute to the progression of white matter disease
4,Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),"Determine the integrity and lesions of white-matter tracts, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)",Dysfunction of white matter integrity;DTI parameters (especially FA) could serve as a potent imaging indicator for detecting the invisible alteration of white matter integrity
5,Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI,"Evaluate the permeability and integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB); quantitative tissue perfusion such as blood volume, mean transit time, mean transit time",Higher BBB permeability was associated with higher LA burden and cognitive decline
6,Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),Identify changes in cerebral metabolites such as the ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) and NAA/creatine (Cr),Metabolic changes suggested that MRS can be explored as a marker for cognitive dysfunction in patients with LA

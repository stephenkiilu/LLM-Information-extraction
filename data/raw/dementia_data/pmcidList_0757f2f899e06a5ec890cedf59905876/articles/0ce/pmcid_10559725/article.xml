WMHs are associated with risk for recurrent stroke, (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) cognitive decline, (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and incident dementia (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Progression of WMH is also associated with cognitive decline (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and conversion to mild cognitive impairment or dementia (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Progressive WMH accumulation implicates cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), although WMHs are also seen in other pathologies including Alzheimer's disease. The pathophysiology of WMH progression is unclear but may be due to arteriolosclerosis, subclinical ischemia, endothelial damage with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) vasogenic edema, (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) venous stasis or collagenosis, (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) demyelination, and axonal injury (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although there are no known therapies that directly affect the progression of WMH, a better understanding of the pathophysiological changes detected on imaging preceding progression could facilitate future therapeutic development.</p><p>In patients with stroke and chronic cerebrovascular disease, imaging has helped elucidate the changes leading to WMH progression. The normal appearing white matter (NAWM) immediately surrounding FLAIR WMH is termed the WMH “penumbra” and is at greatest risk for progression into overt FLAIR WMH lesions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect impaired white matter integrity even in the NAWM, characterized by reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). DTI measures the directional diffusion of water in tissue and is more sensitive to demyelination, axonal damage, or fluid shifts than conventional MRI. In the WMH penumbra, increased MD and reduced FA can be detected, extending far past the edge of visible WMH on FLAIR (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In a longitudinal cohort study of elderly volunteers over 18 months, new WMH progression occurred mostly within 3 mm of the edge of periventricular WMH, with no new WMH voxels detected past 5 mm (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Other longitudinal studies have found that alterations in MD and FA in the WMH penumbra predict the progression of NAWM into the new WMH (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>More complex DTI models can further elucidate white matter microstructure by modeling distinct tissue compartments. DTI free water (FW) imaging models the diffusion signal as having two components: a fast, freely moving (isotropic) diffusion signal that reflects a CSF-like compartment and a slower, hindered diffusion signal that reflects tissue architecture (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Within white matter, the isolated CSF-like signal is estimated as the FW fraction. The other component of the diffusion signal modeled is the tissue tensor compartment, which can provide FW-corrected measures of WM integrity: FA<sub>Tissue</sub> and MD<sub>Tissue</sub>. These FW-corrected measures of white matter integrity may more closely reflect the integrity of underlying white matter after removing the influence of free water and CSF partial volume effects. The estimated FW signal within white matter is also relevant to the underlying physiology since it is thought to reflect interstitial fluid. Increased DTI FW in white matter is closely associated with chronic cerebrovascular disease and VCID. FW measurements outperformed conventional imaging markers of cerebral SVD in predicting disability and processing speed in sporadic SVD and CADASIL patients (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). FW is also altered in the NAWM of the WMH penumbra, suggesting altered FW is an early precursor to WMH progression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In this study of participants with prior ischemic stroke or TIA and evidence of early confluent WMH on MRI, we measured longitudinal changes in white matter FW and tested the hypothesis that increased FW is a predictor of NAWM progression to WMH remote from the infarct.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human research protocol</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics and Institutional Review Boards of NINDS/NIH (IRB Protocol Number: 18N0020), Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Bethesda, MD, and MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC (Protocol Number: 2018-093) and is registered with <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT03366129">NCT03366129</ext-link>).

Participants were excluded if they were unable to tolerate MRI, could not ambulate without assistance, could not communicate, had severe dementia as determined by a cognitive screening test, or had concurrent neurologic disease predisposing to WMH of non-cerebrovascular origin. Characteristics of the index ischemic event were derived from the medical chart and a review of available images. The etiology of the index ischemic event was classified using the TOAST classification (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The first research MRI occurred at least 3 months after a prior stroke or TIA, and serial scans were acquired every 3 months for the following year. Due to disruptions in research surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, some time points were missed. For participants that missed their 1-year time point, MRIs performed during the second year of the study were used to quantify WMH lesion growth. The data were acquired between September 2018 and October 2022.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI protocol</title><p>For each participant, brain MRIs were acquired serially on the same scanner at one of two hospital sites using a 3T Siemens Skyra or a 3T Phillips Achieva. The acquisition included a 3D T1 (resolution 1 × 1 × 1 mm), a 3D FLAIR (resolution 1 × 1 × 1 mm), an axial FLAIR (resolution ~1 × 1 × 3.5 mm), DTI (Siemens: 12 directional images with B = 1,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, 4 B = 0 images, resolution 1.7 × 1.7 × 3.5 mm or Phillips: 15 directions at B = 1,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, 1 B = 0 image, 2 × 2 × 3.5 mm), and a susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) (Siemens: 0.86 × 0.86 × 1.5 mm or Phillips: 0.57 × 0.57 × 2 mm) (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MRI processing</title><p>MRI data were analyzed using FreeSurfer v7.2 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://freesurfer.net/" ext-link-type="uri">freesurfer.net</ext-link>), (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) the FMRIB Software Library v6.0 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>), (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) DIPY 1.4 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://dipy.org/" ext-link-type="uri">dipy.org</ext-link>), (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and the Quantitative Imaging Toolkit (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cabeen.io/qitwiki" ext-link-type="uri">cabeen.io/qitwiki</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DTI processing</title><p>After correction for motion and eddy current distortions using FSL (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), a single-shell FW model was fit using DIPY (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The resulting images included the FW fraction, fractional anisotropy corrected for FW (FA<sub>Tissue</sub>), mean diffusivity corrected for FW (MD<sub>Tissue</sub>), and a trace image calculated as the geometric mean of the diffusion-weighted images.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignment of longitudinal images</title><p>For each time point, 3D FLAIR images were rigidly aligned to the T1. DTI was aligned within-subject to the T1 first using rigid boundary-based registration with the trace (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and then non-linearly using the FA. This approach provided the best anatomical alignment in the periventricular regions, where most WMH occurs. For each participant, all time point T1s were rigidly aligned to a midpoint space equidistant from all time points (to minimize longitudinal alignment bias) and averaged. For each modality, transforms to T1 and then to midpoint were combined, interpolating only once.</p></sec><sec><title>Infarcts, lesions, and tissue segmentation</title><p>Chronic infarcts were manually segmented on baseline 3D FLAIR and T1 with reference to acute MRI when available to exclude them from the regions of interest (ROI) used for analysis. The FLAIR hyperintense regions surrounding infarcts were also excluded from white matter and lesion masks. T1, 3D FLAIR, and axial FLAIR were used to segment WMH, white matter, gray matter, and CSF for each time point using FreeSurfer-based SAMSEG (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Segmentations were visually inspected and manually corrected for accuracy and to exclude FLAIR hyperintensity associated with chronic infarcts. Lesions at any time point were combined across time, the summation mask was dilated by 3 mm, and then the baseline WMH was subtracted to create a WMH penumbra for both baseline and de novo lesions remote from chronic infarcts. The WMH penumbra is at greatest risk for WMH progression in SVD, so it provides an ideal region to study the imaging changes that precede new WMH development. A prior longitudinal analysis found that most new WMH progression occurred within 3 mm of the periventricular WMH edge, and none occurred past 5 mm over a median of 18 months (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The remaining non-lesion, non-penumbra white matter comprised the NAWM mask that remained stable throughout the study period. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and lacunes were counted on SWI and FLAIR, respectively, according to established criteria (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Chronic cortical infarcts were also identified on baseline images using FLAIR and T1 as wedge-shaped FLAIR hyperintense lesions with T1 cortical hypointensity at least 5 mm in diameter in a vascular territory.</p></sec><sec><title>Localizing lesion progression</title><p>FLAIR lesion progression was determined empirically by calculating voxel-wise FLAIR intensity changes over time rather than relying on image segmentation alone. To accomplish this and permit longitudinal comparisons across scan sessions, at each time point, FLAIR intensity was normalized to the mean signal intensity of the gray matter and then denoised using a non-local means filter (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Within the WMH penumbra, the slope of FLAIR intensity change over time was calculated at each white matter voxel using linear regression. Similar to the lesion difference method employed by Schmidt et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) the regression coefficient at each voxel was converted to a Z-statistic (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) using the mean and standard deviation of the regression coefficients within stable NAWM. Z-statistics were cluster-corrected using thresholds <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> ≥ 2.3 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01 based on Gaussian Random Field Theory. Regions of significant FLAIR signal change were reviewed for both increasing and decreasing intensity changes. At the border of segmented WMH and the surrounding penumbra, there were no regions that significantly decreased in FLAIR signal intensity over the study period, so WMH penumbra voxels were classified as WMH progression or stable. Penumbra voxels demonstrating increasing FLAIR signal intensity and segmented as new lesions at later time points were classified as WMH lesion progression, while all remaining penumbra voxels were classified as stable.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Methods. <bold>(A)</bold> Tissue segmentation using FLAIR and T1 into the cerebrospinal fluid, normal appearing white matter (NAWM) (blue), gray matter (cyan), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (maroon). 3D FLAIR is normalized to mean gray matter signal intensity and then rigidly aligned to a midpoint space. <bold>(B)</bold> Normalized FLAIR intensity is regressed over time, and the slope is converted into a Z-statistic map using the mean and standard deviation of the slope within stable NAWM tissue.

Mean and standard deviation were used for normally distributed variables, while median and interquartile range were used for non-normally distributed variables. Multiple linear regression was used to identify clinical predictors of WMH growth, considering baseline WMH, age, sex, and race. Simple regression was used to test the relationship between WMH growth and additional imaging markers such as cerebral microbleeds, lacunes, and chronic infarct volume.</p><sec><title>Region of interest approach</title><p>Across four white matter ROIs (NAWM, penumbra: no growth, WMH progression, and baseline lesions), baseline differences in normalized FLAIR intensity and DTI metrics (FW, FA<sub>Tissue</sub>, and MD<sub>Tissue</sub>) were assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA and a <italic toggle="yes">post-hoc</italic> Tukey's test. Separate mixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate the mean change over time for each DTI metric or FLAIR signal intensity within these tissue ROIs. Fixed effects included tissue ROI (NAWM as reference), time, hospital site (due to potential scanner differences), age, sex, race (Black, Hispanic, or other), and baseline WMH volume, while random effects included intercepts for participants. Change within ROIs was identified as a tissue-by-time interaction, and pairwise comparisons were performed with Bonferroni correction. Residuals were inspected for normality and heteroscedasticity.</p></sec><sec><title>Voxel-wise approach</title><p>Within the WMH penumbra, each voxel was classified as either new WMH lesion progression or no growth over the study period using the voxel-wise analysis described above. For each DTI metric, logistic regression was used to test whether baseline metrics predicted voxel-wise classification of progression to WMH across all participants' pooled penumbra voxels while covarying for age, sex, race, and baseline WMH volume. Clustering of standard errors was incorporated to adjust for the non-independence of voxels within the same participant.</p><p>Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to quantify the classification performance of each baseline DTI metric's logistic regression to predict voxel-wise WMH progression. The resulting area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to compare the classification performance of the baseline DTI metrics, and bootstrap resampling was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals. We also report log-likelihood R<sup>2</sup> values (pseudo R<sup>2</sup>) from the logistic regression analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 26 participants with at least 1-year follow-up were included in this analysis (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) after excluding 1 participant with an interval ischemic stroke.

Based on our literature review, this is the first study to demonstrate the predictive properties of FW for the progression of WMH. Elevated MD<sub>Tissue</sub> and decreased FA<sub>Tissue</sub>, each corrected for FW, also preceded the development of new WMH. However, we did not detect changes in FA<sub>Tissue</sub> over time. Of these DTI metrics, baseline FW provided the best discriminatory index for predicting the local progression of WMH penumbra into new WMH, improving upon the classification performance of clinical measures alone. As expected, since WMHs were segmented and confirmed using FLAIR images, the normalized FLAIR signal increased as new WMH developed.</p><p>Locally elevated and rising FW over time likely reflects the accumulation of interstitial fluid within NAWM tissue. The accumulation of interstitial fluid contributes to the conspicuity of WMH on FLAIR. An accumulation of FW may represent fluid shifts from the vascular space to the interstitial space, which might occur in the setting of increased vascular permeability, reduced clearance, or both. Prior <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated increased BBB permeability in chronic SVD (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and pathology studies have found excess fibrinogen deposition in chronic cerebrovascular lesions, supporting this hypothesis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Alternatively, reduced clearance could occur in the setting of venous pathology, and prior studies have found an association between elevated FW and venous disruption on susceptibility-weighted MRI at 7 Tesla in patients with SVD (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Pathology studies have also found more venous collagenosis associated with a higher WMH burden (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). More recently, a role for impaired glymphatic drainage has also been proposed for the pathogenesis of WMH lesions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Arteriolosclerosis is the most common pathologic correlate to WMH on imaging, (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and arteriolar stiffening, or reduced compliance, impairs vasomotion and paravascular fluid clearance, thereby resulting in interstitial fluid accumulation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These phenomena may also be reflected by enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), which are also associated with SVD risk factors, SVD imaging markers, and cognition in SVD and stroke patients (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The FW fraction likely partially reflects fluid in the PVS since most PVS are below the resolution of diffusion imaging.</p><p>Previous studies of middle-aged to older adult community populations have also demonstrated reduced integrity of NAWM in the WMH penumbra, including reduced FA and cerebral blood flow and increased FLAIR intensity, MD, and FW (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A cross-sectional study recently demonstrated increased white matter FW extending 8 mm from the edge of FLAIR WMH in a large cohort of community participants with elevated cardiovascular risk (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Longitudinal studies have also shown that reduced FA and cerebral blood flow and increased normalized FLAIR intensity and MD precede the development of WMH over time (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Khan et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) also demonstrated DTI changes preceding new WMH development from 3 months to 1 year after ischemic stroke. By applying a 3-tissue diffusion signal composition to DTI images, they found that white matter progressing to new WMH already demonstrated more CSF-like and gray matter-like signals and less white matter-like signals at baseline compared to non-progressing NAWM (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In this study, we build upon these findings by demonstrating that elevated FW precedes progression of NAWM into WMH and provides better discriminatory classification than tissue DTI measures, suggesting that accumulation of interstitial fluid plays a key pathogenic role in the development of new WMH lesions.</p><p>While baseline FA<sub>Tissue</sub> was lower in the penumbra voxels progressing to WMH than those that did not progress, FA<sub>Tissue</sub> was lower still in the NAWM and lowest in chronic WMH. This discrepancy has been demonstrated previously and is due to normal anatomical variation in FA: more central and periventricular white matter bundles (where WMH predominates) tend to be more heavily myelinated than fibers located closer to the cortical surface (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Normalizing FA to an FA atlas of healthy controls can circumvent the anatomical variation in FA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), although we did not find reports using this approach with FA<sub>Tissue</sub> measures.</p><p>Normalized FLAIR intensity has also been identified as a sensitive, continuous measure for cerebrovascular disease. Rather than dichotomizing FLAIR images as lesions or NAWM, FLAIR intensity provides complementary information to DTI in predicting new lesions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In this study, we used normalized FLAIR intensity to reliably identify WMH growth. Most prior studies performed lesion segmentation on FLAIR and then subtracted lesion masks. To reduce the risk of false positive changes, we examined changes in normalized FLAIR intensity directly, similar to the methods developed by Schmidt et al. for the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, rather than compare two time-point differences, we evaluated the slope over multiple time points. In this manner, we identified WMHs that are reliably progressing when compared to NAWM that is not progressing. The limitations of this approach are that it may be conservative and that shorter duration fluctuations in WMH progression and regression will be missed due to the assumption of linearity. We did not find regional WMH regression in the WMH penumbra over 1 year in this cohort, but evaluation of individual time-point differences might reveal instances of WMH regression (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This method of comparing normalized FLAIR intensities voxel-wise may be less reliable in participants undergoing more dramatic brain structural changes, such as during the first 3 months after stroke (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), or over much longer time periods when significant brain atrophy is likely. However, morphometric approaches using non-linear brain alignment could be more effective for detecting voxel-wise progression, particularly when dynamic structural changes are expected.</p><p>Prior efforts to harmonize DTI acquisition and post-processing techniques for multi-site clinical studies have focused on the conventional DTI measures FA and MD, using various region of interest approaches and histogram methods to capture a whole-brain measure of SVD that best reflects clinical and cognitive status (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Similar attempts to harmonize FW measures are underway as part of the MARK VCID network (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Regional approaches, on the other hand, may capture more subtle tissue changes over shorter time periods. This may lend more power to understanding pathophysiology and detecting treatment effects, but it remains to be determined how closely these regional changes relate to disability, cognitive performance, or progression to dementia.</p><p>While the strengths of this study include multiple, frequent follow-up visits over 1–2 years (median 4 visits per participant, 112 visits total), the number of participants is relatively small, which may limit generalizability and limit our analysis of clinical risk factors or other imaging markers that may also predict WMH progression. Blood pressure control, in particular, was not measured in this study but is the most significant clinical predictor for WMH progression. However, the focus of this study was to compare the predictive value of DTI metrics within at-risk white matter regions for classifying the voxel-wise progression of WMH, for which the sample size was 953,568 voxels. Finally, while we investigated WMH remote from chronic infarction as an indicator of underlying SVD, we cannot exclude subclinical cardioembolic or atheroembolic events as additional contributors to WMH progression. While prior studies found that WMH progressed faster in the setting of prior small vessel stroke, (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) our sample size was likely insufficient to identify differential progression due to index stroke etiology.</p><p>While prior studies have evaluated longitudinal changes in FA and MD in NAWM progressing to WMH, here, we also identify longitudinal changes in NAWM FW, which has recently been reported to be more closely associated with SVD disability and cognitive processing speed than other imaging markers of SVD (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, we estimated FW by applying a bi-tensor model to DTI with a single high B-value, which requires additional assumptions, parameter initialization, and spatial regularization (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Single-shell FW methods have also been shown to be affected by tissue perfusion that may result in an overestimation of the FW content (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Multi-shell DTI would provide a more robust FW measure but requires longer scan times. For this reason, clinical DTI sequences are typically single-shell, so most of the recent studies using DTI FW in cerebrovascular disease have used similar approaches and yet have still demonstrated robust clinical relevance for the single-shell-derived FW measure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By evaluating voxel-wise longitudinal changes in white matter at risk for progression to WMHs in participants with chronic stroke, we identify FW as the most predictive DTI measure for progression, indicating that accumulation of interstitial fluid is an early event in the progression of white matter damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because data will be made available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author after close-out and publication of the parent study under a formal data sharing agreement and with approval from the requesting researcher's local Ethics Committee.

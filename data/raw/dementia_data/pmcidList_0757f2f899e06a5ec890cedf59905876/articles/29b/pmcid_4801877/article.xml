The fornix as main efferent hippocampal pathway is one of the tracts most strongly associated with age-related memory impairment. Its deterioration may predict conversion to Alzheimer’s dementia and its precursors. However, the associations between the ability to form novel memories, fornix microstructure and plasticity in response to training have never been tested. In the present study, 25 healthy older adults (15 women; mean age (SD): 69 (6) years) underwent an object-location training on three consecutive days. Behavioral outcome measures comprised recall performance on the training days, and on 1-day and 1-month follow up assessments. MRI at 3 Tesla was assessed before and after training. Fornix microstructure was determined by fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) values from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In addition, hippocampal volumes were extracted from high-resolution images; individual hippocampal masks were further aligned to DTI images to determine hippocampal microstructure. Using linear mixed model analysis, we found that the change in fornix FA from pre- to post-training assessment was significantly associated with training success. Neither baseline fornix microstructure nor hippocampal microstructure or volume changes were significantly associated with performance. Further, models including control task performance (auditory verbal learning) and control white matter tract microstructure (uncinate fasciculus and parahippocampal cingulum) did not yield significant associations. Our results confirm that hippocampal pathways respond to short-term cognitive training, and extend previous findings by demonstrating that the magnitude of training-induced structural changes is associated with behavioral success in older adults. This suggests that the amount of fornix plasticity may not only be behaviorally relevant, but also a potential sensitive biomarker for the success of training interventions aimed at improving memory formation in older adults, a hypothesis to be evaluated in future studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>white matter microstructure</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor imaging</kwd><kwd>fornix</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Fl 379-10/1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">Fl 379-11/1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">DFG-Exc 257</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002347</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">01EO0801</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">01GQ1424A</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">01GQ1420B</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5766"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related changes of brain macro- and microstructure are undisputed major contributors to memory impairments in the course of aging (Grady, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Disrupted integrity in white matter tracts as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can predict cognitive decline in healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Kantarci et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sasson et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that cognitive training in the healthy elderly led not only to improved cognitive abilities, but also induced changes in brain structure and functional activation (Belleville and Bherer, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Degen and Schröder, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Chapman et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the study by Chapman et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), older adults participated in a strategy-based cognitive training for a period of three month with DTI assessments before and after training. Increased white matter microstructural integrity in the left uncinate fasciculus was observed in the training compared to a non-interventional wait-list group. Prior studies have also shown training-induced alterations in white matter microstructure of the healthy aged brain after repeated practice of various memory tasks (Lövdén et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and mnemonic techniques (Engvig et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Lövdén et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) demonstrated increased integrity of inter-hemispheric white matter microstructure in the anterior corpus callosum as a consequence of memory and perceptual speed training over a period of 6 month. This finding of an increased white matter integrity was corroborated by Engvig et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) who moreover demonstrated an association between training-related increases in microstructural integrity and memory improvement.</p><p>Memory processes are highly reliant to hippocampal networks and age-related memory decline has been found to be particularly associated with hippocampal atrophy and decreased integrity of forniceal pathways (Metzler-Baddeley et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mielke et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fletcher et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sasson et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Douet and Chang, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The fornix carries efferent projections from the hippocampus (Mori and Aggarwal, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and is especially involved in spatial learning and memory (Postans et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Its integrity is linked to spatial performance (Postans et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) as well as to the integrity of the hippocampus (Kantarci, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, fornix integrity is decreased in healthy aging, a process accelerated in MCI and AD (Metzler-Baddeley et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pelletier et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhuang et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), has a particular role in predicting episodic memory performance (for a review, see Douet and Chang, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and may mediate hippocampal atrophy (Pelletier et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is among the earliest abnormalities in cognitively normal individuals at risk for AD (Douaud et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), may predict the conversion to MCI and AD (Douaud et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kantarci, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and thus can serve as an imaging biomarker for cognitive decline in preclinical stages of AD (Mielke et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhuang et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Douet and Chang, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Previously, fornix micro- and macrostructure have been associated with visual scene discrimination in young adults (Postans et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, a 2-h short-term training in a car-racing task had the potential to induce microstructural changes in the hippocampus (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These changes were associated with both behavioral improvement in the task as well as with white matter microstructure of the fornix (Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the predictive quality of microstructural changes in the fornix in older adults, as induced by cognitive training, on training success is still unknown.</p><p>In the present study, our aim was to investigate short-term fornix plasticity in older adults and its association to training success. Therefore, healthy older adults were administered an object-location training task (Flöel et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Külzow et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) on three consecutive days. Task performance was assessed on each training day, and on 1-day and 1-month follow-up assessments. Before and after training, participants underwent structural scanning at 3 Tesla for DTI to determine baseline values as well as changes in fornix microstructure as determined by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values. Given the particular role of the forniceal pathway, we hypothesized a specific role of its plasticity for training success. For comparison, we also assessed individual hippocampal volume from high-resolution brain images (T1) and hippocampal MD from DTI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants and Study Design</title><p>Twenty-five healthy (15 women; mean age (SD): 69 (6) years, range: 56–78) older adults participated in the study.

In brief, participants had to learn correct positions of buildings on a street map. Buildings occurred on “correct” and “incorrect” locations, the “correct” pairings of stimulus and location (total of 30 buildings) presented ten times more frequently over the course of five learning blocks. Subjects responded to 120 stimulus-location pairing in each block (60 “correct”; 60 “incorrect”) by button press. Response interval was restricted to stimulus presentation (3 s). Online feedback was not provided. Immediately after five learning blocks, learning success was tested with a cued recall and a recognition task. Here, half of the object-location associations (i.e., 15) was tested in a 3-alternative-forced-choice recall task (AFC) while the other half was tested in simple yes/no item recognition task. During AFC, participants had to indicate the “correct” positions of a building which was presented above the street map, three possible positions (one correct, two incorrect) appeared as numbers. During recognition, stimulus presentation was identical to learning blocks and participants had to indicate whether the object-location pair was correct, timing was self-paced. Recall and recognition tasks were also administered 1 day after training as well as in a 1-month follow-up assessment. Performance was measured by the percentage of correct responses. Recall performance was used as main outcome variable (Flöel et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

The results showed an association between increase in FA in the fornix from pre- to post-training with behavioral training success over training days, 1-day as well as 1-month follow-up assessment.</p><p>DTI-derived indices such as MD (i.e., molecular diffusion rate) and FA (i.e., directional preference of diffusion) are widely used to quantify the integrity of tissue microstructure and fiber organization (Johansen-Berg and Behrens, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Soares et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), with lower MD and higher FA indicating superior white matter microstructure in the majority of reports (Kantarci et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Inter-individual variability in these indices has been associated with behavioral performance variability in various cognitive tasks (Kantarci et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Antonenko et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sasson et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, these DTI metrics can be applied to study brain plasticity <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (Scholz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) as their alterations are linked to electrophysiological phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP; Matsuzaki et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Cellular microstructural alterations (e.g., density, myelin etc.), indicative of LTP induction, may thus be evident in DTI metrics. In fact, regional MD decrease correlated with concomitant brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increase that is a marker of LTP (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Neuronal changes as quantifiable by DTI metrics were induced by long-term cognitive interventions (Scholz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). First evidence that DTI metrics are also susceptible to interventions on a short timescale was provided by Assaf and his colleagues who demonstrated that short-term learning can induce structural DTI-based plasticity (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study complements these recent observations of short-term white matter plasticity and its relationship to training success (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The authors showed microstructural changes in hippocampal structures after a car-racing-task training of only 2 h (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and a correlation of training-induced hippocampal and forniceal changes with behavioral improvement in young adults (Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the present study, we did not observe alterations in MD or volume of the hippocampus from pre- to post assessments, nor associations of these brain parameters with performance. In the fornix, however, we found a decrease in MD and a corresponding increase in FA after training. The microstructural change from pre- to post-training assessment was more pronounced in the fornix MD (similar to the study of Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) with the fornix FA change not reaching statistical significance in a paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test. Note that despite FA increases in the majority of subjects, some participants showed FA decreases over the short period of time. This finding is consistent with other studies (Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, interpretation of these changes remains difficult and has to be scrutinized in future studies.</p><p>The association of fornix FA alterations with recall performance over multiple time points in our study supports a role of the fornix for learning. Linear mixed models that were adjusted for age, baseline microstructure and assessment time revealed an association between fornix plasticity and performance. Analysis of the amount of explained variance revealed that fornix microstructural plasticity may be a significant contributor to inter-individual variability in training success. Given that the difference in FA from pre- to post-training, but not fornix FA at baseline (pre), was linked to training success, we argue that the magnitude of hippocampal pathway plasticity, rather than its integrity <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>, may be predictive of learning capability (cf. Sagi et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Other studies with older adults have shown specific associations of fornix integrity and age-related cognitive decline (Metzler-Baddeley et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pelletier et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); however, our study is the first that linked training-induced structural plasticity and training success in aging.</p><p>Statistical models of hippocampal microstructure and volume did not reveal a relationship with performance. This observation may indicate a crucial role of hippocampal pathways, rather than the hippocampus itself, for learning plasticity in older adults. This assumption has also been supported by recent investigations suggesting that loss of fornix connections mediates hippocampal atrophy (Pelletier et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and fornix microstructural degradation precedes hippocampal atrophy (Zhuang et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Similarly, microstructural abnormalities in the hippocampal system seem to occur even before clinical progression to AD and its precursors (Mielke et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our results thus lend support to the hypothesis that magnitude of hippocampal pathway plasticity in older adults may be decisive for learning and memory formation.</p><p>The rapidly rising number of older adults leads to a strong increase in age-associated diseases, including MCI and AD (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). There is high public health interest for early identification of healthy individuals at risk for cognitive decline, to allow for targeted interventions in the preclinical stage, including cognitive training. Given that hippocampal pathway alterations result at least in part from the aging process (Pelletier et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying these changes, and their associations with behavioral parameters. Our study provides first evidence that hippocampal pathway plasticity may be a sensitive biomarker for success of behavioral interventions aimed at improving memory formation in older adults. Future studies have to evaluate: (i) if the plasticity induced over short time-scales may also predict long-term training success of trained items, and possibly even transfer of training effects to activities of daily life. Moreover, it should be evaluated (ii) if interventional strategies aiming to counteract early structural abnormalities in brain white matter (e.g., supplementation with high dose fatty acids (Witte et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>)) beneficially modulate both training success and structural brain plasticity, and may therefore open novel therapeutic strategies particularly for individuals with no or only limited training-induced plasticity in the naïve state.</p><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, fornix FA changes from pre- to post-training assessment were not statistically significant in a paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test. However, both MD and FA changes complemented each other in the direction of an improved white matter microstructure following training. Moreover, given the short time period, we would only expect small and not extreme alterations in regional microstructure and thus, changes may not be evident in statistical comparisons. Potential reasons may be increased noise (Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), small sample size, and also gender effects (also discussed by Sagi et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); who observed more pronounced MD decreases in males; Lisofsky et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Second, we focused on DTI metrics 1-day before and after training with no repetition of DTI assessment in a 1-month follow-up. However, we demonstrated that the magnitude of microstructure changes, as assessed directly after training, was also associated with performance at follow-up. Future studies using additional DTI measurements should now determine if structural alterations are persistent over time. Third, additional control groups that undergo no or a different intervention should corroborate the specificity of the present findings. However, we analyzed the effects of fornix FA changes on a control task as well as changes in control white matter tracts on training task performance which did not yield significant associations and thus suggests regional specificity of the findings.</p><p>In sum, our study suggests that the healthy aging brain not only retains the potential of dynamic white matter microstructure alterations but that this plasticity may be relevant for the ability to form novel memories. Specifically, fornix plasticity after brief trainings may be a sensitive biomarker for success of long-term behavioral interventions aimed at improving memory formation in older adults, a hypothesis to be evaluated in future studies. Furthermore, in individuals with no or limited plasticity after short-term training, interventions that have previously been shown to improve white matter microstructure, like omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (Witte et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>), may be evaluated as training-adjuvant means.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DA, NK, and AF designed research; DA, NK, and MEC performed research; DA, NK, MEC, KS and UG analyzed data; KS and UG provided tools for statistical analysis; DA and AF wrote the article; DA, NK, MEC, KS, UG and AF commented and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project was funded by Grants of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Fl 379-10/1, Fl 379-11/1, and DFG-Exc 257) and the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (01EO0801, 01GQ1424A, 01GQ1420B).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p><sup>1</sup><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neurobs.com">https://www.neurobs.com</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn0002"><p><sup>2</sup><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn0003"><p><sup>3</sup><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn0004"><p><sup>4</sup><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ibm.com/software/de/analytics/spss/">http://www.ibm.com/software/de/analytics/spss/</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Acosta-Cabronero</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Nestor</surname><given-names>P.

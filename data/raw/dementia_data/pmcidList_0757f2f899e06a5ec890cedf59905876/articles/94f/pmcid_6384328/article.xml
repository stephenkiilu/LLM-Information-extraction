Ideal algorithm of the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity might reveal the changes of tissue properties varying along each tract, while previous studies only detected the mean DTI parameters of each fiber. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these abnormalities of nerve fiber tracts are localized to specific regions of the tracts or spread throughout and to analyze which of the examined fiber tracts are involved in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we utilized VBA, TBSS as well as AFQ together to comprehensively investigate the white matter fiber impairment on 25 CE patients, 29 MCI patients and 34 normal control (NC) subjects. Two tract profiles, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were extracted to evaluate the white matter integrity at 100 locations along each of 20 fiber tracts and then we validated the results with 27 CE patients, 21 MCI patients and 22 NC from the ADNI cohort. Also, we compare the AFQ with VBA and TBSS in our cohort. In comparison with NC, AD patients showed widespread FA reduction in 25% (5 /20) and MD increase in 65%(13/20) of the examined fiber tracts. The MCI patients showed a regional FA reduction in 5% (1/20) of the examined fiber tracts (right cingulum cingulate) and MD increase in 5%(1/20) of the examined fiber tracts (left arcuate fasciculus). Among these changed tracts, only the right cingulum cingulate showed widespread disruption of myelin or/and fiber axons in MCI and aggravated deterioration in AD, findings supported by <funding-source id="gts0005">FA</funding-source>/MD changes both by the mean and FA changes by point wise methods and TBSS. And the AFQ findings from ADNI cohort showed some similarity with our cohort, especially in the pointwise comparison of MD profiles between AD vs NC. Furthermore, the pattern of white matter abnormalities was different across neuronal fiber tracts; for example, the MCI and AD patients showed similar FA reduction in the middle part of the right cingulum cingulate, and the anterior part were not damaged. However, the left arcuate fasciculus showed MD elevation located at the temporal part of the fibers in the MCI patients and expanding to the temporal and middle part of the fibers in AD patients. So, the AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, and may provide new insights into white matter degeneration in MCI and its association with AD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>•</label><p id="p0005">AD and MCI patients have white matter disruption compared with NC.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>•</label><p id="p0010">The abnormalities of the fiber tracts are limited to specific regions of tracts in MCI and spread throughout in AD.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>•</label><p id="p0015">The AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>Mild cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Automated fiber quantification</kwd><kwd>Diffusion tensor imaging</kwd><kwd>Pointwise comparison</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0020">Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are typical neurodegenerative disorders and the most common forms of dementia in older adults (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Ferri et al., 2006</xref>). A growing number of studies suggest that white matter microstructure differs in patients with AD and MCI compared to healthy controls; therefore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has received increasing attention because it can detect microstructural integrity of white matter fiber bundles(<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Amlien and Fjell, 2014</xref>). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are two frequently used quantitative measures of DTI that detect the anisotropy and overall displacement of water molecule diffusion (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Le Bihan, 2003</xref>). Although most researchers suggest that white matter abnormalities exist in AD and MCI, whether the patterns of white matter abnormalities are different across neuronal fiber tracts remains unknown.</p><p id="p0025">Several approaches for DTI analyses, such as region of interest (ROI) analysis, voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) have been applied in AD and MCI studies. For example, Alves reported decreased FA and increased MD in selected brain regions or certain segments of fibers in patients with AD and MCI(<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2015</xref>). However, this ROI based DTI analysis is hypothesis-dependent, and most of the brain area remains unexamined, making localization difficult. Several other previous studies used VBA and indicated a significant FA reduction in the fornix, the splenium, and several other regions (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Medina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Nir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Struyfs et al., 2015</xref>), whereas VBA is not sufficiently precise at the individual level because of the variants in the shape of long-range fiber tracts among subjects (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wassermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2011</xref>). To improve the specificity of the detection of white matter lesions, tract-based voxel grouping analysis, such as TBSS, has been employed to reveal deterioration in the limbic fibers, the fronto-occipital fasciculi, the inferior longitudinal fasciculi and other (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Damoiseaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Honea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Stricker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Zarei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bosch et al., 2012</xref>). But, there was only modest agreement between TBSS-based tract definitions and the actual location of a tract in an individual's brain (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Tsang and Wandell, 2010</xref>), and voxel-based technique cannot provide the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity along each tract.</p><p id="p0030">In summary, these white matter analysis techniques have merits and demerits respectively, and an ideal algorithm of the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity along each tract may be needed to enrich the white matter studies. In vivo, tissue properties may vary along each tract for the following reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Therefore, the diffusion measures along each fiber tract (tract profiles) of whole brain need to be further investigated (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Hattori et al., 2011</xref>). Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ) is a new algorithm that automatically identifies white matter tracts in human brains and takes measurements at anatomically equivalent locations along their trajectories (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Beaulieu et al., 2012</xref>). In this study we performed AFQ to extract FA and MD at 100 locations along 20 fiber tracts to evaluate tract profiles of the white matter integrity across AD and MCI compared with normal controls (NC). These 20 tracts include association tracts, projection tracts, commissural tracts between cortices and fibers in the limbic system. Therefore, in the current study we utilized VBA, TBSS as well as AFQ together to comprehensively investigate the white matter fiber impairment in the MCI and AD patients. We hypothesize that the abnormalities of the fiber tracts are limited to specific regions of tracts in MCI and spread throughout the tracts in AD. Furthermore, certain fibers are involved in the early stages of AD, and white matter impairment spread along fiber tracts in different patterns across all the examined fibers. We hope that as a novel algorithm, the AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, and may provide new insights into white matter degeneration in MCI and its association with AD.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p id="p0035">Eighty-eight participants were recruited from the Department of Neurology of the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital at Nanjing University Medical School from July 2013 to December 2015.

The pre-processed DTI images and 3DT<sub>1</sub> weighted images were fed into the AFQ software (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2012</xref>), which is a MATLAB toolbox and is used to identify and quantify 20 white matter tracts in each subject's brain. The technique details and parameters were exactly same to those described in the original AFQ paper(<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Yeatman et al., 2012</xref>), except that the cingulum was divided into cingulum cingulate and cingulum hippocampus in the new versions. The identification and quantification procedure steps can be summarized as 4 steps: (1) performance of whole-brain tractography for each subject. All fibers are tracked within a white matter mask using deterministic tractography; (2) segmentation of a whole brain fiber group into fascicles using an automated ROI approach. The ROIs are defined based on a previous study, and the fiber tracts are subsequently refined by comparing each fiber within the fascicle to a probabilistic fiber tract atlas (JHU white-matter tractography atlas); (3) definition of the core of the tract and filtering out of stray fibers that deviate from the core of a fiber group by representing a fiber group as a 3D Gaussian distribution before removing the fibers from the fiber group center; (4) calculation of the diffusion measurements along the trajectory of the fiber group weighing each fiber's contribution to the measurement based on its distance from the tract core. The diffusion measurement along the fiber tract core, which is a vector of 100 values, was defined as the tract profile. In this way, the tract profiles of FA and MD at 100 points along each of the 20 tracts were evaluated for each subject to depict their global white matter status.</p><p id="p0090">The 20 identified tracts included: bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), corticospinal tract (CST), cingulum cingulate (CCing), cingulum hippocampus (CHippo), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), uncinated fasciculus (UF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), splenium, and genu of the corpus callosum (CC) (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Wakana et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0095">Descriptive analyses were performed to describe the variables in each group. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. These analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, U.S.A). Continuous variables were compared between the three groups using one-way ANOVA, and then the false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed in the mean FA and MD comparisons. Then pairwise comparisons among groups were conducted when necessary with the least significance difference (LSD) test.</p><p id="p0100">For the VBA, the ANOVA was used to compare the FA and MD values in a voxel-.</p><p id="p0105">based manner with SPM and the p level was &lt;0.05. For the TBSS, a nonparametric statistical thresholding with permutation-based inference tool (FSL's “randomize”) was used to compare the FA and MD among three group and the p level set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05, corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold-free cluster enhancement.</p><p id="p0110">For the pointwise comparisons, FA and MD at 100 locations along the 20 fiber tracts were fed into a permutation-based statistical analysis with 1000 permutations. For each permutation, all the subjects were redivided into the three groups randomly, while keeping the sample sizes for each group, then the ANOVA and the post hoc test statistics were recalculated for each location of each fiber. After that, for each fiber, the maximum length of the continuous significant locations (for each location, “significant” means this location have a larger t or F statistic that corresponds to a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05) for each test was recorded, thus allowing the construction of the permutation distribution of the maximum length of significant locations; those locations with length within the top 5% of such distribution were considered significant at the 0.05 level (thus, familywise error rate corrected) (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Nichols and Holmes, 2002</xref>).</p><p id="p0115">For the comparison among the VBA, TBSS and AFQ, we calculated the percentage of significant voxels/points over the total number of evaluated voxels/points in VBA, TBSS and AFQ. Significant white matter voxels were calculated in the comparisons among groups in VBA, and tract-based voxels are calculated in TBSS. In the AFQ, we calculated the number of points with significant difference in the pointwise comparisons of the tract profiles across the 20 fiber tracts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s0050"><label>3.1</label><title>Demographics and clinical information from our cohort and ADNI cohort</title><p id="p0120">The full demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects from our cohort and the ADNI cohort are provided in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In our cohort, for the 25 patients with probable AD (12 of whom were women), the mean age was 73.48 ± 11.83 years, and for the 29 patients with MCI (13 of whom were women), the mean age was 74.07 ± 10.76 years. The 34 normal control subjects (11 of whom were women) had a mean age of 69.03 ± 11.53 years. In the ADNI cohort, for the 27 patients with AD, the diagnosis of which was based on biomarkers, the mean age was 76.00 ± 9.78 years, and for the 21 patients with MCI, the mean age was 72.52 ± 8.71 years. The 22 normal control subjects had a mean age of 73.27 ± 6.05 years. The AD, MCI and NC groups did not differ in age, sex and education both in our cohort and the validation cohort. As expected, the pathological alteration among groups led to significant differences in the scores for the MMSE and MOCA among the patients with AD, MCI, and the NCs.

In this study, we performed this method to extract FA and MD at 100 locations along 20 fiber tracts to evaluate tract profiles of the white matter integrity across AD and MCI. In comparison with NC, AD patients showed widespread FA reduction in 25% (5/20) examined fiber tracts and MD increase in 65% (13/20) examined fiber tracts. While MCI subjects showed regional FA reduction in 5% (1/20) examined fiber tracts (right cingulum cingulate) and MD increase in 5% (1/20) of examined fiber tracts (left arcuate fasciculus). Then we validated the findings with ADNI cohort, which showed significantly similar changes in the pointwise comparison of MD in AD compared to NC. In the mean FA and MD comparisons, there were no FA or MD differences reach statistical differences in MCI and NC, which was also similar finding in AD and MCI. In contrast, in the VBA analysis, widespread FA reduction and MD increase were found in AD, when compared to NC. But there was not any difference in the AD and MCI or NC and MCI. In the TBSS analysis, no significant difference was found for FA among all the three groups, while widespread MD increasing was found in AD when compared to NC, which was similar to the VBA results. In summary, using the point wise method of AFQ, we have found the location specific white matter abnormalities, which could not be achieved with the mean FA and MD analyses. Therefore, AFQ is an important supplement in the white matter studies.</p><p id="p0410">In our results of VBA analysis, almost all the white matter voxels showed difference of FA and MD in AD, compared to normal controls, but there is no significant difference between MCI and NC or AD and MCI. Therefore, VBA seems to be very sensitive to those larger differences, like AD vs. NC but have low spatial specificity. When the difference is milder (like MCI and NC or AD and MCI), it showed no difference either with FA or MD. This “all-or-none” result may because low spatial precisely of the fibers when using morphology based normalization. For TBSS, we also see an “all-or-none” result. MD elevation in inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and many other fibers in AD, compared to normal controls, but no significant results were found between AD and MCI or MCI and NC. None results was found for FA. As a tract-based voxel grouping analysis technique, TBSS partially overcome the problem of each voxel not totally on the same fiber after registration in VBA. But the inconsistent shape of fiber tract across participants may lead to error registration, such as the corpus callosum and so on. Jin et al. reported that Tract-specific analysis (TSA) can reveal detailed local alterations in each tract, which provide a 3D detailed profile that reflects local alterations in a particular tract associated with AD or MCI(<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile the AFQ showed more specific locations in fibers of MD difference in AD and NC, while it is sensitive to detect some mild alteration between MCI and NC or AD and MCI, which indicate that it has advantages, and could be a complementary method to the classic ones.</p><p id="p0415">Neurobiological systematical variation along each tract has been considered as the potential result of different patterns of white matter abnormalities across neuronal fiber tracts. Using AFQ, we found that most of the examined fiber tracts showed widespread white matter abnormalities in AD, while in MCI, only a few of the fiber tracts showed FA and MD alterations, whose findings were similar in the ADNI cohort. <italic toggle="yes">Moreover,</italic> among these changed tracts, only the right cingulum cingulate and the left arcuate fasciculus displayed obvious disruption of myelin and/or fiber axons in MCI and aggravated deterioration in AD. This finding was supported by <funding-source id="gts0010">FA</funding-source>/MD changes through both the mean, the TBSS and point wise method. We also found the location of white matter abnormalities to be different across 20 examined neuronal fiber tracts; for example, the MCI and AD patients showed similar FA reduction in the middle part of the right cingulum cingulate, whereas the anterior part were reserved. However, the left arcuate fasciculus showed MD elevation located at temporal part of the fibers in MCI and expanded to the temporal and middle part of the fibers in AD.</p><p id="p0420">In the limbic system, the fMRI studies have suggested that hypometabolism or hypo-perfusion initially occur in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Nestor et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Nestor et al., 2003b</xref>). We found the middle part or the middle component of the right cingulum cingulate showed FA reduction in both MCI and AD patients with AFQ analyses. Previous studies found hypo-metabolism of the middle cingulate gyrus in AD using 18F-FDG PET (<xref rid="bb2000" ref-type="bibr">Villain et al., 2008</xref>) and showed an Aβ load in the right posterior cingulate using <sup>11</sup>C-PIB EPT (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Furst and Lal, 2011</xref>), which were partially consistent with our results. Among association fiber tracts, the uncinated fasciculus is associated with episodic memory, the formation and retrieval of memory and cognition(<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Ebeling and von Cramon, 1992</xref>). Previous studies have reported that FA values in the uncinated fasciculus are significantly lower and MD values are significantly higher in patients with AD than in healthy controls (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Taoka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Yasmin et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we noted supportive results with TBSS and AFQ, and the ADNI cohort showed same findings with AFQ. Multiple AD-risk studies have reported reduced white matter integrity in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). One study revealed that the Aβ42/p-Tau181 ratio was positively correlated with FA in the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, suggesting this tract is involved in AD pathology (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Molinuevo et al., 2014</xref>). An MD increase more than an FA reduction in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus indicates that the deterioration from the MCI to AD might be primarily caused by the myelin degradation progress. We also found that even in AD, FA reduction and MD elevate was not significant in terms of mean diffusion measures in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, whereas using AFQ we found the left part of splenium of corpus callosum and the right part of genu of corpus callosum showed significant FA reduction. The ADNI cohort also showed similar pointwise changes of FA reduction in the corpus callosum. A previous study showed that Aβ deposition was correlated with reduced FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum but not in the entire corpus callosum(<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that there were no differences among AD, MCI or NC subjects in terms of the mean FA and MD, but there were some abnormal locations in the tract profiles using AFQ.</p><p id="p0425">The above abnormality of white matter bundles indicated the pathological process of AD. The pathology of neurofibrillary tangles shows a significantly correlation with cognitive impairment in AD, which develops first in the trans entorhinal cortex and then may spread to the entorhinal cortex in stages I and II, adjacent to the hippocampus, which is part of the limbic system in stages III and IV, followed by the medial temporal isocortex (“isocortical”, stages V/VI), and finally into the brain(<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Mufson et al., 2015</xref>). We found that in MCI, FA reduction occurs primarily in the right cingulum cingulate, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation and uncinated fasciculus, and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. At the AD stage, these pathological changes occur in additional fibers, including the bilateral corticospinal tract, left cingulum cingulate, and left cingulum hippocampus, which is consistent with previous reports of the Aβ progression pathway.</p><p id="p0430">Although we found more abnormalities of myelin or/and fiber axons in the 20 examined fiber tracts by pointwise tract profiles among the groups than mean diffusion measures, and prove AFQ is an important supplement of VBA and TBSS, there are a few limitations in this study. First, given that the AD patients are at a late disease stage, it is possible that gray matter atrophy in these patients may have a technical influence on the tractographic results, and therefore such atrophy may contribute to the observed abnormality of the tract profile. Second, DTI measurement could be associated with the prominent white matter hyper-intense lesions found in these patients. The current data are limited in their ability to distinguish these two issues. Third, because of the threshold setting in the fiber tracking, some fibers like bilateral cingulum hippocampus tracts are adjacent to the gray matter and the FA in this part were low, this may lead to fail track some fibers. Forth, the AD diagnosis was not based on biomarkers but only on the neuropsychological scales, which was subjected by our research conditions and might cause imprecise diagnosis.</p><p id="p0435">In conclusion, AFQ can automatically reconstruct white matter tracts in human brains and detect at equivalent locations along these fasciculi, which can be a complementary method for VBA and TBSS technique. We used this method in AD, MCI patients and NC subjects, and examined two diffusion parameters (FA and MD) at 100 locations along 20 white matter fiber tracts. Our results indicated that AFQ can detect changes in specific location along fibers, and the pattern of the disrupted location was different among the fibers, but in most, the disruption started from a certain region in MCI before, expanding to include entire fibers in AD, whose findings were validated by the ADNI cohort.

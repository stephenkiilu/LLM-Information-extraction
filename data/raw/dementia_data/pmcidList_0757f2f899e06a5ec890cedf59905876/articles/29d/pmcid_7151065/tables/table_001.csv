Network Properties,Characters,Descriptions
Small-world properties,Cp,"The clustering coefficient of a network that is the average of the clustering coefficient, Cp-nodal, over all nodes. It measures the extent of local cluster or cliquishness of the network."
,Lp,The characteristic path length of a network that is the average minimum number of connections linking any two nodes of the network. It measures the extent of overall routing efficiency of the network.
,Eloc,"The local efficiency of a network that is the average of the local efficiency, Eloc-nodal, over all nodes. It measures the mean local efficiency of the network."
,Eglob,The global efficiency of a network that is the inverse of the harmonic mean of the minimum path length between any two nodes. It measures the extent of information propagation through the whole network.
,"S, K",The sparsity or the cost to build a network.
Degree distribution,a,"A scalar parameter, which reflects the extent that the node degree spans within a network."
,kc,"A cutoff value, which evaluates the extent of an exponential decay."
Nodal properties,knodal,The number of edges linking a single node.
,Cp-nodal,The nodal clustering coefficient that measures the extent of inter-connectivity among the neighbors of the node.
,Eloc-nodal,The nodal local efficiency that measures the extent of information transmission among the neighbors of the node.
,Enodal,The nodal global efficiency that measures the extent of information transmission of the node with all other nodes in the network.

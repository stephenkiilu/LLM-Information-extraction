The mutant protein may confer a toxic gain of function. However, a loss of function of the normal huntingtin protein may also contribute to cause striatal and extra-striatal, e.g. cortical, neurodegeneration in HD. The neurodegenerative process in HD affects white and grey matter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and eventually leads to the emergence of clinical signs, most commonly motor signs, that allow a clinical diagnosis of manifest HD. TRACK-HD, a large longitudinal study combining clinical and structural imaging data from both premanifest and early manifest HD participants, showed that clinical measures –e.g., motor and cognitive tasks performance–and volumetric imaging tracked disease evolution associated with manifest HD, i.e. after unequivocal motor signs of HD have been noted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Structural differences in cerebral white and grey matter may be detectable as far as 15–20 years before onset of unequivocal signs of HD and have been reported using VBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and DTI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Similar to structural abnormalities, cross-sectional task-based, or ‘resting-state’ functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies have reported changes of brain function in preHD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. PREDICT-HD, a longitudinal study in premanifest HD (preHD), demonstrated that motor and cognitive task performance, and structural imaging (in particular putamen volume), improved predictions of motor diagnosis compared with models using <italic toggle="yes">HTT</italic> CAG repeat length and age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. This indicates that structural and functional changes attributable to the neurodegenerative process in HD may be evident before a clinical diagnosis of HD. It remains unclear, though, how far from motor onset a consistent signature of the neurodegenerative process in HD can be detected in preHD.</p><p>In a cohort of preHD participants very far from motor onset based on disease burden score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and predictions of years to motor onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, we used multimodal measurements to assess motor network integrity in terms of brain structure (VBM, DTI tractography), function (functional MRI and electrophysiology) and task performance. We focused on sensory-motor circuits because these circuits are relevant for the motor abnormalities that are an important part of the clinical phenotype in HD. In addition, macro-(volumetric) and microstructural (DTI) abnormalities have consistently been reported for the brain areas involved in sensory-motor circuits including cortical somatosensory projections, abnormal in manifest disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, the primary sensory cortex, in which there is evidence of thinning prior to symptom onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and white matter changes assessed using DTI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The reduction of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes of cortical components further suggests that brain function may also be abnormal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We hypothesised that we would detect differences between controls and far from onset preHD participants in measure of brain function, i.e. functional MRI and electrophysiology, while we expected that measures of brain structure (VBM, DTI tractography) would be similar in the two groups.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>White and gray matter structure</title><p>We used DTI and whole-brain GMV measures to assess structural integrity. There were no significant differences in white matter micro- and macrostructure between far from onset preHD participants and controls. In particular, WBSS of FA-maps was similar in far from onset preHD participants and controls, i.e. voxel-wise group comparison showed no statistically significant differences. Fiber tracking of the CST and TCP showed no differences of FA values between far from onset preHD participants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).

In whole-brain analyses, no significant differences between healthy controls and far from onset preHD were found. This was true for both GMV and WMV.

All measures of the motor efferent (motor evoked potential size, latency and input-output ratios; cortical silent period) and sensory afferent pathways (N20 latency; N20/P25 amplitude; long-latency reflex latencies and amplitudes) as well as a measure of sensory-motor integration (cortical relay time) were similar in controls and far from onset preHD participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> shows the electrophysiological data.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we assessed sensory-motor brain structure, brain function and clinical measures (UHDRS total motor score and cognition) in a cohort of HD gene mutation carriers far from the predicted clinical onset of HD, and controls. MRI measures of macro- or micro-structure, and brain function measured with rs-fMRI and electrophysiological techniques, as well as clinical measures were similar in the two groups.</p><p>For this study, we recruited a cohort of preHD participants who were far from the predicted age at onset and had a disease burden score which was substantially lower than in other preHD study populations (e.g. refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In agreement with many studies, we found no clinically meaningful motor signs, and cognitive task performance was similar to controls. Data from TRACK-HD suggest that clinical measures and task performance, e.g. cognition, can remain stable despite continuous loss of brain tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Brain structural changes detected with MRI are a hallmark of manifest HD and precede the onset of clinical signs of HD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. This affects grey and white matter; white matter change may precede grey matter loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and the most prominent changes reported in preHD nearer to onset are those in the striatum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Using VBM and DTI we did not find any abnormalities in our cohort of far from onset preHD. This differs from other reports in preHD that have described both macro- (e.g. GMV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and microstructural change (e.g. DTI markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Given that the disease burden score in our cohort was substantially lower than in other cohorts (e.g. refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) people with far from onset preHD may develop structural changes when they get nearer to manifesting diagnostic signs of clinically manifest HD. This suggests that, at least with the methods we used, the structural changes ascribed to the pathogenesis of HD may not be evident far from motor onset. However, it is possible that more subtle changes may be detectable depending on the methods used without impacting brain function or clinical measures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>We then examined brain function. Using rs-fMRI, intrinsic functional connectivity in two different networks was similar in far from onset preHD and controls. Several recent studies have addressed intrinsic neural function in preHD. Our findings are in accord with a study in a preHD group with a mean disease burden score of about 250 that showed preserved functional connectivity at rest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, with some evidence for M1/precuneus decoupling when employing a different analysis technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Significantly reduced synchronization in the sensory-motor network, particularly in the medial primary motor area (M1) posterior to the supplementary motor area, was detected by another study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Others have reported no difference to controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Some studies have also shown correlations between disease burden and functional connectivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This suggests that changes in functional connectivity may increase with higher disease burden. In our cohort of far from onset preHD the disease burden score was very low (median 202) compared to previous studies in which the mean disease burden score usually ranged between 250 and 300<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It is conceivable that functional differences to controls emerge only when the disease burden is higher than in our cohort. As a second method to assess brain function we used electrophysiological methods that probed the sensory-motor circuit. Similar to rs-fMRI, motor efferent and sensory afferent data were similar in controls and far from onset preHD. Previously, shallower motor evoked potential recruitment and reduced plasticity to theta burst TMS had suggested differences in synaptic function in preHD close to motor onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. It is possible that synaptic excitability changes when the biological load in HD increases similar to functional connectivity. This is consistent with a change over time in other electrophysiological measures including SEPs and long-latency reflexes even though this was measured in manifest HD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. While this does not exclude the possibility of more subtle abnormalities even in far from onset preHD, consistent with our functional connectivity data these findings are consistent with the idea that only with increasing biological load HD pathogenesis results in a phenotype that can be measured reliably with our methods.</p><p>At rest the brain is less challenged than when completing a task. Therefore, task based fMRI could be more sensitive in detecting neural activity differences in far from onset preHD. Indeed, several studies have reported differences to controls in brain activity in preHD with cognitive tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This suggests that while intrinsic brain function may be intact, extrinsic challenge may nevertheless reveal subtle changes of brain activity. However, no task-based fMRI study so far has convincingly shown that functional change is detrimental for behavioral performance. On the contrary, intact behavior even in the presence of structural loss over time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, together with an increase of task related brain activity in preHD has given rise to the hypothesis of functional compensation, i.e. an increased neural engagement or the recruitment of alternative neural pathways to meet the requirements of a given task. However, data from studies that tested this hypothesis using an a-priori defined model and longitudinal data are scarce<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>The investigation of a cohort of far from onset preHD with different modalities is a strength of this study. However, we also acknowledge several limitations. First, the number of far from onset preHD participants was low. Participants have to be recruited through an HD clinic. People carrying the HD mutation may come for predictive testing – and the uptake rate is low – but otherwise have little reason to attend a clinic. The younger they are, and hence the further from disease onset, the less likely they are to attend and, hence, the more difficult they are to recruit for research. However, using the same MRI techniques in 11 manifest HD patients compared to the same controls a pattern clearly emerged of FA and intrinsic functional connectivity differences that was very similar to what we described in a larger cohort of manifest HD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This indicates that our methods are sensitive enough to detect differences in small cohorts. The effects in manifest HD may be considerably larger than in far from onset preHD. Hence, smaller effects may not have been detected because of a lack of statistical power. While it would have been desirable to have studied a larger cohort we are nonetheless confident that changes similar in magnitude to our previous study would have been evident. We also have to acknowledge that rs-fMRI is conducted within a poorly controlled experimental environment in which brain activity at rest can be modulated by non-specific factors, such as variation in vigilance. However, since the electrophysiological data agrees with the fMRI data in showing no difference in brain function to controls this supports the notion that brain function at rest in our far from onset preHD cohort was indeed intact. It is nonetheless possible that in far from onset preHD there are more subtle differences to controls that our methods were unable to detect, e.g. changes at the intracellular or synapse level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Taken together our multi-modal assessment of a cohort of preHD participants far from onset did not reveal any differences to controls in task performance, neural micro- or macro-structure, and brain function measured with rs-fMRI and electrophysiology. The results of this study support the notion that any observable structural or functional change in preHD nearer to onset, and also in manifest HD, at least when using comparable techniques such as in this study, most likely reflects an ongoing neurodegenerative process.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>In preHD, as far as possible from motor onset, we investigated sensory-motor clinical measures, and used neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques to investigate macrostructure, microstructure, and network function.

Maps of FA, radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were computed, and a Gaussian smoothing filter of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was applied to the individual normalized FA/RD/AD-maps using a standardized procedure as previously described in detail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Next, fiber tracking was performed with a seed-to-target approach in order to study the structure of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the thalamus to somatosensory cortex connection (thalamocortical pathway – TCP). For this purpose, spherical start and target regions of interest were defined for the (1) CST start regions at (MNI x = ±6/y = −38/z = −29, r = 5 mm) and target regions (MNI x = ±20/y = −29/z = 59, r = 20 mm), and for the (2) TCP start regions at (MNI x = ±21/y = −19/z = 10, r = 5 mm) and target regions at (MNI x = ±21/y = −45/z = 47, r = 20 mm). Voxels with an FA value of above a threshold of 0.2 were considered. For the fiber tracking technique, a modified deterministic streamline tracking approach was used that takes the directional information of FTs in the vicinity into account. For these pathways, the FT algorithm was not compromised by the presence of crossing fibers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>rs-fMRI data analysis</title><p>Preprocessing of rs-fMRI data followed conventional practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Briefly, this included (1) resampling to a cubic 1 mm grid, (2) rigid body correction of head movement within runs, (3) deformation to MNI stereotaxic space using a study-specific template together with landmarks defined on the individual imaging data, (4) spatial smoothing (7 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian blur filter in each direction), (5) voxel-wise removal of linear trends and zero-meaning, and (6) temporal bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz). The rs-fMRI deformation procedures additionally considered possible gray-matter atrophy as a confounding factor on functional connectivity analysis. Two large-scale correlation maps, i.e. intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN), were computed according to previously defined well-recognized networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> using the seed-based approach, i.e., (1) motor (voxel-seeds: motor cortex; MNI coordinates: x = ±27/y = −37/z = 68) and (2) basal ganglia-thalamic (caudate nucleus; x = ±18/y = −2/z = 20).

Further correction for multiple comparisons for reduction of the alpha error was performed by a parametric correlation-based clustering procedure that discarded isolated clusters not exceeding the minimum size of 343 voxels at cubic 1 mm resolution. The resulting FA/RD/AD from fiber tracking of the CST and TCP were compared between FFO-HD and control subjects using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-<italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-test.

In VBM8, the segmentation algorithm is based on an adaptive “Maximum A Posterior” (MAP) technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. During MAP estimation local parameter variations were modeled as varying spatial functions, accounting for intensity inhomogeneity and other local intensity variations. Each participant’s original T1 image was spatially normalized and segmented into gray and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid based on MAP estimation. Segmentation was followed by partial volume estimation, data denoising based on a spatially adaptive non-local means filter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and application of Markov Random Fields. After data preprocessing, modulated normalized gray and white matter volumes (GMV/WMV) were smoothed using an 8 mm Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> level between-group analyses. GMV and WMV differences between the groups were calculated using two-sample t-test models adjusted for age and gender.

In brief, SSEPs were recorded with a silver/silver-chloride disk electrode over the somatosensory cortex (2 cm posterior of C3 in the international EEG 10–20 system) referenced against Fz. Stimulation at 3 Hz was given at 150% of the motor threshold; recordings from a total of 300 stimuli were averaged, followed by N20 latency and N20/P25 amplitude determination. Latencies were corrected for arm length measured between the cathode of the stimulation electrodes and the seventh vertebra. Surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle using silver/silver-chloride disc surface electrodes (1 cm diameter) in a belly tendon montage. The EMG signal was amplified with a universal amplifier (Toennies-Jaeger, Höchberg, Germany) and bandpass filtered (20 Hz &lt; <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> &lt; 2 kHz).

Long-latency reflexes were elicited in the contracted right abductor pollicis brevis muscle by electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>For analysis, data were first examined for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and for normal variance using Levene’s test. To examine group differences between HD gene carriers far from onset and healthy control subjects and to control for multiple testing, we used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the between subjects factor Group. As independent variables, N20 and long-latency reflex amplitudes and latencies, as well as active and rest MEP areas, and silent period duration were entered into the analysis. Statistical significance levels were set to p = 0.05.

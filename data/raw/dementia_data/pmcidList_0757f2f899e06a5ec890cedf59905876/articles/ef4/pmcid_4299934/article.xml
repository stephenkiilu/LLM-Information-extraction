In contrast to lesion detection, the quantitative assessment of white matter atrophy in individual patients has been regarded as a major challenge. We therefore tested the hypothesis that white matter atrophy (WMA) is present at the very beginning of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in virtually each individual patient. To find a new sensitive and robust marker for WMA we investigated the relationship between cortical surface area, white matter volume (WMV), and whole-brain-surface-averaged rectified cortical extrinsic curvature. Based on geometrical considerations we hypothesized that cortical curvature increases if WMV decreases and the cortical surface area remains constant.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In total, 95 participants were enrolled: 30 patients with early and advanced relapsing–remitting MS; 30 age-matched control subjects; 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 5 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>29/30 MS and 5/5 CIS patients showed lower WMV than expected from their intracranial volume (average reduction 13.0%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>− 10</sup>), while the cortical surface area showed no significant differences compared with controls. The estimated WMV reductions were correlated with an increase in cortical curvature (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 0.62, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.000001). Discriminant analysis revealed that the curvature increase was highly specific for the MS and CIS groups (96.7% correct assignments between MS and control groups) and was significantly correlated with reduction of white matter fractional anisotropy, as determined by diffusion tensor imaging and the Expanded Disability Status Scale. As expected by the predominant gray <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> WM degeneration in AD, no systematic curvature increase was observed in AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whole-brain-averaged cortical extrinsic curvature appears to be a specific and quantitative marker for a <italic toggle="yes">WMV–cortex disproportionality</italic> and allows us to assess “pure” WMA without being confounded by intracranial volume.

MRI characteristics of the disease include multifocal white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) lesions, brain atrophy, pseudoatrophy, and occult changes in normal-appearing WM and GM (<xref rid="bb0145 bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Pirko et al., 2007; Zivadinov, 2007; Zivadinov et al., 2008</xref>), highlighting the pathological significance of measures beyond lesion number and volume (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Visualizing and measuring tissue loss in the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis presents challenges, as it is inevitably easier to capture an image of conspicuous matter, such as in tumor identification, than it is to capture the absence of matter due to the disappearance of myelin sheaths, axonal loss, or cell death.</p><p>Reduction in brain volume can occur by distinct mechanisms, including inflammatory processes, such as brain oedema, and neurodegenerative events, such as the loss of myelin or axons. There is a vast amount of evidence supporting the hypothesis that pathological changes in WM volume (WMV) may occur by mechanisms that are at least partly independent of overt lesion genesis in early multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bb0020 bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chard et al., 2002; Filippi et al., 2012</xref>). The loss of WM, specifically, is considered to be of high pathophysiological relevance and not an epiphenomenon. Brain atrophy, which can be detected very early in the disease course of multiple sclerosis, is strongly related to disability, but is not well reflected by lesion load when examined in larger cohorts (<xref rid="bb0010 bb0030 bb0155 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese et al., 2007; De et al., 2010; Popescu et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>1.2</label><title>Overall hypothesis</title><p>With the evolution of more sophisticated imaging techniques, the opportunity exists to identify new, increasingly sensitive measures of tissue loss. Such a novel tissue loss-sensitive biomarker would need to avoid any confounding effects of intracranial volume (ICV), absolute brain size, or absolute CSF volume, and would have to reflect actual microstructural changes of the WM as well as functional deficits of the patients. One concept for such a “new” marker was inspired by an everyday life observation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>): that an object with signs of minimal volumetric “atrophy” would have an increased extrinsic (mean) surface curvature if the surface area remains largely constant while the volume is reduced. Thus, it was hypothesized that measuring the extrinsic curvature of the cortex may provide a reliable measure of underlying WM atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>1.3</label><title>Why measuring curvature to assess a volume?</title><p>The idea here was not to assess any absolute or relative volume. The idea was to assess a potential volumetric <italic toggle="yes">change</italic> of the WM with a single time point MRI. An <italic toggle="yes">initial</italic> (single time point) WMV estimation can principally not be used to ensure (slight) atrophy. By definition, <italic toggle="yes">atrophy</italic> is an <italic toggle="yes">acquired</italic> volume loss, but an initially estimated WMV is not related to any earlier volume. Thus we questioned if we could find a measure that must have changed from a normal value to an obviously (quantitatively) altered value if the WM selectively has shrunk in the past? As a potential candidate, we identified the cortical curvature. However, if the analogy to the apple of <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> should hold, a number of <italic toggle="yes">prerequisites</italic> must be fulfilled. We have to show that: (i) the WM volume is lower in patients with MS, (ii) the cortical surface <italic toggle="yes">area</italic> is not proportionally altered relative to healthy controls, (iii) the cortical curvature of healthy subjects has less variation than the WMV, and (iv) a volume lower than expected from normal controls is correlated with a higher curvature.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>1.4</label><title>Objective and clinical hypotheses</title><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the cortical extrinsic curvature could represent a new, robust, and sensitive biomarker to assess loss of WM brain parenchyma in an early stage of multiple sclerosis.</p><p>In this context, we tested the following clinical hypotheses:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0030"><label>•</label><p>The WM is more affected than suggested by inspecting MRI slices visually, even in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or early relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0035"><label>•</label><p>Curvature as an atrophy marker is correlated to microstructural alterations of the WM.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0040"><label>•</label><p>The cortical extrinsic curvature (a geometric measure) is possibly a more sensitive structural marker for selective WM atrophy than WMV itself.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0030"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0035"><label>2.1</label><title>Structure and concept of the study</title><p>To test the prerequisites to establish increased cortical curvature as marker for a volumetric <italic toggle="yes">change</italic> (<xref rid="s0020" ref-type="sec">Section 1.3</xref>, i–iv) and to test our clinical hypotheses, we performed a study that was structured into the following analyses.</p><p>In <italic toggle="yes">Analysis I</italic>, we estimated WMV and GM volume (GMV) in a cohort of patients with early and advanced relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (the multiple sclerosis group), age-matched control subjects (the control group) and patients with expected high atrophy of the WM and GM due to their age and a neurodegenerative condition (the Alzheimer's disease group). We were interested in how the expected WM atrophy of the relatively young patients with multiple sclerosis was quantitatively related to the atrophy observed in the Alzheimer's disease group. We further questioned how the absolute WMVs were related to (and thus confounded by) the individual ICVs. To test the hypothesis that effects seen in the multiple sclerosis group could principally also occur in individuals who are potentially in a “pre-state” of multiple sclerosis, we also included five patients with CIS (<italic toggle="yes">Part I-a</italic>). In <italic toggle="yes">Part I-b</italic> of the study, we examined individual cortical GM measures, i.e. the cortical GMV, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area of all participants.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Analysis II</italic> aimed to answer the question whether a potential WM–GM disproportion would correlate with an increased cortical extrinsic curvature as demonstrated by the apple in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (<italic toggle="yes">Part II-a</italic>), and, if so, if this increase would be specific to the patients in the multiple sclerosis group (<italic toggle="yes">Part II-b</italic>), and how age, disease duration, and lesion load would be related to any potential curvature alteration (<italic toggle="yes">Part II-c</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">Analysis III</italic> should reveal if any potential geometric properties of the cortex are associated with intrinsic microstructural alterations of the WM as they can be determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Analysis IV</italic> should clarify if an increase in the cortical extrinsic curvature has any functional correlate, i.e. is related to the disease progression as expressed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (<italic toggle="yes">Part IV-a</italic>), and, if so, whether this measure would better correlate with the EDSS than the estimated individual volumetric loss of WM brain parenchyma (denoted in the following as “ΔWMV”) or the individual WM lesion load (<italic toggle="yes">Part IV-b</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.2</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty consecutive patients with early and advanced relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (EDSS: range 1–5.5, median 1.5; disease duration: range 14–265 months, median 71.5 months) attending our clinic and diagnosed according to revised McDonald criteria (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Polman et al., 2011</xref>), were assigned to high-resolution structural and diffusion-weighted MRI at 3 T (age: mean 37.9 years, median 36 years, range 26–56 years, standard deviation [SD] 8.5 years). As control subjects (the control group), 30 age-matched neurologically and psychiatrically healthy volunteers were included in the study (age: mean 38.1 years, median 34.5 years, range 23–69 years, SD 13.3 years, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test: <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 0.08, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.93). The latter subjects were recruited by announcements in local newspapers. The only selection criterion was age to guarantee equal age distribution between both groups. Additionally, a reference group of 30 randomly selected patients with Alzheimer's disease — a neurodegenerative disease known to <italic toggle="yes">strongly</italic> affect WMV <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> GMV was also included (age: mean 65.6 years, range 46–72 years, SD 6.3 years).

A triangle-based mesh of the WM surface is produced through tessellation, which is subsequently deformed outward to generate the pial surface before automatic correction of topological defects in the resulting main fold. Cortical thickness mean and Gaussian intrinsic curvature measurements were obtained at each vertex by reconstructing representations of the GM–WM boundary and the pial surface.

Thus the whole quantitative brain analysis was completely objective and could not be biased by any subjective factor. Local cortical thickness, rectified extrinsic and Gaussian curvature had been averaged over both cerebral hemispheres using software tools incorporated into FreeSurfer software for each examined individual. Additionally, we calculated the individual total cortical surface area. From the segmented data, we used the cortical WMV and the cortex volume as calculated by FreeSurfer. By summarizing the volumes of WM hypointensities as detected by FreeSurfer in the 3D T1w images we assessed the individual WM “lesion load”.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>2.6</label><title>Group analysis</title><p>For the group analyses of all estimated end points, methods based on the Generalized Linear Model (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA) and discriminant function analysis as provided by the software STATISTICA Version 10 (2011; Stat Soft.

Most notably, an increased cortical curvature was even shown in patients with CIS, a potentially early sign of multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that the curvature increase was most likely caused by WM atrophy in each individual subject (<xref rid="f0015 f0030 f0050" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3, 6, and 10</xref>) and arose due to an imbalance of cortex surface area and WMV. A mean WMV reduction of 13.0% was seen in the multiple sclerosis group, with 29/30 patients showing a negative ΔWMV; in contrast, there were no relevant differences seen in cortical volume or surface area between the patients with multiple sclerosis and the control group (<xref rid="f0020 f0025" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 and 5</xref>).</p><p>The increased cortical extrinsic curvature in the multiple sclerosis group is not an abstract mathematical expression from differential geometry, but can actually be seen in MRI slices when compared with subjects with an average curvature (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A, B). The WM shrinkage is also visible, if 3D reconstructed WM surfaces are compared (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) (see also <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Voets et al., 2011</xref>). An increased cortical extrinsic curvature seems to be specific to primary WMV loss and a <italic toggle="yes">nearly</italic> (but not fully) intact cerebral cortex. In patients with neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease, it can be assumed that because of the disease and the age of these patients, the cortex <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> WM were degenerated. There was no systematic disproportion of WMV and cortical GM surface, and, thus, no systematic change in the cortical curvature (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This finding further supports the hypothesis that the WM–GM disproportion is causative of the increased extrinsic curvature.</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><label>4.2</label><title>Estimation of reduced WMV by ΔWMV</title><p>The WMV loss in our study was assessed by an <italic toggle="yes">apparent peculiar</italic> new measure, i.e. ΔWMV. The rationale in favor of this method and against ICV-normalized WM volume or WM fraction was, that ΔWMV is obviously not confounded by whole brain/GM atrophy. A second reason was that ΔWMV allowed easily assessing the absolute volume difference compared to the expectation value of normal controls, i.e. a negative value makes immediately clear that the volume is XY mm<sup>3</sup> below the normal average. The calculation of an expectation value for normal WMV was possible due to the strong linear relation between ICV and WMV in healthy controls (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, it should be noted here, that a negative ΔWMV does not automatically mean that the WM is atrophic. Fifty percent of the healthy subjects have per definition a negative ΔWMV.</p></sec><sec id="s0130"><label>4.3</label><title>Volume loss and microstructure</title><p>To investigate how increased extrinsic curvature is related to potential microstructural alterations of the WM, we employed DTI to assess microstructural tissue damage in normal-appearing WM (<xref rid="bb0040 bb0050 bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Deppe et al., 2008; Duning et al., 2010; Keller et al., 2013</xref>). For this purpose, we calculated the FA within a ROI outlining the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was selected for the following three reasons. Firstly, axonal damage in conjunction with WM atrophy in the normal-appearing WM of the corpus callosum in postmortem brains of patients with multiple sclerosis was already demonstrated by using quantitative measures of both axonal density and WM atrophy (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Evangelou et al., 2000</xref>). Secondly, the corpus callosum contains virtually no crossing fibers, so that this ROI seemed particularly qualified to quantify neuronal integrity loss by FA derived from a second-order tensor model (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Deppe et al., 2007</xref>). Thirdly, a recent study (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi et al., 2012</xref>), showed that volumetric or atrophic effects on the registered diffusion-weighted images are negligible in the corpus callosum if our newly developed rigorous spatial normalization is employed for quantitative FA comparisons. As expected, the FA in the corpus callosum was significantly reduced in the multiple sclerosis group, which can be interpreted as a kind of physical microstructural “thinning-out” effect that leads to a loss of diffusion barriers within the WM. Moreover, within the multiple sclerosis group, the individual FA reduction was significantly correlated with the individual increase in extrinsic curvature; thus, pointing to an association between individual WMV reduction and microstructural WM damage (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). These findings of early FA and volume reduction in the corpus callosum are congruent with previous studies showing early degeneration of the corpus callosum over 1 year following the first acute inflammatory episode in patients with multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bb0005 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Audoin et al., 2007; Ranjeva et al., 2003</xref>). A second ROI, encompassing the whole WM, showed very similar effects to those seen in the corpus callosum ROI; therefore, it seems likely that findings in the corpus callosum are representative of the whole WM (<xref rid="f0060" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0135"><label>4.4</label><title>Cortical thickness</title><p>A low, but significant reduction in cortical thickness was seen in the multiple sclerosis versus the control group (3.6%). This seems relatively small compared with other studies (<xref rid="bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese et al., 2007, 2013</xref>), but may be explained by the low degree of patient disability in the study presented here. In a histological study, relative neocortical thinning of 10% was reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Wegner et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast to the findings of Sailer et al. (2003), a significant relationship between EDSS and cortical thickness was not established in this study, which may be due to the lack of effect on the cortical GM. However, one patient in our multiple sclerosis group (described as an “outlier” in <xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>) differed significantly from the other patients due to their significantly low GMV. Interestingly, the curvature of this patient was less increased than other multiple sclerosis patients, as would be expected when the WM and GM are both atrophic and, therefore, virtually no GM–WM disproportion exists.</p></sec><sec id="s0140"><label>4.5</label><title>Reliability of cortical curvature estimates</title><p>The reliability of the FreeSurfer program for cortical reconstruction, GMV and WMV, and cerebral surface measurements has been assessed previously in a number of studies (<xref rid="bb0090 bb0100 bb0105 bb0125 bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2012b; Keller et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2006; Rosas et al., 2002</xref>) and cortical curvature analysis has also been performed on different neurological or psychiatric patients (<xref rid="bb0175 bb0180 bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Ronan et al., 2011b, 2012; Voets et al., 2011</xref>). The inter-individual variability of 3.92% (CV%) in whole-brain-averaged absolute extrinsic curvature (see Table 2) was considerably smaller than the variability of the absolute WMV in our control group (13.03%; see Table 1). The low variability in the cortical extrinsic curvature of less than 4% is remarkable, because no normalization to ICV, age, or gender was employed. The cortical extrinsic curvature, therefore, seems to represent a robust and sensitive biomarker for the detection of changes in the GM–WM proportion. A previous study in healthy controls showed mean values of 0.138 mm<sup>− 1</sup> for the whole-brain-averaged cortical curvature and 2.585 mm for average cortical thickness (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2012a</xref>), which seem to differ from the values reported in this paper. However, if we assume that both scanners differed in linear length calibration by a factor <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> = 2.59 mm/2.50 mm, their average extrinsic curvature would result in <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> × 0.138 mm<sup>− 1</sup> = 0.143 mm<sup>− 1</sup> and would thus fit well into the 95% CI of the whole-brain-averaged absolute extrinsic curvature of healthy persons seen in this study. This observation may suggest that even small differences in geometric size calibrations may be important when comparing quantitative results between different scanners or system configurations (see also <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2006</xref>). In <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, there seems to be a slight age dependent trend of a decreasing curvature in the control group. This could have occurred by chance (not significant), but would also fit with the finding that the WMV is less affected in “healthy” aging than the GMV (<xref rid="bb0085 bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Grossman et al., 2002; Vernooij et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><label>4.6</label><title>Consideration of intrinsic curvature</title><p>Two types of cortical curvature may be examined in patients with multiple sclerosis. The first type, the <italic toggle="yes">extrinsic</italic> curvature or <italic toggle="yes">mean curvature</italic>, is a curvature that arises from the mechanical folding of the surface, and, as such, is not a property of the surface itself, but rather of how it is embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) space. Extrinsic curvature changes, if a bendable, but non-elastic two-dimensional surface is folded within a 3D space. For example, if we roll up a <italic toggle="yes">flat</italic> piece of paper into a cylinder, the extrinsic curvature <italic toggle="yes">c</italic> changes, but not the second type, the Gaussian (or <italic toggle="yes">intrinsic</italic>) curvature. In a bendable, but non-elastic, and non-stretchable surface, we cannot change the intrinsic curvature without destroying the surface. For example, it is not possible to fit a piece of paper (Gaussian curvature = 0.0 mm<sup>− 2</sup>) to the surface of a sphere (Gaussian curvature = 1 / <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup>) without producing folds and tears (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Ronan et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we concentrated on the <italic toggle="yes">extrinsic</italic> or mean curvature. FreeSurfer software also measures Gaussian (or intrinsic) curvature of the cortex. The <italic toggle="yes">intrinsic</italic> curvatures of the patients' cortices were also significantly affected by the atrophy, but showed higher intra-group variability, were less significantly reduced (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 4.18, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0001), and were not so specific than the extrinsic curvatures. Thus, the results about the intrinsic curvature were not reported in detail here.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><label>4.7</label><title>Functional relevance of cortical extrinsic curvature increase</title><p>Individual disability as expressed by the EDSS was better explained by the extrinsic curvature increase of a patient than by the estimated individual volumetric loss of WM brain parenchyma (ΔWMV) or the WM lesion load (<italic toggle="yes">Part IV-b</italic>). The weak correlation between EDSS and lesion load might be explained by the fact that the (scalar) measure “lesion load” is per se a rather insensitive index because it does not account for the varying functional relevance of different lesion sites. However, it seems to be interesting for further studies to compare how T2w/FLAIR lesions would be correlated to cortical curvature alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><label>4.8</label><title>Methodological limitations and future research directions</title><p>The results presented here are based only on one single observation per patient, and more assessments over time would be required to define cortical curvature as a longitudinal biomarker of WM atrophy. Furthermore, this study did not examine the prognostic value of the cortical extrinsic curvature for disease progression. The pre-diagnostic levels of WM in these patients are unknown; thus, the degree of atrophy over time and with increasing severity of illness cannot be elucidated. The use of the EDSS as an indicator of disease progression has known limitations due to subjective error and inter-rater variability (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Reilmann et al., 2013</xref>). Our group of patients with Alzheimer's disease was not age-matched to our control group, as this group served only as a reference for patients with pronounced WM and GM alterations.</p><p>This study did not account for the presence of cortical lesions, which potentially could affect the cortex segmentation and reconstruction and could, therefore, also affect local estimates of cortical curvature. However, inspection of the T2-weighted and FLAIR images revealed that relevant lesion load could not be observed in our multiple sclerosis group, thus, the cortical GM was likely intact in these patients. In context with the finding that nearly every patient showed an increased curvature, it is very unlikely, that the increase is relevantly driven by lesions. This hypothesis would be further supported by the fact that the multiple sclerosis patients had only a small reduction in cortical thickness and a cortical GMV in the range of the control group, with the exception of one patient.</p><p>This study did not explore any relationship between the curvature alterations and lesion load in multiple sclerosis patients. This might form the basis of future investigations in larger sample groups to explore the effects of specific lesion patterns, like those demonstrated in the study by Giorgio et al., which showed regionally different effects on cortex geometry (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>). It would also be of interest to study WM–GM disproportionality with further quantitative MRI measures, such as myelin water fraction (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Kitzler et al., 2012</xref>), MRI spectroscopy measures, and histopathology, in order to investigate which predominant factor drives the WM–GM disproportionality and thus the WMV loss. From a translational point of view, it would be also interesting whether cortical curvature correlates better with higher cognitive functions than conventional structural marker like lesion load or volumetric atrophy marker.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0160"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present findings provide further evidence that WM atrophy is already present at the very beginning of multiple sclerosis and in every patient suffering with this illness. The increased cortical extrinsic curvature could be used to classify 29/30 patients to the multiple sclerosis group, thus providing a sensitive indicator of WM loss. Overall, the average WM atrophy that we estimated in these 30 patients was 13%, which would be difficult to visualize with conventional MRI methods (2D slices, thickness &gt; 2 mm). However, the specific curvature increase, used as a surrogate measure of WM–GM disproportionality and correlating with FA and EDSS, suggested that WM reduction in this population with multiple sclerosis might be involved in the pathological disease processes that occur independently of GM degeneration. Thus, WM–GM disproportionality and the cortical curvature measurement should be considered as a potential monitoring tool in this devastating, degenerative disorder, and this warrants further assessment in future multiple sclerosis research.</p></sec><sec id="s0165"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gts0005">Transregional Collaborative Research Center</funding-source> SFB-TR 128 Project B5/B6 and by grants from the <funding-source id="gts0010">German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF</funding-source>, “German Competence Network Multiple Sclerosis” (KKNMS)).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Audoin</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ibarrola</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Malikova</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Soulier</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Confort-Gouny</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Duong</surname><given-names>M.V.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Reuter</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Viout</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ali-Cherif</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Cozzone</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Pelletier</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ranjeva</surname><given-names>J.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Onset and underpinnings of white matter atrophy at the very early stage of multiple sclerosis—a two-year longitudinal MRI/MRSI study of corpus callosum</article-title><source>Mult.

Shown are coronal and sagittal sections of a healthy control subject (A), a patient with multiple sclerosis (B), and a patient with Alzheimer's disease (C). The T1-weighted MRIs are superimposed by structural labels of cortical surfaces (yellow, red), WM (green, white) and cortex (brown) as generated by FreeSurfer software. The mean rectified curvatures of the left (green) and right (white) hemispheres were 0.135 mm<sup>− 1</sup> (left hemisphere [lh])/0.135 mm<sup>− 1</sup> (right hemisphere [rh]) for the control subject and 0.179 mm<sup>− 1</sup> (lh)/0.168 mm<sup>− 1</sup> (rh) for the patient with multiple sclerosis. Cortical WMV was about 15% less in the multiple sclerosis patient relative to the control subject (control: 266,960 mm<sup>3</sup> [lh], 267,879 mm<sup>3</sup> [rh]; multiple sclerosis: 219,878 mm<sup>3</sup> [lh], 225,045 mm<sup>3</sup> [rh]) and about 33% less in the patient with Alzheimer's disease (181,802 mm<sup>3</sup> [lh], 179,325 mm<sup>3</sup> [rh]). By comparing A and B, the increased curvature (&gt; 24%) and the WM atrophy can be clearly seen in the patient with multiple sclerosis, while the patient with Alzheimer's disease has obvious WM atrophy, but the cortical curvature looks not only similar to that of the control subject, but is also quantitatively very close to the control subject (0.139 mm<sup>− 1</sup> [lh]/0.138 mm<sup>− 1</sup> [rh]). The average cortical thicknesses showed no relevant (&lt; 2%) differences between the control subject, the multiple sclerosis patient, and the patient with Alzheimer's disease (control: 2.344 mm [lh], 2.357 mm [rh]; multiple sclerosis: 2.314 mm [lh], 2.338 mm [rh]; Alzheimer: 2.391 mm [lh], 2.357 mm [rh]). In addition, the total surface areas of the hemispheres of the control subject and the multiple sclerosis patient showed no relevant (&lt; 2%) differences (control: 87,562 mm<sup>2</sup> [lh], 87,565 mm<sup>2</sup> [rh]; multiple sclerosis: 86,202 mm<sup>2</sup> [lh], 89,116 mm<sup>2</sup> [rh]). In contrast to the multiple sclerosis patient, the patient with Alzheimer's disease has an about 20% smaller cortical surface relative to the control subject (70,957 mm<sup>2</sup> [lh], 70,029 mm<sup>2</sup> [rh]).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="gr8.jpg"/></fig><fig id="f0045" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Illustration of the estimated local cortical extrinsic curvature in the sample control subject (A–C) and the sample patient with multiple sclerosis (D–F) of <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Shown are slightly smoothed local extrinsic curvatures of the cortex (pial surface) (A, D) and WM surface (B, E). Negative regions are folded-out and shown in green (gyral), and positive regions are folded-in and shown in red (sulcal). In this study, we only considered the “folding” or extrinsic (mean) curvature, which is defined at every point P on the surface (for details see text books). At each point P, the extrinsic curvature of a plane curve can be illustrated as the inverse of the radius <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">osculating circle</italic>, a circle with a certain tangency and curvature so that it best fits the curve in a certain point P (curvature = 1 / <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>). The WM surface of the multiple sclerosis patient (E) looked obviously “shrunken” with sharper edges at the outer gyri when compared with the WM surface of the control subject (B) with normal WMV.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="gr9.jpg"/></fig><fig id="f0050" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Cortical mean curvature related to disease duration (A) and age (B).

The three orthogonal brain sections illustrate the ROI employed for averaging the FA of the corpus callosum. Note: the patient with the strongest FA reduction (FA close to 0.200) was regarded as an outlier and excluded from the estimation of the regression function, because the total GMV of this patient (female, 56 years, disease duration 179 month, relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis) was also extremely and untypically reduced relative to the other multiple sclerosis patients (19% reduction, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), the WM lesion volume was 400% increased relative to the mean of the other multiple sclerosis patients (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.00005) and the cortical WMV was reduced by 33.5% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) relative to the other multiple sclerosis patients.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="gr11.jpg"/></fig><fig id="f0060" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>Cortical curvature in relation to microstructural WM integrity as assessed by FA.

AD patients display hippocampal atrophy, memory impairment, and other cognitive and axonal loss. The ultimate outcome of AD is neuronal loss and catastrophic memory deficits. While many studies have focused on amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology and cortical atrophy in the cortex and subcortical gray matter, less attention has been paid to the significant white matter (WM) abnormalities, such as demyelination, microglial activation, loss of oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytosis, that have been characterized recently (<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="para0014">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology provides a path to more thoroughly explore associations between white matter abnormalities and AD related phenotypes. With increasingly high-resolution characterizations of brain structure, MRI now plays an important role in the diagnosis of AD (<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">Rathore et al., 2017</xref>). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) detects abnormal changes in neuronal fibers at the microstructural level in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and provides data on the integrity of brain circuitry (<xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">Rathore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). DTI detects the 3-dimensional (3D) diffusion of water molecules along the main fiber directions (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Basser and Pierpaoli, 2011</xref>), giving rise to specific features such as mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter regions that have been demonstrated to be strongly correlated WM damage and cognitive impairment (<xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">Naggara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite the roles well-established AD biomarkers such as amyloid-β deposition and inflammation are known to play in disrupting WM integrity during the early stages of AD, only a small number of studies to date have focused on specific DTI features to identify associations between CSF-biomarkers and changes in WM integrity in AD (<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Bendlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">Melah et al., 2016</xref>). Given this lack of attention, several key questions remain to be explored regarding variations in WM associated with AD-related traits, including the identification of brain regions in which WM changes most strongly correlated with presymptomatic AD and the identification of molecular and biological processes that underlie WM abnormalities that develop as a result of disease progression.</p><p id="para0015">To help address these critical questions, we systematically interrogated DTI, genetic, gene expression and clinical data generated on participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Given amyloid beta depositions and neurofibrillary tangle pathology are associated with a range of pathophysiologic changes in the brain, including axonal degeneration, disruption of cytoskeletal equilibrium, and synaptic dysfunction (<xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">Mandelkow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Cardenas et al., 2012</xref>), we sought to characterize covariation structures between DTI-derived features and AD-related traits such as CSF tau/p-tau and Abeta levels, episodic memory scores, and metabolic activity and amyloidosis (PET) during disease progression. Specifically, we employed a systems biology framework to organize, process, and integrate these data and then characterize the associations among the different dimensions (imaging, molecular, and clinical) of data. Our framework provided for a completely data driven approach to first rank-order all brain regions with respect to their ability, through DTI-derived features, to discriminate between AD cases and controls. Then, from the top ranked brain regions, we systematically modeled white matter microstructural abnormalities in AD to identify 1) regional differences in microstructural changes; 2) correlations between AD-pathology related endophenotypes and brain region specific DTI-features; 3) key biological processes underlying WM pathology by integrating DTI and gene expression data; and 4) AD susceptibility loci associated with microstructural changes in AD. From this integrative analysis, we identified several DTI-derived features that were not only strongly associated with AD-related traits, but that were associated with known genetic risk loci in known AD-risk genes such as <italic toggle="yes">CELF1.</italic> In addition we identified an immune-associated gene network in blood that was strongly associated with these DTI features across all brain regions, providing a complementary view of disease progression and therapeutic strategies for AD.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Study participants</title><p id="para0016">We obtained the data used in this study from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 by a public-private partnership led by Michael W. Weiner. Participants were recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. ADNI participants consist of older individuals, aged 55–90, who are cognitively normal (CN), or who have significant memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or clinically diagnosed AD (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.adni-info.org/" id="interref0001">http://www.adni-info.org/</ext-link>). The ADNI dataset includes structural MRI and PET scans, longitudinal CSF markers, and performance on neuropsychological and clinical assessments. In addition, the ADNI data include APOE and genome-wide genotyping generated on study participants. We analyzed diffusion tensor imaging scans from 269 individuals, including 57 CN older individuals, 33 individuals with SMC, 76 individuals diagnosed with EMCI, 27 individuals with LMCI, and 76 individuals diagnosed with AD. We note that not all individuals included in the analysis of the DTI data had matched clinical and pathological data (<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>).

For correlation analysis of co-expression network and DTI features we used 105 individuals (CN=34, MCI=56 and AD=15) who had matching blood expression and DTI data. For the genetic association analysis we used 225 individuals (CN=46, SMC=29, EMCI=62, LMCI=25, AD=63) from ADNIGO/2 who had both DTI scans and genotyping data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0005"><label>2.2</label><title>Acquisition of the diffusion weighted MRI data</title><p id="para0018">Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) data were downloaded from the ADNI website.

However, this may not be the case for all brain regions. For example, it has been reported that axonal bundles spread, bend, or cross one another in white matter between the cerebral cortex and nuclei (<xref rid="bib0081" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). With the NODDI model, the dispersion in axon orientation can be explicitly represented. Therefore, in addition to the 8 DTI-based features, the orientation dispersion index (ODI) (<xref rid="bib0082" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) was chosen as the NODDI-based features in our analysis for its ability to quantify angular variation of neurite orientation and the extent of orientation dispersion about the mean orientation.

We stratified the traits into two sets as clinical/cognitive scores (ADAS13, MMSE, MOCA, RAVLT, FAQ, Ecog scores, CDR) and AD-pathology (CSF-ABETA, CSF-TAU, FDG-PET and AV45-PET) that reflect different aspects of AD and investigate the relationship between DWI measures with them separately. We elucidated the correlation structure between the imaging feature endophenotypes and clinical/cognitive and pathology biomarker variables to investigate whether any brain region-specific imaging endophenotypes were predictive of clinical outcomes.</p><p id="para0034">Since DTI features are quantified at the unit of voxel, and given there are hundreds of thousands of voxels in each brain region, we first reduced the dimensionality of the data by computing principal components (PCs) from the voxel-level data for each region-specific DTI feature in each brain region. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established method in neuroimage analysis to reduce data dimensionality. As a data-reduction algorithm, PCA generates a set of new variables or principal components (PCs) that are orthogonal linear combinations of a given dataset to maximally explain the variance of the dataset (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Ghodadra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016</xref>). In this study, we performed principal component analysis with the voxel-level data for each DTI feature in each brain region, and took the first right-singular vector (i.e. the first principal component, PC1) of the standardized voxel-level data as the representative-voxel, called eigen-voxel in this paper. For each brain region, the voxel-wise DTI measurements were treated as a two-dimensional matrix with samples in the rows and voxels in the columns. We consider the voxels as individual variables. PCA was performed on the two-dimensional data using the prcomp function in R program language. We then used a respective PC1 as the representative of each region-specific DTI feature. As a result of this dimensionality reduction, we computed 9 eigen-voxels for each brain region, corresponding to the 9 DTI features. We then computed Spearman's correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">r<sub>ijk</sub></italic> between each clinical/cognitive (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>) and each eigen-voxel (<italic toggle="yes">j</italic>) in each brain region (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>). P value significance (<italic toggle="yes">P<sub>ijk</sub></italic>) of the correlation coefficient was computed via the asymptotic <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> approximation. Significant correlations were defined as those with Bonferroni adjusted P value less than 0.05 (adjusted by the <italic toggle="yes">i*j*k</italic> number of correlations computed).</p><p id="para0035">In addition to characterizing the correlation between DTI features and AD-related cognitive traits, we sought to prioritize the different brain regions with respect to their relevance to AD by comparing the magnitude of the correlations between the imaging features and cognitive/clinical measures. For this purpose, the various eigen-voxel and clinical/cognitive trait correlations for a brain region (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) were assembled into a composite importance score defined as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M9" altimg="si9.svg"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo linebreak="goodbreak">=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> denotes the number of correlation values (i.e. number of traits times 9 features). The importance score essentially computes the mean of the absolute value of the correlation coefficients across traits and DTI features. We have previously used this type of composite score to ranking the importance of key driver genes identified in gene networks across multiple brain regions (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, instead of ranking based on p values as was done in this previous work, we sought to use a quantitative sorting measure from the magnitude of the association in order to incorporate more information into this sorting measure. Finally, the composite importance scores (<italic toggle="yes">S<sub>k</sub></italic>) were normalized by dividing by the maximum score, and the brain regions were subsequently rank ordered by this normalized importance score. The brain region with the highest composite importance score was ranked as the top one, while the brain region with the lowest composite importance score was ranked as the bottom one. In this analysis, we used all available clinical/cognitive traits to give an unbiased ranking of the brain regions as only few participants have AD-pathology variables. However, we tested whether each top ranked region was also highly correlated with AD-pathology endophenotypes to predict white matter changes in AD.</p><p id="para0036">ROI analysis is a simple and effective means to investigate white matter changes in small, well defined regions on good quality data. In the ROI analysis, the average signal of all the voxels in a region is correlated with clinical outcomes. However, the previous studies have showed that this technique is prone to error and not suitable for the investigation of structures with complex boundaries or poorly defined changes in white matter microstructure (<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Hermoye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Froeling et al., 2016</xref>). To compare the performance of ROI and PCA, we performed a large scale correlation analysis between each voxel with PC1 and ROI from each DTI feature in each region. In all the 176 regions, 67.4% of the voxels are better correlated with PC1s than ROIs. The distributions of correlation coefficients from ROIs and PC1s are shown in <bold>the Supplementary Fig. S3</bold>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0013"><label>2.5.2</label><title>Correlation analysis of gene co-expression network and DTI features</title><p id="para0037">To further characterize the correlation structure between DTI features, clinical/cognitive traits, and biological processes, we constructed coexpression networks using the quality-controlled and normalized gene expression profiling data generated on the blood samples collected on ADNI participants (N=744). These data were downloaded from the ADNI LONI website (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu" id="interref0012">http://adni.loni.usc.edu</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">Saykin et al., 2015</xref>). These gene expression data were generated using the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Probe sets defined on this platform that did not map to any gene or that mapped to multiple genes were excluded from further analyses. For genes represented by multiple probe sets, the probe set giving rise to the most expression variation across all samples was selected as the representative for the gene. The purpose of choosing the probe sets with most variation is to keep the probe sets with signals (e.g. differentially regulated) among individuals and conditions (low variation means no difference between different conditions). So, with highest variation we can retain genes/isoforms have difference between case and control and exclude those genes have little/no difference (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Mancarci et al., 2017</xref>). In total, 17,849 genes were included for the gene expression analysis. We excluded 9 samples that were not associated with gender and age information, given gender and age information are needed to appropriately adjust the gene expression data for our analyses. This resulted in 735 samples being used for the co-expression network analysis.</p><p id="para0038">A gene co-expression network for the ADNI blood expression data was constructed using Multiscale Embedded Gene co-Expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Song and Zhang, 2015</xref>). This process involves first constructing a planar filtered network in MEGENA from significantly correlated gene pairs. The output of this step is then input into a multiscale clustering analysis to identify co-expression modules using different scales of compactness of modular structures controlled by a resolution parameter. The modules identified from this step are then compared to random Planar Filtered Network (PFN) modules generated by shuffling the link weights of the parent cluster to calculate statistical significance. Finally, to elucidate the structure of the significant coexpression modules, a multiscale hub analysis is run to identify highly connected hub nodes (genes) for each significant module. MEGENA modules identified via this process containing less than 50 genes were excluded from further analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on the modules to obtain the principal component vectors (eigen-genes) used in the gene expression-DTI feature correlation analysis. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis (<xref rid="bib0073" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) was performed on the significant gene modules to identify representative biological processes associated with the modules. Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses were carried out on the module eigen-genes and the DTI features across the 176 brain regions.

Then, the top independent SNPs in each set were selected if their p-values were less than 0.05 in the QT analysis. From these subsets of SNPs, the statistic for each set was calculated as the mean of these single SNP statistics. Empirical p values for each set were calculated from 20,000 permutations. In ADNIGO/2, a conservative significance threshold (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.00217) was used based on Bonferroni correction for 23 IGAP genes.</p></sec><sec id="sec0016"><label>2.8</label><title>Construction of CELF1 centered co-expression gene network in AD</title><p id="para0041">Previously, CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 1 (CELF1) is identified as GWAS significant gene in AD (<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Hinney et al., 2014</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> co-localizes with other <italic toggle="yes">CELF</italic> proteins and regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing, mRNA editing and translation (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Dasgupta and Ladd, 2012</xref>).

To identify such links we analyzed the DTI scans from the participants’ most recent visits and their association with the genotyping data in the ADNIGO/2 dataset (N=225) <bold>(Supplementary Table S11)</bold>.

In this study, we employed a data driven approach to rank order 176 brain regions with respect to their correlation with region specific DTI features and disease severity. The hippocampus, the cingulum, the parahippocampal gyrus right, the sagittal stratum, the superior temporal white matter and the fusiform white matter (FWM) right were the most correlated with clinical/cognitive traits. Most of these regions have been previously shown to be associated with AD related phenotypes, with some well demonstrated to play a central role in AD pathogenesis and progression (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Kuczynski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">Nir et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we identified that the parahippocampal gyrus is highly associated with white matter microstructural changes in AD. The hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of episodic and spatial memory and is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Axmacher et al., 2008</xref>). A pattern of increased MD has previously been found in the hippocampus of AD patients compared to normal individuals (<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). The cingulum on the other hand is enriched for WM fibers and is known to play an important role in in construction of memory networks by carrying axons that project pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 sub-regions of the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Kantarci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">O'Dwyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">Nowrangi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0064" ref-type="bibr">Sali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015</xref>). The WM microstructural changes and myelin specific pathology in the parahippocampal region have been identified in MCI and AD patients (<xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">Salat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">Solodkin et al., 2013</xref>). In another recent study carried out by our group, the parahippocampal gyrus was identified as the most affected region in the transcriptomic analysis of 19 brain regions in an independent AD cohort from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (<xref rid="bib0077" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Fractional anisotropy reduces specifically in cingulum in hippocampus and sagittal tracts in AD patients, suggesting that disruption of WM tracts occur near the medial temporal lobe (<xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>). A three year follow-up study showed changes in WM in the cingulum fibers and hippocampus (<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), the top two regions by our study. We further discovered here that the L1, MD and RD DTI features were all highly correlated with amyloid beta pathology as well as memory composite scores in regions most affected by AD. Fusiform gyrus plays a crucial role in facial recognition (<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Hargrave et al., 2002</xref>), and lower FA scores in fusiform gyrus were significantly associated with lower MoCA scores in the MCI group relative to normal controls (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Cooley et al., 2015</xref>). We also revealed a positive correlation between MoCA scores and myelination in the fusiform white matter right. Moreover, we found that the MMSE, MOCA, RAVLT, ADAS13, and CDRSB scores were all highly correlated with the L1, MD and RD DTI features, while informant everyday cognition (EcogSP) memory scores were highly correlated with all DTI-derived features in the parahippocampal gyrus right, the superior temporal white matter, and the fusiform white matter right.</p><p id="para0051">These results demonstrate that our findings are in agreement with previous findings of impaired WM integrity in the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus and the fusiform regions of the brains with MCI and AD. Most of the brain regions in our findings are more generic to cognitive impairment in general, and may not be specific for AD. However, our correlation analysis with AD-pathology biomarker variables revealed that L1, MD and RD features in the HIPPO-left, the HIPPO-right, the SS-left, the PHG-right, the CHIPP-left and the CHIPP-right are highly associated with amyloid burden but not any of CSF tau measurements. Previous studies showed that there was a sharp increase in λ1, which represents L1 measurement in AD (<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, 2014</xref>). In AD patients, it has been observed that regions with significant increase of λ1 that were concordant to those of RD and MD had substantial anisotropy changes (<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010</xref>). Since the degeneration leads to increase in λ1 or axial diffusivity, higher level of L1 is associated with worse memory scores and higher CDR score. The parahippocampal gyrus, the hippocampal cingulum and the sagittal stratum are the regions most impacted by axial degeneration and myelination during disease progression and thus they have the decreased white matter integrity (<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0071" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Further research is needed to explore the connectivity of the other top-ranked regions to confirm the disruption of WM integrity.</p><p id="para0052">The integration of gene coexpression network analysis with the DTI data led to identification of an immune-response gene subnetwork that was significantly correlated with demyelination and axonal injury, especially in the fusiform WM, one of the top regions we identified. Many studies have showed that immune response including the activation of microglia, release of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and enhanced oxidative stress, is associated with AD (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Britschgi and Wyss-Coray, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Frank-Cannon et al., 2009</xref>). Microglia exhibit region specific patterns of gene expression as well as phenotypic diversity in different brain regions associated with neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and aging (<xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">Olah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Grabert et al., 2016</xref>). Increased microglial activity was found mostly in WM regions relative to other brain regions in AD animal models (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2017</xref>). The immune enriched subnetwork was also correlated with WM changes. Further studies related to imaging of glial cell activation and WM changes in specific brain regions could potentially reveal a mechanistic understanding of the role of microglia response in WM microstructural changes. After examining some of the structural features of the immune enriched subnetwork, we identified <italic toggle="yes">SERPING1</italic>, a gene known to regulate inflammatory processes (a C1 inhibitor) during inflammation (<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Glezer et al., 2007</xref>), as one of the most highly connected nodes (hub nodes) in this subnetwork. <italic toggle="yes">SERPING1</italic> is known to play a crucial role in cortical development (<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Gorelik et al., 2017</xref>) and age-related macular degeneration (<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Ennis et al., 2008</xref>). We also identified another important gene, <italic toggle="yes">IRF7</italic> which is interferon regulatory transcription factor, modulates immune responses against Herpes simplex virus type 1 by effecting IFN pathway in Alzheimer's Disease (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2017</xref>). Our other hub gene PML (Promyelocytic Leukemia) plays important role in plasticity, circadian rhythms (<xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">Manners et al., 2018</xref>) and polymorphism in this gene was significantly associated with neuroimaging biomarkers in hippocampus and insular cortex (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="para0053">In addition to the characterization of gene expression and AD phenotypes associated with DTI-derived features, we explored the genetics of DTI-derived features in the hippocampus with respect to the known AD susceptibility loci and identified <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic>, which is contained in a risk locus recently identified in a large-scale AD GWAS (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al., 2013</xref>), as a potential genetic regulator. <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> co-localizes with other <italic toggle="yes">CELF</italic> proteins and regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing, mRNA editing and translation (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Dasgupta and Ladd, 2012</xref>). We observed that <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> was significantly associated with the establishment of WM integrity in hippocampus. <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> may play important role in myelination process and axonal injury. Of particular note is that the most significantly AD-associated SNP in this locus, rs2203712, is highly associated with higher FA levels, a score that reflects fiber density and myelination in WM. In IGAP, the SNP rs10838725 in <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> is associated with the expression of <italic toggle="yes">MTCH2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">FNBP4</italic> expression levels (<xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">Karch et al., 2016</xref>), and more recently it was found to be associated with delayed AD onset and decreased expression of <italic toggle="yes">SPI1</italic> in monocytes and macrophages. The SNP rs2203712 we identified<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> is contained in the same LD (Linkage Disequilibrium) block (97%) as the GWAS SNP rs10838725, and from the Brain eQTL Almanac (BRAINEAC) brain tissue microarray-based gene expression database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.braineac.org/" id="interref0014">http://www.braineac.org/</ext-link>) and as with rs10838725, rs2203712 is significantly assciated with <italic toggle="yes">FNBP4</italic> expression levels in the hippocampus (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value = 8.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup>).</p><p id="para0054">To better understand the functional pathways underlying <italic toggle="yes">CELF1’s</italic> regulation of AD pathogenesis, we identified a <italic toggle="yes">CELF1 centered</italic> consensus gene co-expression network based on three AD gene expression datasets including the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) AD RNA-seq data (4 brain regions) (<xref rid="bib0074" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), the MSBB AD microarray data in the hippocampus region (<xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and ROSMAP RNA-seq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">De Jager et al., 2018a</xref>). The consensus network was associated with neuronal functions such as synaptic signaling, transformation, myelin sheath, axonogenesis and neurogenesis. In addition, this network contained known AD risk genes such as <italic toggle="yes">PSEN1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TREM2</italic>. Given that the hippocampus is comprised mainly of grey matter and very sensitive to early changes in MCI and AD, our findings with respect to the hippocampus may represent secondary, indirect association effects. <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> and its associated gene network not only provide novel insights into disease pathophysiology, but they represent potential therapeutic targets. Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> was also contained in one of the top coexpression network modules associated with DTI-derived features from the inferior fronto occipital fasciculus right region.</p><p id="para0055">The results from the DTI data and those from our previous transcriptomic data from 19 brain regions (<xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) pinpointed the PHG as one of the most modified brain regions in AD. Therefore, PHG may serve as a potential important indicator for AD progression. More focused imaging and multi-Omics studies of the PHG may unlock some key mechanisms with respect to AD pathogenesis. Our study not only quantifies the vulnerability of 176 human brain regions to AD but also reveals their potential upstream genetic regulators as well as downstream manifestation in blood. However, there are important limitations of our study. First, while ADNI still remains the best and largest cohort with matched multi-omics and DTI data, the study contains only a moderate number of subjects and a very limited number of subjects have longitudinal DTI data. Therefore this cohort is less suitable for causal inference. To overcome this limitation, we used quantitative traits (QT) as phenotypes to substantially increase the detection power of variant association analysis over a traditional case-control setup (<xref rid="bib0067" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Further, while our study involved a great many traits and many associations, we applied very rigorous processes to contain false discovery rates. As such, the most prominent findings reported here are statistically significant after rigorous corrections for multiple testing. Another limitation with this study is the lack of inference of trajectories or causal sequences as ADNI currently has a very limited number of subjects with longitudinal DTI data. Moreover, this study is the lack of replication in the gene-based analyses. Meta-analysis results would increase our detection power. Further studies are needed to explore functional evidence of the <italic toggle="yes">CELF1</italic> SNP, which was found to be associated with DTI features and gene expression in AD. Notwithstanding these limitations, this study provides novel insights into the biological processes and key regulators related to white matter microstructural changes and the findings could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec0023"><title>Funding</title><p id="para0056">This work was supported in parts by grants from the <funding-source id="gs0001">National Institutes of Health</funding-source>/National Institute on Aging (U01AG046170, RF1AG054014, RF1AG057440, R01AG057907 and F32AG064904).</p></sec><sec id="sec0023a"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="para0056a"><bold>Emrin Horgusluoglu-Moloch:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Gaoyu Xiao:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Minghui Wang:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Qian Wang:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Xianxiao Zhou:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Kwangsik Nho:</bold> Writing - review &amp; editing. <bold>Andrew J.

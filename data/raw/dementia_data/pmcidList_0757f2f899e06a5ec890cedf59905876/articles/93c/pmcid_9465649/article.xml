Frequently, SVD is accompanied by deteriorating cognitive functions particularly including frontal-executive deficits manifesting in reduced cognitive speed, poorer working memory and reduced set-shifting ability (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sachdev et al., 2014</xref>). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to detect microstructural tissue alterations by quantifying the diffusion properties of water (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Changes in DTI measures, such as, reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and increases of mean diffusivity (MD), radial and axial diffusivity (RD and AD) were reported in normal appearing white matter in subjects with cerebral SVD and were more closely related to cognitive dysfunction than lesions that are visible in structural MRI (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Duering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Edde et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, the free water (FW) diffusion MRI model has gained particular interest in SVD, but also in other diseases of the brain (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Andica et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Bergamino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Duering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Ofori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The model determines a FW compartment that represents water molecules that are not restricted or directed and thus represents the extracellular space (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chad et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Pasternak et al., 2009</xref>) while the tissue compartment represents intra- and extracellular water that is restricted by physical barriers like axonal membranes and myelin (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Duering et al., 2018</xref>). Duering and co-workers (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Duering et al., 2018</xref>) have shown that in genetic and sporadic forms of cerebral SVD, an increase of FW is more closely related to the clinical status of patients than DTI measures representing the tissue compartment. Moreover, results from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative showed that free water imaging of the white matter can serve as an early stage marker for Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2019</xref>) and similar findings have been reported in Parkinson’s disease (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Burciu et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, a study in forty-seven older adults described that extracellular FW within white matter increases also with normal aging, and that the amount of FW is indirectly related to fluid cognitive functions (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Gullett et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We hypothesize that FW in WMH and in NAWM are more strongly related to EF with a speed component than conventional DTI and MRI parameters in a large community-dwelling cohort of elderly subjects free of stroke and dementia. We therefore evaluated the relative importance of the FW metric as a determinant of EF with a speed component compared to standard structural MRI measures and conventional DTI metrics by use of a random forest analysis. Based on the crucial importance of frontal-subcortical circuits in mediating EF with a speed component we also hypothesized that the effects of FW changes on cognition, if any, are most pronounced in white matter tracts of the frontal lobe than in other lobes. We examined the importance of the FW metric relative to other DTI and volumetric measures in 42 white matter tracts. A random forest analysis was used to rank the white matter tracts according to their importance for EF with a speed component. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study in neurologically normal community-dwelling subjects examining the role of the FW content in the global white matter and in specific white matter tracts EF with a speed component relative to other DTI and structural MRI measures.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1.</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P7">The Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (ASPS) is a prospective single-center community-based study established in 1991 on the cerebral effects of vascular risk factors in the normal aged (age range: 44–90 years) population of the city of Graz, Austria.

To assess white matter lesion load, we performed a T2w-FLAIR sequence (TR = 10,000 ms, TE = 69 ms, TI = 2500 ms, TI = 800/1100 ms (1.5/3 T), number of slices = 40, slice thickness = 3 mm, in-plane resolution = 0.9 × 0.9 mm<sup>2</sup> ).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5.</label><title>Preprocessing and image analysis</title><p id="P12">Diffusion data were processed using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et al., 2003</xref>) included in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, version 6.0.1) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2004</xref>).

In brief, the diffusion signal of each voxel was fitted to a two-compartment model. The tissue compartment was modeled by a diffusion tensor, and the FW compartment was modeled as isotropic diffusion tensor with a constant diffusion coefficient of water at 37 °C. The resulting FW values, ranging from 0 to 1, represent the relative contribution of the FW compartment in each voxel. The FW-corrected tensor represents the microstructure of the tissue compartment without the influence of FW. Tissue compartment measures (denoted by the subscript t) including mean diffusivity (MDt), fractional anisotropy (FAt), radial diffusivity (RDt) and axial diffusivity (ADt) were calculated by tensor-decomposition of the FW-corrected tensor.</p><p id="P14">Regional median-DTI measures were assessed by registering the T1 and FLAIR sequences to the diffusion space and by applying the transformation-matrices to the binary WM and WMH masks. The registration was performed with six degrees of freedom and a mutual-information cost function implemented in FSL-flirt (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Jenkinson and Smith, 2001</xref>). To ensure that the white matter (WM) mask was not affected by partial volume effects, caused by the registration into the less-resolved diffusion space, we used a robust threshold of 90% and inspected each registration manually. For each subject an individual normal appearing white matter (NAWM) mask was computed by subtracting the lesions (WMH masks) from the FreeSurfer segmented WM mask. Assessment of regional and global brain volume as well as regional segmentation including a mask for global WM, was performed on the T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite, which is documented and freely available for download online. Median values of FW-corrected axial diffusivity (ADt), mean diffusivity (MDt), radial diffusivity (RDt) and fractional anisotropy (FAt) were assessed in NAWM and in WMH using fslstats.</p><p id="P15">White matter tracts were assessed using FreeSurfer-TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) (version 7.2.2, freely available online <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu" ext-link-type="uri">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</ext-link>) which reconstructs 42 major white matter pathways using global probabilistic tractography with anatomical neighborhood priors (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tracula" ext-link-type="uri">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tracula</ext-link>). As input data of the TRACULA pipeline we used the eddy-current and FW corrected diffusion weighted MRI data. We performed a visual inspection of all tracts and we excluded 21 of the 226 subjects due to tract-reconstruction failures or registration-misalignments. Tracts of both hemispheres were merged. Averaged FW values were assessed in each merged region (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 25). Tracts included are: arcuate fasciculus, acoustic radiation, anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum bundle dorsal and ventral, corticospinal tract, extreme capsule, frontal aslant tract, fornix, inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus I, II and III, uncinated fasciculus, anterior commissure, and the corpus callosum (body central, body parietal, body prefrontal, body premotor, body temporal, genu, rostrum, splenium).</p><p id="P16">To estimate the volume of WMH and to assess median-DTI measures in WMH, binary masks were drawn on the T2w-FLAIR sequence by an experienced rater. WMH maps were generated by using a custom-written Interactive Data Language program as described previously (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Plummer, 1992</xref>). Thereby, the rater identified each lesion slice by slice by marking a point inside each lesion and the algorithm automatically drew the borders of the lesion. In case of misclassifications, the rater modified the lesion masks manually. WMH volume was obtained by fslstats (part of FSL), evaluated in the native FLAIR-space. Afterwards WMH volume was normalized by intracranial volume. Brain tissue volume, normalized for subject head size, was estimated with SIENAX (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), part of FSL (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). As a further potential determinant of EF with a speed component, presence of lacunes were also included. Lacunes were defined as focal lesions that involved the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, or brainstem, not exceeding a diameter of 15 mm.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.6.</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P17">Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 26, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the statistical software R (version 4.0.2; R: a language and environment for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The following imaging variables were included in the analyses: FW in NAWM and WMH, FW-corrected values of FA, MD, AD and RD in NAWM and WMH, normalized brain volume, normalized WMH volume and the presence of lacunes. After visual inspection of scatterplots between the imaging variables and EF with a speed component, WMH volume was ln-transformed and FW in NAWM was transformed exponentially to achieve a linear association between the dependent and the explanatory variables of the multiple linear regression. Thereafter, we performed partial correlation between imaging parameters and EF with a speed component adjusted for age. To determine the importance of imaging variables as determinants of EF with a speed component, we calculated a random forest regression. Random forest assesses the mean prediction of each individual variable while at the same time accounting for all other variables. Using the R package ‘party’ (version 1.3–5 (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Strobl et al., 2007</xref>) 1001 inference trees with unbiased variable selection were calculated using 4 and 5 randomly selected variables for each split (unbiased resampling scheme). From these trees conditional permutation importance, using the “mean decrease in accuracy” principle as importance measure for each variable, together with a 95% confidence interval from 400 repetitions, was calculated. This approach was chosen to account for the intercorrelation between predictor variables (multicollinearity), and to identify the variables with highest importance. A high conditional variable importance reflects the impact of the predictor variable on the outcome, when “controlling” for the other variables. Hence, the variable importance mimics the behavior of a partial correlation or linear regression coefficients (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Strobl et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).

As can be seen in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the association between FW in WMH and EF with a speed component was linear, whereas the association between FW in NAWM and EF with a speed component was exponential. Consequently, FW in NAWM was transformed for further calculations.</p><p id="P21">Partial correlation, adjusting for age, showed that almost all diffusion MRI measures and lacunes were significantly related with EF with a speed component (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) while no significant association existed for WMH volume and brain volume (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22"><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows two examples of the relationship between DTI measures and cognitive test results.

Similar relationships existed for DTI measures in the NAWM and cognitive performance.</p><p id="P23">Random forest regression showed that FW in WMH (Mean = 0.018, IQR = 0.016–0.020) and in NAWM (Mean = 0.016, IQR = 0.015–0.019) had the highest conditional variable importance for EF with a speed component (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Together the contribution of the two variables explain 48.8% importance for EF with a speed component while accounting for intercorrelations (multicollinearity). The other FW-corrected diffusion parameters showed lower importance for EF with a speed component. Among macrostrucutral brain alterations normalized brain volume showed highest importance (Mean = 0.010, IQR = 0.008–0.011).</p><p id="P24">The relative importance of FW for EF with a speed component was then assessed in a tract-specific manner. Linear regression analyses including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, BMI and smoking were used to regress EF with a speed component on each white matter tract. Results revealed an association with the fornix and the corpus callosum (body prefrontal, body premotor, genu) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). No other examined tract has been associated with EF with a speed component. The random forest regression ranked the fornix, the genu and the prefrontal part of the body of the corpus callosum as most important (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">In a cohort of community-dwelling subjects without stroke and dementia extracellular FW in WMH and NAWM are the most important determinants of EF with a speed component. The FW scalar outperformed other micro- and macrostructural brain measures such as FAt, MDt, RDt, ADt, WMH volume and brain volume when controlling for age. Similar findings have been reported in patients with genetic forms of small vessel disease (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Duering et al., 2018</xref>). Our study for the first time shows similar association in a community-dwelling cohort without symptoms or signs of cerebrovascular disease or dementia. The superior role of the FW signal as a determinant of EF with a speed component suggests that an increase of extracellular water in the brain’s white matter is connected with cognitive dysfunction in elderly individuals, while alterations in the tissue compartment, reflecting fiber structure are less important. Our study extends previous work by assessing FW in the white matter not only globally but also in a tract-based analysis. We found significant negative associations between FW and EF with a speed component in the fornix and the corpus callosum. The association between the fornix with EF with a speed component is in line with previous literature (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Burzynska et al., 2017</xref>).The association between FW in the corpus callosum and EF with a speed component indicates that age related loss of interhemispheric white matter integrity also determines cognitive slowing (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Banich and Belger, 1990</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Several studies have already corroborated the value of FW as a predictor of cognitive function with aging (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Edde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Reas et al., 2018</xref>). <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al. (2019)</xref> reported FW, corrected for hippocampal volume, to be the strongest predictor for cognitive dysfunction and cognitive decline, in a longitudinal study on 224 subjects with cognitive performance between 0 and 3 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 1982</xref>). Similar to our results, FW outperformed the conventional diffusion parameters. Our data indicate that metrics of FW are better suited to determine brain’s white matter microstructure than conventional DTI parameters or structural metrics to explain aging-related frontal-executive deterioration (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chad et al., 2018b</xref>). This notion gets corroborated by two recent studies demonstrating an increase of FW in the white matter (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2019</xref>) and the hippocampus (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Ofori et al., 2019</xref>) paralleling the continuum from normal cognitive function to Mild Cognitive Impairment towards Alzheimer’s disease. These results remained significant when controlling for brain atrophy. We extent this research by describing the association between FW and EF with a speed component in a large normal elderly cohort including separate indices for FW in WMH and NAWM.</p><p id="P27">The underlying pathophysiological mechanism leading to higher extracellular fluid content in subjects with cognitive dysfunction is still unknown. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al. (2019)</xref> assumed that FW can be used to understand the role of inflammation-associated edema in Alzheimer’s disease. Other substrates besides neuroinflammation such as vascular changes and neurodegeneration with subsequent CSF diffusion and perfusion effects, atrophy and a microscopic degradation have also been implied (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2019</xref>). There is indeed evidence that elevated blood pressure and arterial stiffness may trigger a pathophysiological cascade leading to increased FW content and subtle WM degeneration (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2017</xref>). The study authors suggested that increasing arterial stiffness leads to transmitted pressure waves on high-resistance cerebral small vessels. This can lead to endothelial injury, subtle breakdown of the blood brain barrier and fluid transudation as the basis of FW increase. Conceivably, the fluid passing the blood brain barrier then introduces toxic serum cytokines or reduces the clearance of interstitial toxins, leading to a breakdown of WM microstructure (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The involvement of vascular alterations gains support by the finding that diffusion alterations are largely determined by SVD. Finsterwalder and colleagues compared individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and SVD, including genetically defined samples and found that markers for SVD were strongly associated with diffusion measures (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Finsterwalder et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The fornix has in the past been shown to be associated with aspects of memory that are important for encoding, consolidation and recall of declarative memory (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>) but also with cognitive speed (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Burzynska et al., 2017</xref>) working memory, motor performance and problem solving (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Zahr et al., 2009</xref>). These results indicate that the increase of FW in the fornix in healthy elderly is not restricted to memory tasks, but rather is involved in a broader spectrum of cognitive abilities.</p><p id="P29">Age related decline of the integrity of global cerebral white matter has been observed. However, the disruption of white matter networks, i.e. specific regional white matter tracts critical for cognitive integrity might be more specific for cognitive deterioration in healthy aging. Hence, they yield the potential for a more precise picture of the association between microstructural white matter alterations and cognitive changes. Age related decline of the integrity of white matter have been reported to be more pronounced in frontal than in posterior brain regions (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Zahr et al., 2009</xref>), and in more superior compared to inferior regions (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>). These differences in white matter deterioration reflect a diverging vulnerability of the white matter. However, on the other hand the variation of deterioration in specific tracts might not be entirely specific to individual tracts, but instead can also be reflected by more global effects, common to the brain as a whole (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Using principal component analysis in older adults (71—73 years) on each of several DTI measures from eight white matter tracts, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Penke et al. (2010)</xref> found that a single factor explained approximately 45% of the variance in each measure. Also, many of the individual tracts loaded highly on each individual factor. Further, two of these global components were correlated with information processing speed. The authors concluded that these results underscore that individual differences in white matter integrity are shared globally throughout the brain and that they are related to processing speed. Consequently, we decided to examine microstructural white matter changes and its association with executive function with a speed component in a whole brain approach and in a tract-specific approach. By doing so, we found that whole brain white matter integrity and also the integrity of the fornix and the anterior parts of the corpus callosum were involved in cognitive functioning of our study participants.</p><p id="P30">Our findings indicate that anterior segments of the corpus callosum are particularly important for EF with a speed component. This result is in line with two studies in healthy aging (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy and Raz, 2009</xref>) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Raghavan et al., 2020</xref>) both reporting especially the genu of the corpus callosum to be associated with and predictive for cognitive change over time. One limitation of the study is its cross-sectional design. However, we examined the association of FW and EF with a speed component in a large cohort of community-dwelling subjects with a thorough clinical work-up. While our results match with current literature, future studies should consider the acquisition of multi-shell diffusion data which may improve the accuracy of the free-water model fit, and may allow distinguishing further biological components that contribute to the increase in free water. Another limitation of the free water metric is that we did not account for biases due to molecules in rapid random motion, such as the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) of blood as suggested by <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Rydhög et al. (2017)</xref>. The authors emphasize the importance for the correction of water molecules perfusing in randomly oriented capillary networks. The suggested three-compartment model in their scientific work was described to disentangle the effects of free water diffusion and perfusion, which is of clinical importance when trying to ascribe different pathologies to free water alterations. Future studies should take care of IVIM.A weakness of our study is that the DTI protocol was limited to twelve directions. This likely hampered the robustness of results. Yet, the protocol was performed with four repetitions. Importantly, Basser and coworkers have shown that multiple averages of diffusion tensor reconstructions provide comparable data to a protocol with 30- or more directions (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Basser et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally, the negative association between FAt in WMH and executive function with a speed component was an unexpected result that warrants further investigation.</p><p id="P31">Our study has shown that in elderly without overt cognitive impairment FW is a strong MRI determinant of cognitive slowing/EF. Longitudinal studies assessing the rate of change of FW with advancing age and its predictive value for cognitive dysfunction are warranted.
